Yet another calamitous outcome from 12 years of “new Labour”!\nThere are many reasons to look back on the period between 1997 and 2010 with regret. Blair promised “Cool Britannia” but gave us the laughable claim to end “Boom and Bust”, the death of David Kelly, the war in Iraq, the Bank or rather debt crisis, wasteful Millennium projects, sucking up to US neo-Cons and the nonsense of Post neoclassical endogenous growth theory. All were and some still are calamitous policies that have weakened and indebted Britain and the British worker because we were persuaded Blair knew best. British history is confirming Blair knew how to look after himself best at the expense of Britain as a nation no more and no less.\nThere is one issue which is only now beginning to emerge as a “crisis” and that is the mental health of the young. Again the “left” are banging on about resourcing when the problem is with the usual time delay for cause and effect squarely down to the period from 1997 onwards. The Tories can’t struggle off the leash entirely but the policies that affect the young are essentially Blair’s.\nIn 1997 and leading up to the hubris of the millennium young people were seen as the saviours of Britain. Young people were to be “invested” in and schools would deliver bright millennials who would deliver the “cool Britannia” success promoted by Blair. At that point, the “Cool Britannia” brigade were not millennials but Thatcher’s Children or even pre Thatcher, Pop idols and TV people in their 20’s and 30’s. Still, they could be “culturally appropriated” by Blair and of course they were.\nThe real millennials were fed a diet of New Labour Hubris, had to endure an education system which took away the competition and promoted an unrealistic sense of equality by “coursework assessments”. Grade inflation was the means of persuading parents that children were getting brighter and that a university education would transform working-class lives for young people. There was also a “gifted and talented” programme for anyone who could hold a pencil the right way up. Money was given to students in tertiary education, most of it went on drugs and booze. These were woolly and naive aspirations with “shonky” mechanics underpinning the social engineering.\nHowever what has created the current Mental Health crisis amongst the young isn’t just the woolly New Labour thinking of their early childhoods or its less deranged but not yet wholly abolished form, today. It is the social and economic context within which all this naive social engineering was and still is operating. Add in the breakdown of all too many families, and the stress of single parenthood and you have just about the worst context within which to lack wealth, have debt and possess a second-rate degree.\nThe outcome of the whole lot; social engineering, educational tinkering and context, from 1997 to the present day has in too many instances resulted in more crime from the unemployed second generation ex-industrial and agricultural workers; and rising levels of mental health problems for the employed working and middle classes. So how do we analyse the problem at Blue Revolution? And what would we do to put it right?\nFirstly the workplace was described as a place of opportunity for the new graduates. How many proud parents from derailed working class communities believed that a student loan was money well borrowed. Whilst their proper working class jobs might have been rendered uneconomic by the standards of the global labour market, their kids with degrees would be able to cut it with the worlds best. Or perhaps not. The market for degrees is unlike the state education system, overall fiercely meritocratic. Having borrowed to get their degree the youths returned to their working-class communities to the sort of work they were doing before they left. The additional problem for many was that unskilled migrants had taken up much of the “work offer” limiting opportunities whilst driving the wage level down to the minimum wage. (NB the minimum wage was needed by New Labour because without it mass immigration would have resulted in starvation wages for working people). The minimum wage has become the maximum wage for too many young people.\nSo that’s the impact of the unplanned for globalisation of labour, student loans and too few good jobs for the thousands of graduates the system churned out, immigration and the minimum wage. If that were not enough, what else has contributed towards the mental health problems of the young?\nWell, “economic reality” affects the poorer young more than say someone like Euan Blair. Most of the graduates from the run of the mill Uni’s know they have been ripped off to help keep a supplicant socialist industry funded. Higher education (like most of the education sector) is the “intellectual” wing of the Labour Party and so who cares if a few poorer kids get into debt to fund this important left-wing leaning national industry.\nSo with all the disadvantages of competing at the bottom end of society, with debt and diminishing opportunities in their own communities, the poorer student has to stand back and watch as the sons and daughters of the elite, more often than not a taxpayer-funded elite, hoover up the few decent jobs that there are in what apart from “the City” remains the lucrative part of the labour market, the top ranks of politics and the public sector.\nThe students from poorer backgrounds have the same expectations as the Blairs. Blair was great at selling a dream. Unfortunately, it was a dream few could achieve. So the final insult to the poorer young and students is that they are given a sense of personal failure. This isn’t delivered in the usual way by pushy parents. Modern poorer parents are genuinely sad about their children’s limited opportunities with debt and worthless degrees, and sad about their own gullibility at believing the worthless Blair mantra “education, education, education”. So the expectation that creates the sense of personal failure is the hubris of new labour and it’s belief that supporting a client “industry” like education with student debt was a way of killing two birds with one stone and delivering “Cool Britannia” and making most of Britain’s young globally competitive.\nUnfortunately, we can see now that with weak economic fundamentals this hubris is causing depression, feelings of hopelessness and catastrophe. This is however only amongst poorer kids with their debt, worthless degrees, no home too “own” and the prospect of losing what little inheritance they might get as the state, supporting another “industry”, cares for their ageing unemployed parents.\nOn a positive note, at least we can see the state sorting out the problem by piling money into “Mental Health”. Perhaps however if the present “state” were to shrink and let people run the country with some semblance of a constitutional monarchy we wouldn’t need a Mental health “industry” at all. Just a thought.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_where-are-the-weaknesses-in-the-main-parties-as-we-move-towards-a-general-election/content_211.html": "Where are the weaknesses in the main parties as we move towards a General Election?\nLet us start with the Conservative Party. Probably the only credible party of government in England and Wales. Whilst the Scots Nats are in Government in Scotland they can hardly be described as credible given their obsession with independence and lack of any grown up economic literacy. An independent Scotland would be bankrupt within five years but Sturgeon and co will have done Ok out of it before the collapse.\nThe Conservative Party is the party of the Nation State but a Nation State that still reflects the interests of those large corporations that are doing very well living off the fat of the nation’s debt. They can see there are problems with the way the nation operates, but they have no credible solution to solve the problems other than more of what has been tried before. More privatisation, more tax and National Insurance, more attempts by the public sector to cut services as it models itself on the private sector by simply creating more tax payer funded millionaires. The Tories aren’t going to be revolutionary but at least for the time being the engine of the nation state still runs.\nThe Brexit issue is also a bit toxic as there will be consequences following withdrawal from the EU. We argue these consequences might look bad, falling house prices (won’t that upset the banks), reduction in value of the Pound, and issues around migration. However, these are the issues that drive the debt and house price based economy and as such any change is in the long term going to be positive. The conventional parties will not want to see the economy contract and as now will simply tax us more to make up for reductions in the Governments income. The Tories like the other parties don’t recognise that it is we the people who’s interests they should serve and it is the cost of government, not our services that should be cut. But who is going to do that?\nWe think the Tories will win the election but with a small majority as now and a mandate to fudge and deplete the terms upon which Britain leaves the EU. Probably a fudge on the Customs Union to keep world trade out of the EU via Britain’s back door. That should keep the EU staffers happy.\nLabour are schizophrenic with a Blairite wing who still hanker after the “third way” mumbo jumbo and the “hard left” who hanker after a class war long after the “revolutionary” industrial and agricultural classes ceased to exist in any revolutionary form. They have morphed into the sad spectacle of what is described as the “underclass” the second and third generation unemployed industrial and agricultural workers. A horrible term for a group for whom the Blair “third way” offered the loss of work, family, status, and “self-reliance” and ushered in a life of ignorance and idleness on the dole. Labour have become out of step with all the main constituencies the Blairite middle class will vote Tory or Lib Dem or Green. The inner cities with their “culturally progressively” Labour Party branches will continue to return most Labour MP’s\nThe Lib Dems all but annihilated in 2015 will make a striking come back with an offer that every well-paid state “staffer”, banker and Remainer will support. The Lib Dems like the Green’s are terribly well intentioned but have no grasp on the realities of how their policies drive an economy to the brink of failure. They like the Green’s and Labour believe in the transformative power of the state, yet experience tells us that the state is incapable of transforming anything because it can’t cut costs and can’t transform itself.\nFinally the Green’s and Ukip. The Greens will offer socialism with a solar panel or two. Completely missing the point that the aggregate demand they seek to stimulate through “anti-austerity” simply allows the west to illegitimately gobble up more of the planet than in reality we should be able to afford. They do nothing to challenge the debt based economics that funds our consumption and lifestyles. It is possible the Greens might get a seat or two.\nUkip were a one trick pony. Great trick…..we have seen it now it’s time to **** ***. We don’t anticipate any wins for Ukip, the Tories will keep most of their seats with a bit of shuffling around between the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems. Ukip will experience their first existential crisis.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_with-the-return-of-the-students-the-debate-about-pc-resumes-we-offer-a-comment/content_275.html": "With the return of the students the debate about PC resumes. We offer a comment.\nIn 2015 Oxford student Ntokozo Qwabe expressed the view that the statue of the patron of his Oxford scholarship should be removed as Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist and “looted Africa”. Ntokozo Qwabe’s view exemplifies the well-intentioned conflation of political correctness, moral relativism and anti-imperialism which has dominated the debate about Empire for a long time.\nOf course, Empire was and still is “problematic” but not always in the way imagined.\nWhen the likes of Rhodes and others took charge of parts of Africa they saw the potential to spread Christianity economic “freedom” and make money. Without being aware of it they proletarianised those who could be taken out of the tribe and placed in waged employment. Proletarianisation is the precursor of socialism.\nWith slavery diminished and urban tribalism in decline, these proletarianised workers were contracted or “freed” labour. They had, in theory, a choice for whom they worked. People will say that this was exploitation on a grand scale. We agree it is exploitation in a Marxian sense but disagree it was worse than tribalism if the end result became freedom from tribal oppression, particularly for women.\nWhat Rhodes and others did was replace the poverty brutality and sexual discrimination of tribal life, it’s uncertainty and ritualistic practices and allowed more modern values and agricultural techniques to generate greater economic value in Africa. Greater value than the indigenous population could hope to have created by repeating ancient rituals and superstitions.\nNow Ntokozo Qwabe makes a couple of points which whilst perhaps true, typify the limited and constrained nature of the debate. Firstly the value taken, what he describes as the “resources and labour of my people” were acquired by the Empire builders but they, in exchange, liberated people from what by modern standards would be seen as the horror of tribalism. Where this happened it spared some women the savagery of FGM and assisted people, in general, to create better lives for themselves. Well-intentioned westerners should reflect on tribal ritualism, gender-based and backed up by superstition before monstering Rhodes and his ilk.\nIn Africa and the Middle East today we have the collapse of feudal societies and their slide into tribalism. In Syria feudalism is sliding into tribalism and in Western inner cities, crime empires have for decades mirrored feudalism, now they resemble tribes. Capitalism has failed its global mission to proletarianised us all so the world can progress to socialism and beyond. Where this process has happened many more people benefit including Ntokozo Qwabe. Whilst not necessarily celebrating Rhodes we should at least have a balanced view of his and other Victorian’s long-term legacy.\nNtokozo Qwabe is benefitting from a western economic system that has liberated him and could go further and liberate his continent from religious separatism, tribalism fear and war if only he and others would stop bashing people like Rhodes.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_what-do-you-call-it-when-the-taxpayer-subsidizes-production-from-land/content_208.html": "What do you call it when the taxpayer subsidizes production from land…………..?\nWell it’s not feudalism? What do you call it when the ordinary tax-payer subsidizes labour? well it isn’t socialism? So what is it called when the ordinary taxpayer subsidizes capital? Well its not capitalism and it is probably the biggest rip off in world history. The land, the poor and the planet, are having to pay the price!! We need a planet saving, freedom promoting and capital preserving Blue Revolution!\nThis issue of the relationship between society and its means of production is elemental to our understanding how and why the world is as it is today and the likely success of the competing ideologies that are starting to wrestle for influence or supremacy in a world made fluid by the end, through bankruptcy, of the anglo/US two hundred year old trading hegemony.\nHow does it work? Well Feudalism is the theft of land value by an elite. The system has some legitimacy because only the elite are capable of maintaining order and thus making this economic model work. However once the land is subsidised by government it marks the end of land related authority. Should the land be subsidized? probably not! But neither should it simply be monetised by house building. This turns land value into cash for the few and not for the pleasure of the many.\nBeyond land based economic models we move to Capitalism and its massive productive output. Workers paid wages to enable them to create economic value for the capitalists. The Capitalists have supremacy. The State and the wage bill is paid by them but they still get a good return and political power. Socialism by contrast takes much of the Capitalists value and turns it into state expenditure. Subsidizing labour to the tune of health, welfare and pensions expenditure. Note it is the Capitalist who is paying the bill for welfare on the whole, either directly or via the taxation levied on their workers.\nFinally the end of this civilised model comes when capitalism can’t support the state or the States “socialist” aspirations and also can’t support itself as an economic system (i930’s then 1980’s and 2007/8 and finally 20??). At that point the Capitalist system is essentially dead and needs putting down but that could lead to social chaos. So the elite seizing an opportunity to make money put it on life support. That life support is a regime of taxpayer funded government and personal debt. The capitalist system is now no more than a valueless free market lantern show of of some of capitalism’s past glories such as “profit”. “Profit” is used to justify wealth for those who consider their wealth to be “legitimately” earned. There is no “legitimate” wealth in this system as the system produces no real value based wealth just debt.\nThe problem as we at Blue Revolution continually argue, is that the values (contract, choice and consent) that two hundred years ago transformed feudalism into capitalism and the values that transformed capitalism into socialism in Britain (health, and welfare), will likely disappear when the final embers of the unsustainable free market go cold. Then what?",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_our-revolutionary-aims-the-people/content_12.html": "Our Revolutionary Aims\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary\nAs we have traced the course of history from tribalism to socialism after World War Two, we have only made fleeting reference to elites. Every culture has had elites. Elites are the people Marx referred to when he commented that the history of the world was the history of class struggle. Elites are the people who take more of what the workers produce than the workers themselves. In our modern world this includes our politicians and many public servants.\nA state with much more public involvement if we ever get that far, will have people doing important work but they will be there by public approval, there will be no “status” or economic advantage to be had by being in parliament and indeed leaving the important state jobs or institutions will be no more a wrench or humiliation than changing work place. It certainly will not be like it is now with the spectacle of the powerful clinging on to rank, position and wealth after events like Brexit threaten their status. The state will therefore not have a separate identity from the people and power will be evenly balanced between the working people, who hold it and those who exercise it on their behalf.\nModern elites are not there because of historical accident as in feudal times or because they are talented scientists or businesspeople (whatever they might like us to believe) or because they are especially moral. They are there because they have party based political networks and influence. This is the legacy of the capitalist system retaining feudal power structures that were easily taken over by an ambitious bureaucratic state. With a modern economy reliant on government investment, the political state, rather than an economic elite, becomes the elite. Workers continue to be shut out of the political system by a new class of bourgeois socialist.\nThe people who take advantage of opportunities to enter the governing class do so out of concern about unfairness and inequality. However, a guilty conscience (11) is what their concern usually amounts to. They are unlikely to see their own privileged political and salary status, or their elitism more generally as a problem. They maintain a consciousness (12) based on their own privilege which prevents them seeing that their privilege occurs at the expense of the ordinary worker. Look at the pay of British Broadcasting Corporation ‘talent’ and the pay of the average licence fee payer, or the salary of an MP relative to the minimum wage.\nSo, the political and economic elite fret about the disadvantages faced by workers whilst ignoring how they have used the supposedly liberating principles of the once capitalist free society to feather their own economic and political nest. Karl Marx was the first to describe these people as bourgeois socialists. People who will fret about social unfairness but are happy to overlook economic unfairness if it benefits them to do so. It is a double standard, exactly what characterised the Victorian bourgeoisie with their use of contract, choice and consent to mask what was clearly the exploitation of the working people.\nModern bourgeois socialism therefore is an obstacle to economic and political progress as it ignores widespread political and economic unfairness but divides the working class using the trickery of identity politics to break the bonds that tie the world’s working people together. Working people of the world should unite against planet destroying economic unfairness but we cannot because we are differentiated by religion, sexuality, nationality and race. The bourgeois socialist elite might have the right values as they believe in Contract, Choice and Consent but they believe for ordinary workers the accent should be on exercising our rights not through acquiring greater economic equality or political power, but through nailing our identity. Other nations (and some people within our own nation) continue to be exposed to compulsion, coercion and control and this is not questioned by our elite seemingly happy to accommodate this outrage in the interests of diversity.\nThe elite need to be dealt with, not this time by a bloody revolution but by simply allowing “the people” the Blue-Collar workers of the world to determine how access to state power is gained, managed and maintained and this can be done through existing political arrangements. The arrangements just need tweaking! Basically, the current state works on behalf of a bourgeois elite and not for the people who pay for the state via their direct and indirect taxation. Because of this shortfall in influence modern government lacks legitimacy.\nThe problem of the state’s lack of legitimacy can be easily resolved but it must start with the workers of the western world uniting in the common cause of bringing an end to an economic and political system based on elitism, unfairness and identity. We must ignore the entreaties of the Bourgeois elites to engage us in petty sectarian squabbles over ‘identity’ and through democratic means bring down once and for all the elitist thinking that keeps us paying to support political systems over which we have no control.\nSUMMARY\nThe capitalist system created rights to contract, make choices and consent. These were originally legal and economic principles, but they have now become social in character, we use them in daily life. In the past the political elite extended these principles to more people to protect their economic system capitalism from revolution but now they only allow us to use them in the sphere of identity politics not the politics that governs us from Westminster or the White House. They are as unfair to us as the original capitalists, the so-called bourgeoisie, who hundreds of years ago exploited workers in factories. The new political elite do not want us to enjoy greater economic and political equality as their status would diminish.\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary",

A situation largely unchanged for thousands of years. This was the period when the feudal system was going through its death throes and capitalism was emerging as the new ideology on the block.\nThe old certainties so beloved of the rich and powerful were being challenged by an aggressive merchant class, the ‘bourgeoisie’ as Karl Marx (3) called them, who were not prepared to bow down to ‘God ordained authority” but who were increasingly of the opinion that they were as good as anyone else and indeed could prove this through their economic achievements. The capitalist system was being born. Its father the old feudal system, its mother Protestantism and the ranks of brave souls who had died to preserve it in the face of Catholicism’s stranglehold over economic growth and social progress in Europe.\nLike the feudal system, Catholicism (a feudal system with a Pope) did not like people to act freely politically or economically. Authority must be top down and sanctioned by God not humanity. People who could see an opportunity for self-advancement were initially considered a threat to this ancient system but through sheer perseverance over the next century they held their nerve and by the middle of the eighteenth-century Britain was a prosperous, technologically advanced capitalist nation. All this due to economic freedom based on revolutionary principles of contract, choice and consent which overthrew feudalisms reliance on control, coercion and compulsion.\nOn the continent, old ways continued; their feudal and Papal patronage gave rise to poverty and numerous revolutions. As with Brexit, Britons saw the writing on the wall even then.\nWith a protestant, Britain powering out value from its factories and farms, wealth grew, and with expansion into new global markets the culture of Britain’s capitalist system became embedded in Britain’s empire. Tribalism went into a slow retreat as Britain’s Empire became a force for liberation turning tribe’s people into workers. Just as feudal serfs became workers under capitalism, so the tribes of Africa where they were urbanised became workers too. The birth of a global working class and bourgeoisie or middle class had started. It is still work in progress.\nNow those on the traditional “left” will claim this was all immoral economic and cultural imperialism. However, we do not claim it was all good, but we need to be objective because our feudal or tribal family was riddled with inequalities and cultural abuse. Many horrors we still observe today were cultural norms until capitalism challenged the legitimacy of them. Those who claim some golden age of tribal or feudal culture are as naive as someone saying, “please sir I’d like to be treated like a fourteenth century serf”!\nNo person alive in the free world whose consciousness (4) has been shaped by contract, choice and consent would want to return to the tyranny of political life before capitalism. A world predating capitalism is still observed in parts of Africa the Middle and Far East where rights are contingent upon the erratic will of totalitarian ideology or a belief in the divine; the will of God. Twenty first century ‘right and wrong’ based as it is on contract, choice and consent bears little moral resemblance to a world based on Halal (good) or Haram (bad), Prescribed (good) or proscribed (bad). Liberated woman or Gay men, as well as animal welfare agencies will attest to that.\nThe idea of God was however important to early capitalism as it required the low cost associated with moral behaviour based on conscience, and not the costly control by fear based on religious compulsion backed by earthly retribution.\nSome socialists will say capitalism was unfair to the working class, women and minorities. Those with deeper knowledge of left-wing politics might ask about “alienation” (5) and “exploitation” (6). To which we would say; yes, all of those were major flaws in capitalism, identified by numerous thinkers in the nineteenth century, many of whom promoted a return to the old religious and feudal ways or dreamt up socialist utopias to get away from capitalisms divisive energy, drive and economic anarchy. That energy, drive and anarchy was necessary because as we will see it has ultimately liberated us all.\nThe reason it has taken time to embed liberty is because capitalism’s mother might have been Protestant consciousness and contract, choice and consent but its father was the feudal system. So, like feudalism it had a patriarchal (7) structure and status-based hierarchy. It might have created modern principles of contract, choice and consent and thus conferred “rights” but if you were poor, or a woman you could not exercise all those rights at least not until much later in the twentieth century.\nThe history of the last two hundred years has therefore been about rights that existed in theory for most and for some wealthy heterosexual, middle and upper class men, in practice, being extended to other groups too. So before condemning capitalism outright consider that without capitalism’s core principles these “rights” (Contract, Choice and Consent, freedom and democracy) would not have existed at all, for anyone! So, whatever your identity, the rights and freedoms you enjoy you owe to capitalism.\nMore latterly rights have extended beyond economic rights and now include rights to free expression. The right to be who we feel we are, unconstrained by social norms associated with tribal society, feudalism or with protestant conscience-based principles of good and bad behaviour. These rights have been described as “identity politics” and rather than being seen as springing naturally from humanities growing belief in freedom for all based on capitalist principles of choice and consent, the link to capitalism has been obscured by prejudice about capitalism by people who don’t understand it. Identity politics could not have existed before capitalism, capitalism liberated people from feudalism and religious oppression. Something forgotten by the traditional socialist ‘left’.\nIn socialisms defence however to extend rights to as many as possible and certainly to extend rights beyond those which were necessary for capitalism to function (rights to contract for work for example) it was necessary after the Second World War for the government to step in. Capitalism had some of its father’s feudal DNA so when capitalisms privilege was working for the benefit of the rich and workers were disorganised, no one in power saw any need to change anything. But as the capitalists themselves began to excessively exploit working people change was eventually demanded by the workers and granted by politicians.\nIn 1945 a landslide Labour Government came to power and introduced a programme which had been influenced by left wing thinkers and academics like Karl Marx. These enlightened thinkers could see that whilst capitalism had liberated humanity from much of feudalism it had stopped short of liberating everyone economically and the reason was that the value or wealth created by workers within the capitalist system, the capitalists kept for themselves using some of it to pay for their privileged system. The government had the power to intervene and re-distribute the capitalist’s wealth more fairly and did so nationalising industries and creating the welfare state.\nFor an adult population many of whom were born during Queen Victoria’s reign or raised by people born during Victoria’s reign it must have felt revolutionary, offering freedoms and opportunities only capitalist money could have afforded previously, such as the working classes entering the “establishment” and complex health care, free at the point of use. It was also still possible to rely on Christian values that ensured ‘moral’ behaviour continued at every level of society.\nUnfortunately, things started to go wrong in the 1950s. Where we are now (2019) is a legacy of things going wrong back then. Some of the things that went wrong are down to “the establishment” feeling threatened by the power of the workers entering the establishment and some of what went wrong is down to the workers themselves. The working classes who by, the 1950’s had fully absorbed the principles of capitalism were unable to recognise that they should challenge capitalisms inherent unfairness and elitism rather than using these characteristics to enhance their own occupational position at the expense of others. This has been the problem with socialism, it has become divisive just like capitalism misusing contract, choice and consent to promote personal and political self-interest. Hence Karl Marx coined the term ‘bourgeois socialism’(8)\nBlue Revolution is an attempt by informed “non-experts” to start a new revolution, to take the legacy of capitalism and socialism and forge a new future of freedom and personal fulfilment. Be part of this revolution by simply looking at things with a different consciousness. Using contract, choice and consent not with a view to self-advancement (bourgeois thinking) but with a view to making society better, fairer and healthier.\nSUMMARY\nElites have ruled working people for thousands of years. It was a situation we could not change because we as ordinary people did not have the power to change it. The means by which wealth was extracted from working people became more and more sophisticated until eventually the exploitation went on under a veil of legitimacy based on principles of contract, choice and consent. In themselves these principles enhance the lives of people but until recently only the elite could take advantage of them. We now have a crisis in the western economy and society, and we need to let the workers have more political power based on contract, choice and consent between the working people and their state.\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary",

Not much justice in that. V3\nThe England football team; millionaires to a man, the luvvies who cried buckets over Brexit and who are also millionaires and Sir Philip Green another millionaire have one striking characteristic in common; they owe their wealth to other peoples debt. The mechanism is straight forward enough. In the west we don’t produce enough actual value to support ourselves, so we have to borrow. This maintains what “Keynsians” refer to as “aggregate demand”. Aggregate demand in a closed market system should be value based and would generate jobs and production which should kick-start economic recovery.\nHowever in an economic system such as there is in the west where there are “impediments” to the functioning of this type of market strategy for growth namely, profit by outsourcing production to China, little by way of savings and huge corporations and collusive governments, aggregate demand is maintained via debt. As a result there are routes through which certain groups can prosper and who can turn the low income and indebtedness of others into huge wealth for themselves. This money flows to luvvies and footballers and retailers who fail to grasp the basic injustice that their bounteous wealth is due to ordinary people either taking out debt or via taxes helping to pay government debt.\nIf a just system was applied, then people would not be in debt but would take the modest amount of surplus value at their disposal (in classical terms this is called “wages”) and they would allocate it to football or entertainment (or both). A properly functioning market would ensure that the footballer or luvvie was never able to acquire huge wealth as competition would preclude this. In the west however we have the TV companies, football Premier Leagues and Corporations who game the system and facilitate the elevation of certain individuals, applying to them a price which is excessive and requires money to be extracted in larger and larger amounts from poorer and poorer people. This might be justified on the basis of protecting the brand.\nThe debtmeisters of the banking system also feed this debt monster so they to can “profit” from this valueless wealth too. The need for the economic system to maintain “aggregate demand” forces more and more people into debt, including governments. It also crystallises inequality and disadvantage. It makes too many frivolous people very wealthy and either like luvvies very sanctimonious or footballers very rich and gaudy. The luvvies complain about a system that they simultaneously love to hate but which puts vast amounts of valueless wealth into their too often over stuffed pockets. The footballers don’t pretend to understand the process but enjoy the fruits of this market malfunctioning. Who can blame them!!\nWe at a Blue Revolution don’t do “Red” revolutions, namely building up the size of the state to enable it to take money off people only to give it back to other people. We believe in making the market work haed to avoid the excessive build up of debt based wealth by people who’s wealth is well above their ability to create value. To put this right “aggregate demand” has to be re evaluated in importance and we have to accept economic shrinkage before creating real economic growth. We also have to look at “market function” and re engineer it so it does not create these “one person monopolies”.\n03.07.16 The fear of poverty drives our opposition to austerity. However the poverty we have in the west is moral not financial. Are these in any way connected?\nIn simple terms the answer to this question is yes of course moral contexts drive economic levers. In a pre agricultural tribal society certain actions were taken to prevent “immoral” behaviour, genital mutilation, tribal “rights” etc. As we progressed as a species we began to loosen the preventative practices and to exact punishments instead. The amount of value mankind was capable of crating in post agricultural tribes suggested that some amount of freedom was possible but transgression was dealt with swiftly. In some “modern” economies there is still some element of this moral or existential neurosis which is reflected in death penalties, amputations and torture. The US attitude to guns and punishment is very “fearful frontier-man” a form of tribalism. Saudi Arabia……enough said.\nIn the west a form of market based morality has emerged; anything you want as long as you pay for it! Due to the intersession of the state the elements of this immorality which within a tribal society would have threatened the very existence of the tribe are not only mitigated by government policy but become positively rewarded. The problem is that the challenges that would have emerged in a tribal society such as adultery, illegitimate births, one person acquiring too much value (theft then just reward now!) and which would have resulted in swift death or exclusion have no consequences now; but the long terms effects are just as existential. If anything this is another good reason to exit the EU as its long term moral course is definitely exaggerating inequality and promoting immorality on a continental scale. All of this is promoted by technocrats, bureaucrats and the anxious Remainers as “progressive” which of course it is not.\nThe immorality that infects the west spawns a loathing for the mechanisms of the state and society that creates or is seen to create the immorality. Particularly problematic if you are a North African migrant living in a Paris ghetto and observing the “culture” around you from your vantage point of welfare subsidized rage. Fathers alone and childless, mothers who’s children are reared by “strangers”; the unspoken abuse inherent within such arrangements, the loss of grandparents as feuding goes on and on, loneliness, and substance abuse. Welfare babies on an industrial scale. We turn away from confronting this moral poverty at our long term cost.\nThe need for the west to deal with this moral reality “humanely” seems to us to be the cause of the anti austerity sentiments and the movement that promotes it. Anti austerity is not exactly pro moral poverty; however it won’t be possible to deal with moral poverty unless we reframe the argument in favour of austerity and moral renewal.\nNow who has the confidence to go there?\nNB we do not include homosexual relationships or transgender issues in our moral critique. In modern societies as opposed to tribal ones, all individuals have to make economically sustainable moral choices and sexuality has no relevance. This contrasts with having casual welfare babies and being economically encouraged to do so.\n04.07.16 Global trade is stagnant and the EU is part of the problem. There is untapped value out there in places like Africa and free trade will unlock it\nBritain is the most networked country on the planet. The views of experts from the EU and other places like the US about Brexit only served to make us at a Blue Revolution feel that Britain needed to be put in its place by a bolshie global elite. Not for them the liberating effects of free trade but the continuation of established arrangements that promoted the big bureaucrats and the big businesses. This is yesterdays economic model. The future belongs to the quick witted and the enterprising not to those who desire a “rigged” operating environment which favours the cautious over the brave. If the world our children and grandchildren live in is to preserve peace and to respect the rights of others then we have to send trade into places currently wrecked by war. The development of trade relationships which are as far as possible symmetrical but complex as opposed to one sided and simplistic (selling arms for example to oil rich despots) should unleash the productive capacity of nations currently viewed as “failed”.\nThe wests past “progressive” march to war is a failed methodology for dealing with hard to reach and influence places; trade should be, as it always has been, viewed as a proxy for war and the United Kingdom is better places than most to lead the world in a revival of trade and real growth based on Contract, Choice and Consent. With this as Britains post Brexit strategic plan not only will Britain benefit but so will the rest of the world and unlike the anxious attached of the “Remain” camp our children and children’s children will be safer and freer to be who they want to be in a newly un-trading world which is currently hostile to them, us, and all that isn’t “traditional” as defined by the late 7th century.\n06.07.16 Britain’s Labour Party; can a Blue Revolution assist the non reds inside Jeremy’s bed?\nThe guys and Gals at a Blue Revolution can’t help but smile at the mess the British Labour party is in. Whilst the Blue in Blue Revolution has little to do with the Conservative Party the contrast between the Conservative Party and Labour Party is stark. The Conservatives have straight forward, empathetic and humane politicians from different racial backgrounds, most “progressive” and articulate (one or two exceptions noted however) and they are about to elect their second female leader. Then their is the Labour Party with its shameful need for an enquiry into anti-Semitism, its treatment of Muslim women and its incoherent ideology of anti this whilst being pro that. With its internal squabbles Labour is an object lesson in how not to seek power and present as competent to lead. And of course there is Tony Blair and whatever shakes out of Chilcot today. Old Labour, New Labour, hard to decide which is worse.\nSo what advice would we at a Blue Revolution give to the more sane and rational presumably “New Labour” types in the Corbyn party? Well there are some options: stay put and hope the left and Momentum loose their, well, momentum. Secondly decamp from the “Corbyn Party” and start a “New Labour” Party. The problem with this approach is that it certain that many such MP’s will loose out to hard left candidates at the next General Election in 2020. Another approach could be to decamp to another party before they start to identify their own candidates for 2020. The issue here is that the success of this strategy will depend on who was the runner up in 2015. If a moderate Labour candidate won against a Lib Dem or a Tory it may be possible to hold the seat if standing next time as a Lib Dem or a Tory.\nHowever given the complexity of British politics and the complex political landscape it will probably be the case that the latter two options will be right for some Labour MP’s and simply hanging in to be de selected will be right for the others, whilst hoping the momentum of Momentum declines.\n06.07.16 After Chilcot: Why not crowd fund a case of non targeted misfeasance in a public office against Blair. Or has the time it has taken to publish the report rendered action “out of time”. V2\nWell why not have a look into it. A war criminal he may not strictly speaking be, but a misfeasor he might just be. And he has the wealth to enable him to pay damages to those for whom his war has caused the greatest financial and emotional damage. The Chilcot decision swerves the necessary criticism which may turbo charge a allegation such as a claim of Blair ill motivation or lying. However he was reckless, exaggerated the case for war and had an obvious awareness of the weakness of the case advanced for embarking on war. These issues are the meat and drink of non targeted misfeasance. Once the lawyers for the families have picked over Chilcot it will be interesting to see if they agree with us.\n09.07.16 The post Brexit landscape cries out for a Capability Brown but how revolutionary dare they be?\nWe have explored the issue of the long term decline of the west caused by “secular westernism” and the culture of confidence based “free market” economics managed through a Bureaucratic system of government manipulation that has as its aim and intent maintaining “aggregate demand”. Aggregate demand is the blood that runs through the veins of the modern “free market” and along with the commodification of everything gives secular westernism its unique if alienating immoral culture. Western Christian values don’t really get a look in when every one wants to be a Rock (or porn) star.\nBrexit gives the UK an opportunity to help kick start the world economy and get the meta values of Contract Choice and Consent embedded in the world beyond the West. However some of the post election Brexiteers seem to have adopted a position of viewing post Brexit as an opportunity to spend money saved from Europe on their pet projects within the UK and this of course involves welfare. However it is welfare that needs drastic reform and whilst this cannot in the name of humanity involve overnight change there has to be a shift back towards giving Britain’s adults the right to make decisions and to take responsibility for adult activity like reproduction and health. This has to involve decisions like how fat to get and how many children to have. These two totemic issues sum up more than any other the problem faced by a government with a Bexit windfall.\nAny money saved from renegotiation cannot be wasted on the economically unproductive and their numerous welfare offspring. Welfare has infantilised too many people and continues to do so. The dysfunctional cycle of prison, welfare, babies, next lot of prison has to be broken and broken humanely. But broken it must be. Like wise the instinct to set wage levels at a level higher than is currently the case needs to be reviewed. Minimum wages and welfare policy create the context for irresponsible behaviour. Wage levels for the poorest in the UK should increase simply by limiting welfare for migrants and preventing the flow of too many unskilled workers. There doesn’t have to be a minimum wage level in the long term if the labour market is re engineered properly. This was a Blair idea to ensure that with mass EU migration wage levels didn’t hit the floor. Which without a statutory minimum they would have done.\nWage levels like much else should ideally be set by the market and not government. Wage levels should enable an individual to pay for a roof over their head, put food on the table and allow some recreation and consideration of whether the personal economic forecast would suggest children should be brought into the world. The ability to make informed decisions in respect of marriage and children is something that needs to repatriated to Britain’s adult population. Currently the decision doesn’t have to be made, as welfare and the minimum wage effectively take choice away. Hence our high divorce rate and number of “single parent” households living not on wages but benefits.\nSo our Blue Revolution “Capability Brown” should start by replanting the post war bedding plants some strong perennials that can at minimal cost to the taxpayer grow strong and survive in the new competitive global context. We don’t expect people in the rest of the world to be as morally undermined as we have become in respect of health and fertility here in the west. Their competitive edge is born by hard work and sound moral choices with low levels of government subsidy for politically expensive but socially undesirable behaviour. We quite rightly have to compete in a world where our “soft landing social context” is the biggest cost to government and therefore to our competitiveness in world markets. The adults out there will not fear this future but the other half of the country probably will.\n13.07.16 Theresa May promises a bit of a Blue Revolution. But how far will she go to re engineer the society and economy left by Blair and co?\nTony and Gordon handed on a wonky bit of economic engineering to Dave and George. We all know it as the British economy. To the casual observer it looks like it works. Money seems to come in and money seems to go out, stuff gets done. It has a deficit which the government is dealing with, whilst the newly “confident” consumer picks up the slack and keeps aggregate demand at a level that appears to keep the wheels on the economic bus. Government seems to be doing Ok so people start to borrow.\nThere is one very important factor about modern Britain however. It is debt dependent. This debt based economic model was gifted to the 2010 – 2015 coalition government by Labour and was in effect a Blair/Brown model for taking peoples debt and turning it into personal wealth for a bunch of rich cronies of whom New Labour were notoriously “casual”.\nThis is the stinking core of the Blair model and it can be seen in all its naked glory as the “Blair rich project” trundles along as Blair himself mews platitudes of self justification about his role in destroying Iraq and the lives of British servicemen and women and their families.\nThe legacy of Blair in the UK is nowhere near on par with what he has done elsewhere in the world. However the damage is noteworthy. Open boarders and a tax credit system that turbo charged migration, a welfare and economic system that promotes personal”wealth” at the expense of “social value”; generating entitlement. This economic model has created three “classes” of people all of whom Mrs May should identify and begin slowly to diminish in size. The US has a similar classes but different solutions would be needed.\nFirstly the “debt masters” or “plastic capitalists” who like the ghastly Lord Peter M of New Labour fame seek out wealth and the wealthy, acquiring wealth which in a debt model is always at someone else’s expense, a process we call debtamorphosis. There are many problems with this because essentially the model depends on debt, mass migration, escalating stock and house prices, welfare and a tolerance for general moral decline.\nThe government provide wealth to the poor in the form of benefits, and the poor buy over priced cheaply manufactured rubbish and in doing so the government’s debt quickly acquires the status of wealth for the “plastic capitalists” (Sir Phil Green anyone). It also provides tax revenue for the government.\nAs we have said before many very wealthy people succumb to the belief their wealth is value based rather than debt based. In doing so they are simply in denial. However the role of a Government with Blue Revolutionary credentials is to raise the public’s consciousness about this. The real Capitalist created value and then nicked it off the worker. The plastic capitalist simply takes other people debt as their income via consumer spending. Arguably an even more immoral system.\nSir Phillip Green is a millionaire because he could work the market to get other people to borrow so he could become rich. Boardrooms with employees on the Board might help control “Fat Cats” like Green but overturning the structures and expectations that require debt to contribute to aggregate demand has to be a twenty year government project.\nIn doing this the economy will appear to shrink but it is a necessary shrinkage. Necessary before we start to grow economic value and not simply personal wealth. The army of plastic “Capitalists” who without real capital, use the free market to extract peoples debt for personal gain has to be tackled. Mrs May needs to recognise these so called “fat cats” for what they are; parasites on the poor.\nAfter debt dependent “Fat Cats” come the legion of public sector “Fat Cats”. The “Publicsectocracy” as we call them are one of two “synthetic” engineered classes (the other being the underclass). Basically “synthetic” classes are those which have no actual link to the working of the REAL economy. They are engineered simply by government spending recklessly.\nThe economy creates government money via taxation, this money is augmented by debt and this is paid to Public sector “fat cats” (those on 100K +) in the form of wages. The creation of public sector fat cats comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about who controls the fruits of the real economy; such as those fruits are these days.\nThe Publicsectocracy sees the fruits of the economy and the debt created by government as theirs to spend on themselves whilst trying to achieve socially desirable outcomes. The reason that most public sector “fat cats” don’t reform the top end of the public sector is simple; why should they. A Chief Constable in every county! now with a Police and Crime Commissioner in every county just adds up to needless cost to the taxpayer but a great income for those in these posts. This is replicated in every Government and Local Government office throughout the public sector. How do we pay for them all?\nMrs May needs to recognise the self promoting power of the publicsectocracy. Change needs to come in both scale and salary of those at the top. No one public sector worker should earn more than the Prime Minister. We call the process of culling these top wages “rescaling” the Public Sector. Here is a paradox…in every department of the public sector social value is contributed be it policing, providing housing, working with prisoners, or abused children or maintaining a local park. The maximum social value is added at the bottom of the organisation but as the “value added” goes down (as one goes up the hierarchy) wages go up. The top executives are essentially over paid figureheads who are paid to take a responsibility for delivery of a service they can’t and don’t have the skills to deliver themselves. The publicsectocracy needs to be brought to heel and that includes the top lawyers, Judges and medics. Let them go abroad if they want to!\nFinally the most ulnerable group who need massive reform. They are are again “synthetic” in that this class, like the publicsectocracy, is created not by the economy but by government policy. They are the underclass. This class of the unemployable, the misfits, the intemperate, and stupid add so little to the positive experience of daily life as to be seen as a burden on society by everyone except the hard left who with characteristic ignorance confuse them with the “working class”. The underclass are interesting as a “synthetic” class (much more interesting than the “publicsectocracy” as they don’t even maintain the pretence of wanting to add social or even economic value to society. Karl Marx would have found this class baffling, living on the value created by others, like an aristocracy but ignorant and uncouth.\nNow it is important to be clear the underclass or not the unemployed or disabled. The disabled and unemployed however may have members of the underclass within their ranks. The underclass like all proper classes have a set of values which define them. In the case of the underclass it is idleness, ignorance and a propensity to artificially move up Maslow’s hierarchy at someone else’s expense. This is the class that spawns the Jihadi both here and on the continent. This is the class that has welfare babies creating women who are not workers but wards of the state. These people reproduce but produce no value either social or economic.\nSocial value is the key to the future. If Mrs May can get the “publicsectocracy” on the back foot then more socially useful work can be transferred to the community. Unemployed people can make a positive social contribution by caring for others and promoting positive social health. Proper communities bringing kids up properly and looking after their old and infirm. In doing this the two synthetic classes will be put under existential threat and in 100 years from now that will be a cause of great celebration. Trust us!!\n19.07.16 America and its “gun culture”. Can we at a Blue Revolution offer some advice?\nAmerica. A strange yet familiar culture to those of us in the Anglo sphere. Strange even to many Americans. Until a few years ago it electrocuted its murderers, mainly black. America drove infeasibly naff cars, to feed its working classes, again mainly black, it created a working class diet based on corn syrup and fat. It spent its government money not on welfare but on arms and warfare. It created the post capitalist “free market” which, with bankers and assorted hangers on, turned an economic system based on value to one based on wealth; and wealth flows so easily to the unscrupulous, whereas value is so much more difficult to create.\nAmerica had its origins in a combination of Puritanism and survivalism. An odd combination given that Puritanism is inherently conservative and survival depends on a ruthless pragmatism. The Puritanism defined the economic culture. The ruthless pragmatism would have been applied on a continental scale to preserve the Puritanism. Hence Article two “the right to bear arms”. Every man, and we are sure many women, were part of a culturally homogeneous militia albeit one that was not racially equal.\nIf we look at what differentiates the UK from the US, it is that the UK’s existential crisis spanned hundreds of years, hundreds of years ago. Also the UK had a feudal system which was based on “natural authority” which prevented “Citizen militias”.\nThe industrial scale manufacture of weapons came at a time when the UK population had little need to protect its culture and land mass; it was safe and well embedded. However mass production of weapons occurred at a time when America did need to protect its self and its culture and every man was therefore part of a grand militia with a right to bear arms. All within a nascent democracy giving further legitimacy to mass gun ownership.\nThe need to widely disseminate arms was paramount in the USA’s past. The need to preserve culture and protect land from an existential threat has however diminished over time. The US is unassailable to external force now. The risk comes not from without but from within. The culture of freely available arms, and the urge to protect this culture has unsurprisingly in the absence of a shared set of universal values become degraded to the point where every lifestyle difference of approach can be categorised in the minds of too many as an existential threat. Not an existential threat to the nation but to the individual….unfortunately in too many cases the armed individual.\nThe secular western culture of “we make it up as you go along” has stripped America of its shared values and widely available guns have made the streets essentially a cultural and economic battleground. Within this context the government too is seen as an existential threat to too many Americans. As a result they are shooting each other. And worse the police have become identified with the “state” shooting the nations black minorities. The whole thing is likely to go up in flames.\nSo the advice. The NRA are seriously misguided if they think that American gun ownership is protecting a shared Anglo Saxon Culture. Gun ownership isn’t protecting anything and never will again. The NRA needs to stop promoting gun ownership as though there was still something universal to protect by some kind of culturally and racially homogenous militia.\nThe State and particularly the Federal Government is no more or less legitimate to many Americans than their own cultural opinions or preferences be they racial religious or secular. So the state should stop arming those who deal with the public as though the armed public servant is protecting a vulnerable political system. Arms should be removed from public display by public officers. The public and the Government should perceive themselves as having equal power, as in a democracy they should have.\nFinally the possession of weapons should be seen as a public health issue and those who feel the need to arm themselves for reasons other than Sport or agriculture should be seen as people who have a vulnerability that cannot and should not be compensated for by firepower.\n19.07.16 Clinton and Trump. On the face of it both very different, but in reality Trump is only different because he is a big mouth\nI think someone has written about the western economic paradigm on the a Blue Revolution website a little while ago. The theme was that nothing will change much in the secular western world because western politicians are enthralled by the need to create “wealth” by all and any means possible. All this whilst ignoring difficult places where there is untapped value, mainly dangerous countries with underdeveloped social and political systems.\nThe secular western world has become dependent on wealth as opposed to value creation at every social level. Whether the worker is public sector or working in the private sector, having high personal aggregate demand is essential to maintain lifestyles of choice. The government fearful of loosing votes indulges the public’s appetite for money and uses the upward volatility of property and stock values to generate debt based wealth. This is combined with government borrowing and welfare spending keeps the economic show on the road.\nIn the U.S. it is little different but not significantly so. Clinton is a government debt master or mistress; someone who is prepared to borrow and spend to maintain aggregate demand in the misguided belief that this is good for the economy. This policy can be toyed with because interest rates are low….too low to worry about. Likewise people borrow too and pump this leveraged liquidity into the consumer economy. The debt masters in the U.K. stretch back to Brown and Blair and their heirs apparent Cameron and the financial wizard Osborn. This secular western paradigm is dangerous in the long term. But Trump is different right?\nWell Trump talks about “The American Dream”. The American dream was essentially Christian culture using the transformative power of Capitalism to drive out, through sheer productive capacity, the benign tribalism of the indigenous Indians. The “American dream” was a phase of history that took under productive land and people a created a dynamic culture based on Contract, Choice and Consent.\nTrump talks about this “dream”but has little idea of what underpins it and therefore out of ignorance transforms what he believes it is, ie making money, into a showy form of prejudice against “non Americans”. To a pouting infant like Trump the American dream is simply being proud of America and being cash rich. The American’s lap it up and who can blame them. However Trump is a property man. A Debt Master himself. Property is the engine of the debt based western economy. So whilst Trump talks up America, his economic model (if indeed he can actually articulate such a thing) is simply to use higher property and stock values to leverage debt into the consumer economy. Osborne did it in the UK. The formula is simple. Talk up the economy to create “consumer confidence” sit back and wait for the personal leveraging to start and then add government borrowing too. The house price and stock inflation keeps the illusion going that there are reasons to be confident.\nIn the UK Osborn’s case his total hysteria about Brexit highlighted just how dependent his model was on confidence based debt. Trump will adopt the same strategy; because he has no idea what he is doing. With Clinton you will get a considered policy of government borrowing and spending on welfare or “investment” with the cost borne by the poor taxpayer and the consequence a bigger state. With Trump the newly confident poor will borrow their own money for their own spending as Trump and his consumer “free marketers” laugh all the way to the bank.\nWhat unites these two “Presidential” candidates is their morally bankrupt and socially corrosive debt based economic model. What makes them different is Trump has a big mouth.\n19.07.16 When will the liberal elite, particularly the left wing liberal elite, realise that “Education, Education,Education” won’t tackle Islam’s core values…….. and why should it. V2\nThere is something very frustrating about listening to the left wing trying to square the many circles that the real world throws up when the real world contrasts itself with the limitless naivety of their social hand wringing and economically illiterate perspectives. They don’t get confused themselves of course, they can mouth political platitudes like seasoned pro’s. They just confuse, frustrate and bore everyone else. Nothing illustrates their brain exploding confusion more than the interface between their liberal views and their promotion of minority values…..all minority views even regressive ones, particularly if the view can be linked to an anti capitalist ideology such as Islamism.\nWhether the “left winger” or as Marx would have called them “vulgar socialists” are hard left or from the social democratic wing they can’t accept that simple Islam is an intractable creed that has a number of illiberal characteristics such as it is essentially obsessed with sexuality and gender roles, and is based on male authority and submission to God. If the Church of England promoted a set of ideas like this it would be the butt of jokes on every broadcast media from the BBC to Channel 4. The poor sod who expressed the belief that being Gay might not be a lifestyle choice supported by scripture would be demolished personally and probably professionally by the left wing media.\nIn the case of the the left wing however they don’t understand Islamisms power of inter generational cultural purity and its contrast with what the devout see as the cultural slop of secular western culture with its obsessions on err………….well gender, sexuality and an enforced submission to the notion of equality and freedom at all cost.\nThe depth of these differences cannot be overcome by promoting a process of re education as left wing liberals think. This is patronising and has the effect of reminding the devout people of the Islamic faith that western culture is not one that provides the certainty and clarity of lifestyle that their simple expectations require. Education, education education or E3 is unlikely to heal the wounds between Islam and the west.\nSo why won’t E3 work? well people who “learn” do so because they have common reference points. The women who fought for the vote in the 19oo’s understood Choice and Consent because their husbands enjoyed it and to some extent they encountered it too. They simply wanted more of it. When you take a person who believes in male authority and has a family that believes the same and it is believed intergenerationally, it is unlikely to change because some well meaning left winger tells them there is a different way…..a way no more than 50 years old and not based on the Koran but on a creed of free market consumerism which not only allows but encourages all kinds of frightful personal behaviour.\nIf we want to stop being targeted by Islamists we need to first define the decent values we want to promote and change the delinquent behaviours that alienate us from people of faith….all faiths…….. and none.\n28.07.19 Is the role of Housing the same under”Capitalism” as it is in the secular western “free market”…we examine the issue.\nHousing and “Capitalism”! Isn’t “Capitalism” the same as the “free market” and if not why not?\nDoes this differentiation apply outside the UK and US?\nThe housing sector is a very politicized sector with builders being driven by shareholder value whilst the many social housing providers are largely influenced by the demands of “social justice” and the left wing requirement to build homes at any cost as a way of demonstrating a commitment to the poor. Not the economy…but the poor. This “any cost” includes food security and the greenbelt. Private landlords seem to occupy everywhere from a shadowy world of rogue landlords to the high end rental sector. The small private operator clearly didn’t impress George Osborn so he legislated against the sector that has flexibility across a range of tenures, costs and locations. Regulation yes undermining the sector nowe believe.\nSo what is the answer to our complicated question? Well in classical economics and indeed Marxism the housing sector reflected at various levels (class levels) the amount of economic value that was secured by the various classes. So at the lower end the small tenement was squalid and cheap and reflected the fact that the “free” to contract proletarian was paid a meagre share of the value created by him. The rest of the value was appropriated by the capitalist who employed him. His low wage could only pay for a poor quality home so the Christian reformers began to develop decent homes; some linked to employment (Cadbury, Rowntree) others just decent homes (Peabody). The mechanism was clearly redistributive undermining how the capitalist market place (the precursor of the free market) would operate to undermine the interests of the weaker worker against the Capitalist. Evenn if some Capitalists like Cadbury willingly redistributed some of their wealth via decent homes for workers.\nWithin the model above there was however real economic “value”. The economy was value based, profitable and so the redistribution of this value constituted a cost to the capitalist. Now if wages went up (not flat lined by migration) the homes got better and more plentiful. The market operated well with a modest amount of “engineering”from the pioneers of “social housing”. They led the way in decent homes standards.\nAfter 1945 and in the UK with the welfare state altering the economy, things began to change and to compensate for western economic decline within the “Capitalist” model, the “free market” on both sides of the Atlantic evolved, shifting the housing market from being a function of the labour market to being a major constituent of the actual economy itself (remember the 2008 crash).\nThis reliance on housing being a major component of the so called “real economy”seems to us to be why Wizard Osborn wanted to “create” a vibrant private sector housing market with numerous owner occupiers. Via the process we call debtamorphosis the worker became the slave of the debt masters of the “free market”. Poor people fleeced by a government led drive to get them into debt……including housing debt. No where is this better illustrated than student debt.\n“So”……as they say too often today; what should we be doing about all this. Firstly the economy might appear to grow with owner occupation as a sizeable proportion of the housing market, but it is just an illusion based on debt. Within an open economy “debt” doesn’t do what it does in a closed economy….it doesn’t drive value it drives consumption. The housing market undermines the real economy, in our view it creates an asymmetrical economy where people are housed in the wrong place and locked into housing they rely on to supplement their income. It also encourages social and community decline. And let us not forget it is all debt based.\nThe solution is to recognise that housing is and always should be a function of the economy, not a driver of the economy as it is now. So via public housing projects house people in decent homes that are a social asset which are never bastardised to become the financial prop for an enfeebled and misfiring “free market” economy. There will always be a private sector housing market but to stop it being used to support aggregate demand in the wider economy it needs to be counter balanced with a social housing market which actually houses the workers and can move them to where they are needed. Revolutionary indeed!\nFinally is this debt based housing model the same outside the UK and US ? It depends on the economy’s exposure to “owner occupation” and that is determined by how much debt is needed within the economy to support “aggregate demand”and how willing the government is to expose the workers to debt in a desperate bid to “grow” the economy via their home ownership.\n29.07.16 How popular would a blue collar revolution be if it peddled back from a world of debt based immorality and, well……debt. And how could it be done?\nWe hope we have covered what a “Blue Revolution” might look like in the various posts we have made over the last 18 months. We hope anyone reading our posts will get a sense of what we believe and why. If not we are going to try to spend the next six months creating a “Manifesto” for “Blue Revolutionary change”. We are not politicians and don’t want to be. We are interested in ecology, business and economics, politics, psychology and society….in short we are interested in planet earth and its people.\nHowever we believe that just as George Osborn and David Cameron were seduced into adopting the theology of “secular westernism” (the promotion and extension of a debt based, “free market” first developed as Reganomics and Thatcherism but then turbo charged by the slippery Clinton, Blair, Bush Troika) so many of us are benign fellow travellers.\nToo many of us buy into this “theology” of “secular westernism”, laughably the only opposition until recently came from the rather stupid “left wing” who neither understand the nature of the current system (i.e. their solution more debt please to “cure” austerity, oh a bit more government too just to add to the sense of achieving some kind of historical destiny for the masses).\nIn the US Trump and Clinton are both “secular westerners” but one is an intelligent woman the other an oaf. In the UK Theresa May could be the first to challenge the secular western theology with her more “blue collar” cabinet; but it is early days. We believe destiny is knocking on the front door but most people and most politicians are still answering the back door.\nWhat we are encouraged to believe about our culture, we believe, is all total nonsense, whether it is “Remain” as in the EU or “austerity” is class war, or “our way of life” delivers “justice” freedom, democracy and opportunity, or diversity is a benign cultural relativism as opposed to bone headed idiocy fuelling violence in the absence of any form of unifying philosophy based on economics.\nIt seems to us only a Blue Revolution’s collection contributing “workers” can “raise consciousness” in a truly Marxist sense. Hopefully more people will realise that saving the planet, saving our lives and liberties and yes saving the whale, is all down to people adopting the mindset of “A Blue Revolutionary”.\nWith a Blue Revolution there is no club to join, no badge to wear and no “revolutionary vanguard” so beloved of the hard and implacable left; just things to think about, reflect upon and try and assimilate into our own lives based on how each of us experiences our life in the early 21st century.\nAs with all Manifesto’s we will look at various themes. The next one will be “Tackling Debt”. Chapter 1.\n04.08.16 The problem of debt and how our collective love of consumption makes us all the puppets of the global debt meisters V3\nThis is the key to all the western world’s ills. It is something which enslaves us, sets generation against generation makes relationships either fragile of immoral and turns the wheels of “debtamorphosis”; a western banking and governmental process which turns indebtedness into wealth for those who are lucky enough to be the card sharks of the “free market”. These people along with the bankers and the Barons of the publicsectocracy do very nicely at the expense of the poor, the young and the general taxpayer. How has this happened?\nWell if you imagine a see saw 200 years long with a man with a stove pipe hat on one end of the see saw and he has his end on the ground we can call this end “value” and the other end “debt”. We can imagine that as we move from one end of the two hundred year long see saw to the other the balance shifts between “value” and “debt”. After two hundred years the man in the stove piped hat is replaced by a public servant who has his wages paid by government debt.\nAlong with the publicsectocracy we have the mass ranks of debt masters who either create debt or who benefit from debt. The super profits of the supermarkets, the corporations and banks all rely on debt, inflating domestic aggregate demand. It is aggregate demand which keeps profits up, people in a trance like state buying “stuff”, oh, and tax for governments keen to get re elected. Keeping this process going requires a couple of things; it requires increasing asset values (like housing and stock values) as this becomes the basis of lending against the debt.\nAll this is what passes as economic value but of course as 2008 showed us…..it isn’t economic value at all, it is government and societies debt. The whole process is utterly without foundation but economists still talk as though it is somehow “real”. The rubbish spoken by Mark Carney and George Osborne and some economists at the BBC (some have now left thankfully) is simply rehearsing a language based on an economic and social orthodoxy which has no actual value underpinning it.\nin many ways is like making up a language which doesn’t apply to the real world. Or at least changes the meaning of the words. It is a world of borrowing being “investment”, tax no longer being “value” wealth similarly, and debt being the basis for wealth and taxation. The whole system is based on “consumer confidence” in otherwords the whole thing is based on the public’s confidence the system will perpetuate itself. It is kept “real” simply on the basis of this “consumer confidence”; the confidence to borrow, and spend and tax and spend.\nThis debt makes people crave “things” rather than relationships. Everything becomes tradable and this too feeds the free market debt monster. With wealth the consumers main driver rather than social and economic value one family can a morally become two families, two families need two TV’s and the money tied up in the owner occupied family home becomes cashable to sweeten the divorce and provide some much needed aggregate demand to drive further consumption; oh and there is a need for an extra house just to help the house builder and the governments coffers too.\nThe winners are the rich and the publicsectocracy. The losers are the poor and the planet. We said that a Blue Revolution helps to save the whale…well debt is how the current system undermines the planet by driving unsustainable consumption and therefore its damages ecological structures and environments. This includes our living environment both social and economic.\nThe solution to this monster will be time consuming (no pun intended)….well the see saw is two hundred years long; but we can start to shuffle towards the pivot if we firstly accept that we are not living in a world of value but debt and anti austerity is really about more debt.\nRather than thinking that government taxation is taking real value off real capitalists who in the past would have “misappropriated” it from the workers; the capitalist no longer really exist and neither does the value capitalists used to create……at least not in the west. Today we have debtmasters and the wealthy who together manipulate the leavers of the markets to ensure that as much of the debt we and governments create ends up in the hands of the government elite and the wealthy bankers and business persons like the fat peasant Phil Green.\nMarx would have failed to understand this system, he was a classical economist at heart…….so it is odd that the left still hold to the old socialist methods of tackling the problem namely tax and spend. The British left are publicsectorcrats before they are representatives of the workers. Hence the reason they are f****d. More of this later when we consider “Labour isn’t working because “socialism” no longer works; we explain why”………as a service to Corbyn and Smith.\n10.08.16 Why do the left in the UK think their every utterance is “progressive” when in most regards the opposite is actually the case? We consider Grammar schools.\nHere at a Blue revolution we are a mixed bag, some “passed” the 11+ and some “failed”. Some never took it! As we have said before therein lies the problem with promoting selective education. It is seen as better and fairer not to have been tested than to have failed. However, we take a “progressive” view which we believe puts the solid old left ideas about selection into the 20th-century dustbin.\nFirstly the promoters of selection need to stop presenting the 11+ as some kind of test of intelligence and see it more like a psychometric test; a test of aptitude for a certain way of learning. The fact it is seen to be based on intelligence creates for the virtue warriors of the left the obvious link with elitism assisting those who are advantaged by their class.\nIf the test was rigorous, based on maths, and spelling (technical skills) and taken at the age of 13 on an opt-in basis it would be less a stigma not to be identified as non-academic”. The 11 plus is obscure and alienates the very people it should be motivating. It does this by being unrelated to the real world of academic study. It was intended to do this to keep those passing it as exclusive or elite as possible. But in doing this it excludes the children of the workers.\nIt would become by a child’s thirteenth birthday relevant for a small group of children (school or parental referred) within any county or group of counties who maintain a school fully state funded for this very skilled group of young students. If the bar was set high it would escape the claim that the levels of aptitude within the top to middle of the selected sector and non-selected are too similar to justify grammar school selection. The state would bear the cost of such schools where the “students with aptitude” numbers justified it.\nThe second issue is that of class. The old left talk as though a local bank manager, self-employed plumber, the owner of an electricians business or a doctor are upper class. They are not; they are working and earning a living; the fact that they are not part of the left wings new constituency of choice; the underclass, does not make them part of the hated bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie were capitalists not workers regardless of how well paid those workers might be. By keeping the children of ordinary people away from a grammar school education means there is an open goal for the public schools to snaffle the better-paid jobs and stop social mobility in its tracks.\nFinally something “socialist” from the Blue Revolutionaries. Life is about acceptance and not about chips on shoulders. For every John Prescott, there are people without chips on their shoulders who went on to achieve a position in life they were happy with. Lord Prescott is an exemplar of how failing the 11+ isn’t life destroying. However, it will lead to many young people taking the view that they would rather lorry drive or hair dress and save themselves the cost of a university education before errr…….lorry driving or hairdressing.\nWhilst the original reason we believe the grammar schools were scrapped was because public schools were being undermined and the old establishment felt threatened so the bogus claim of “equality for all” was used to preserve privilege for those able to pay for a private education so the current obsession with making all children “academic” even when they are not is we believe about preserving the “academic left” in “their” places of learning. In both cases, children are used ideologically and it is the “masses” and their children who suffer.\nOne final point is about cooperation. No one is an island and there is, in these less “class” obsessed times, more desire to work collaboratively to achieve team and group goals rather than being a battle of class against class. This class war is a 20th-century phenomenon wonderfully captured in the labour relations film comedies of the post-war era . So for every person who is highly academic (and the economy doesn’t need that many of these highly academic types) there will be an army of people upon whom these academic types will come to depend.\nThe next post will look at the “household” as one limb of the western world’s slow recovery.\nNB less class obsessed of course unless you are a left winger for whom class is an issue of existential relevance as well as self-preservation\n13.08.16 Labour isn’t working because “socialism” no longer works. If you still don’t understand why, read on…..V5\nUnfortunately, we have to start with Tony Blair and his cronies who believed that there was nothing wrong with getting “filthy rich”. Again unfortunately, Blair and Bill Clinton’s “third way” was a means by which the workers were exploited in a different way from the “misappropriation” of value to maximize profits under the old largely defunct “capitalist” system. The currency of modern “wealth” is debt not old fashioned value. In classical terms and Marxism, value is different from both profit and price and therefore wealth. We don’t need to concern ourselves with these distinctions here.\nThe capitalist system started to collapse in the west about eighty years ago being replaced by what we at a Blue Revolution call “secular westernism”; the amoral evolution of the “free market”. Secular westernism is even more immoral than “capitalism” as it requires the worker to be a provider of debt to maintain aggregate demand, with the government as the borrower of last resort using its debt and taxation for the same basic purpose.\nThe government also has the job of maintaining “consumer confidence”. This is simply the belief that borrowing and spending can continue into the future and therefore people will continue in jobs and be able to borrow and spend. personal borrowing also includes the most damaging form of indebtedness; student debt.\nThe Cameron Government’s fear of a drop in consumer confidence was clearly in evidence during the “Brexit” referendum with the Wizard of Osborn becoming more and more shrill as the prospect of Brexit became a possibility. For Osborn Brexit would have a damaging effect on “Consumer Confidence”. The fact the EU and the secular western economies globally, are utterly without sound economic foundations was either not recognised or ignored. “Confidence” was all and is all that matters.\nAs long as secular westernism continues to strive to create “confidence” based debt, which becomes, debt based wealth for the publicsectorcrats (the upper reaches of the Public Sector) and the other winners of the “free market”, everyone should be “happy”.\nSo from Thatcher to Osborn (Son’s of Thatcher to Heirs to Blair) the debt-reliant economic system was created and has evolved. With the systems ability to maintain debt and “consumer Confidence” we all continue to spend and borrow. The process creates immoral behaviour; on a structural level by Banks and at a personal level by people having for example children they could never hope to raise without government subsidy, or cashing in housing equity to pay for divorce. The role of the family is diminished as government steps in, to paper over the social cracks created by a bankrupt “real economy”.\nSocialism’s most dangerous tactic is to promote the idea that the government and its bureaucracy is a substitute for a properly functioning social and economic system. The legacy when failure comes will be to “progress us” back to the dark ages and woe betide a range of currently legitimate lifestyle choices when that happens. Gay people, feminists, and a plethora of others who have rights to contract choose and consent to lifestyles choices now, will be unprotected when the state will to too broke to protect them in the future even if ….and it’s a big if, it wanted to. This war of attrition on Contract Choice and Consent is being rehearsed in Europe by the bum fluff sporting disciples of ISIS. Contract Choice and Consent is what they hate…….as do strident socialists. Corbyn in particular is reckless with the three C’s particularly around women’s rights and the rights of the Jewish minority in his party. The reason is, these people think they understand socialism and how it has to be delivered; but to understand socialism you MUST properly understand Capitalism and how it evolved….and they want to smash capitalism not see it evolve as it must.\nSo where does our economic critique of socialism come in. Well in the old days “socialists” recognised the “capitalist” was rendering the environment toxic with pollution and the workers lives poor, uncertain and unhealthy via low wages. The Socialist’s mission was to take the surplus value “stolen” from workers ( the capitalist’s profit) by the capitalists, and to redistribute it. In doing so rendering the environment cleaner and with welfare safer and less uncertain. This simple idea is very complex because it is prefaced on the basis that “capitalism” should and does deliver “value” and therefore there is only immorality in the Capitalist keeping the lions share of the value as profit. It also assumes there is no immorality in the socialist taking and redistributing the value.\nSo far so good…Eventually the Keys of the Capitalist machine (Contract, Choice and Consent, Land Labour and Capital) are enjoyed by the workers. By then via collaboration. The liberated and now unexploited workers continue to deliver value both social and economic and also by this time the “state has withered away” and the system is wholly collectivist. This is social collectivism as well as economic but without the government mediating. The last bit is a bit fanciful….even Marx struggled to define this period with no state and total collectivism. The period of no state is centuries away. However the “socialist” bit we can visualise as we have created it already. And there in lies the explanation of why socialism no longer works.\nThe current economy (with government costs a large burden and clearly not in any way a withered state) is now reliant on workers “Debt” not workers mis-appropriated “value”. This is not an economy that governments can morally intervene with to redistribute….because what are they redistributing exactly?\nGovernments thrive off the GDP figures which a debt based economy still obsesses about (ask yourself why construction and housing are so important to the health of our current economy). Any attempt to correct the injustice of “capitalism’s past exploitation of the workers” has no relevance today as there is no value to liberate, but any diminution in debt will damage GDP the confidence so craved by the chancellor and bankers . The debt machine must stop…….and this is seen as a bad thing!\nIf you are still with us you will recognise that the exploitation the government covertly supports is no longer by capitalist bosses taking workers surplus value, but is the exploitation is by the financial sector and state itself, encouraging the indebtedness of the government itself in tandem with the debt of the individual. Debt is morally the worst kind of exploitation if it isn’t to encourage part of a functioning mixed economy underpinning a stable and morally sustainable society.\nBasically the Anti Austerity brigade, Corbyn, Smith and the more bamboozled Tories still believe that when Governments fund themselves through tax they are legitimately re appropriating “Workers Value” on behalf of the workers, rather than doing as they unfortunately are doing, encouraging the workers to support the free market via debt based consumption, thus creating an army of the “filthy rich” so loved by Blair. This overzelous public spending is therfore debt that ends up being spent by the Government on running Government and on the pensions and welfare system containing unproductive people. It undermines not only the economy but society as well. The idea that there is anything “social” about socialism paid for by debt is laughable. But we can’t let people starve so we have to re engineer the system and do it slowly and sustainably.\nSo what do we at a Blue Revolution think the future should look like? Here are a few ideas. Ask yourself how “socialist is it”:\nClean water and air, safe homes (Private and public, owner occupied and rental), safe places to work, a reduction in “stuff” manufactured for the sake of profit based on debt (also good for the environment, less production means less emissions). A smaller state. Operational workers (in health etc) paid decently, but a massive rescaling of salaries for the people who are paid at the top to deliver nothing at the bottom. Reform of higher education to end the “jobs for Guardian readers” hegemony in higher education. A welfare system that recognises that welfare is a government transfer of cost for the unproductive individual i.e. from the worker to the non worker and theretofore lacks “natural justice” and often encourages immorality. A recognition that debt as a means of delivering wealth to sustain consumption is doomed to fail with devastating consequences when it does fail….and it will.\nReducing demand reduces stress on eco systems and the environment as well as requiring a shift towards a more sustainable economic model. This Blue economic model does not contain the myth that the government is doing good by playing God but by making the public dependent on welfare and debt it is undermining long term social survival of the positive legacy of capitalism (Contract, Choice and Consent) and also undermining its own legitimacy.\nThe challenge is; how do we achieve change? Well, we need to stop seeing “Socialism” as the answer for a start.\nIf you still don’t understand it…..you are either in thrall to the western secular paradigm or you are yet to have your consciences raised.\n18.8.16 The white boys under perform and we still have to tackle a lack of cultural integration; Blue Revolution explains why we have not improved things…..yet. V4\nAnyone who was working in the British public sector in the “Blair years” will have been exposed to an attempted brainwashing with “diversity” training. The aim was benign enough; we are all the same really. However, the model was feeble in that it didn’t empower people to challenge discrimination unless it was premised on the power imbalance between black and white. There was, therefore, an unintended boost given to those cultural simplicities that promote a range of discriminations; against women in particular but also against Jews and those of different sexualities. In Britain and within the EU people could not find it in themselves to challenge a range of actual behaviours which reflect this discrimination. A silence was believed to be the best ploy.\nHow wrong that was and unfortunately still is. Diversity was intended to promote the idea that we are all the same underneath our skin and culture, however, it overstressed the difference in a morally confused environment of hand-wringing and embarrassment. So far so bad.\nAt a Blue Revolution we believe the reason for this was our old friend the confused and morally ambiguous “western liberal culture”. This is a culture which in its economic manifestation promotes consumerism and debt (secular westernism) and therefore offers no unimpeded economic infrastructure demanding the creation of value via an economically literate, self-aware and motivated workforce. Its moral ambiguity which promotes pornography and a general disregard for the lives of vulnerable people, also allows people to become economically inactive and welfare dependent. What this means for society is that with no strong moral principles people slide to the lowest possible social and economic level.\nThe white working class find themselves in casual promiscuous relationships with the bonus of welfare babies for the girls, with the boys enjoying the toxicity of casual sex which too often becomes a preoccupation overtaking the need to earn a living. The welfare model also allows families to maintain relationships along traditional lines. The number of men of Pakistani descent driving taxis suggests that in work welfare keeps family income at a level which allows wives to remain within a traditional family structure.\nAs we have seen with the Labour party’s lamentable treatment of Asian women in places like Dewsbury there is little opportunity for women when the local culture still harbours the view that man has dominion over women. It also doesn’t help that western culture is sexually preoccupied……which it is. So with this asymmetry and a “diversity culture” of “don’t ask don’t tell” within a free market culture, there is nothing driving integration. Integration if it is going to happen needs an economic foundation. Whilst Capitalism couldn’t have offered “diversity” preferring conformity (the standardised “worker”), it did offer Contract Choice and Consent which is now under threat from diversity. Perverse but true.\nIn the pre-secular western world of “capitalism” the workers would have had to work, wages would be the only source of income and with no welfare “top ups” babies would have rightly been a financial liability for hopefully loving parents, not financial asset for the sexually reckless Within a family all of working age would have to be at work. A lack of financial security would have resulted in a levelling of rights for all. The Contract, Choice and Consent (three C’s) would have been the basis for all relationships, women, school leavers, wives, husbands, fathers and mothers. It was capitalism’s potential to underpin real integration and equality with choice and consent at least in a non-wealth sense.\nSo what is the solution? Well, here at a Blue Revolution we believe in the three C’s but don’t believe these rights can be exercised in a community motivated by debt and made fat on welfare. We believe that the economy needs to properly re-balance so that families are responsible for children up to and beyond the age of 60…..yes sixty. The “child” is no longer a homogenous “factor of production” destined for “the Pit” factory or to raise a family. This is because the social, psychological and economic environment is too complex. However, work and the social nature of people has to be promoted within a new framework which reflects the reality of a “Post-Capitalist”economy. This has to have a basis in the real economy to avoid being a sort of Corbyn utopianism. Let us take an extreme example.\nIf a child has Aspergers or autism they are diagnosed and then essentially pushed out of the working environment which is still geared for the 40-hour week worker. The same applies to the ex-offender. The opportunity to manage their lives based on a possible combination of co-operation from family and community plus employment arranged on a flexible basis is not really an option. The welfare environment does not currently reflect the desire of many people to genuinely “promote diversity”. A Diversity agenda without some kind of economic model underpinning it is just utopianism or as we call it “waffle”. Because it is just a waffle no one takes it seriously, so after twenty years of brainwashing we have no significant integration, white boys underperform, there is little cultural integration. The disabled find it hard to enter the work place and the mentally ill are sidelined by the economy but can get counselling. Offenders become a breeding nuisance.\nPeople who can’t do forty hours per week but get trapped on welfare are pushed out of the workplace. society is about as un”diverse” as it is possible to get whilst being just about able to claim it is “striving for diversity”. Yet the economy is flexible enough to offer some solutions. The answer is not simple but change is possible. We should not expect the government to determine the standards by which we live our economic and social lives. That creeping nationalisation of our lives via welfare, nieve diversity agendas, a criminal justice system that scoops people out of society, undermines all of us as individuals, families, households and communities. The government, of course, has got a role, but to comply with our three C’s it has to be more complex than delivering welfare on demand which as we have seen diminishes equality, opportunity and diminishes standards for white working class boys and Asian women. The welfare trap needs slowing down whilst people are expected to support themselves with the support of their family in the first instance. Of course, the left will claim this is socially divisive rather than socially liberating. But with people taken out of the economy by “welfare” socialism has no plan for integration other than more welfare.\nAs usual, the well-intentioned hand wringers make the problems of life for ordinary people worse by trying to get them to conform to a standard model of social existence in a consumer obsessed welfare reliant and debt dependent early 21st century, rather than letting our diverse economy shape a diverse society unimpeded.\n24.08.16 Many people think they know who is in the much derided “establishment” ….but unless you view it from a Blue Revolutionary perspective you are unlikely to see your friends amongst its ranks or indeed yourself ! V2\nOwen Jones has had a go, and with his outriders and others seemed to see almost everyone in well connected Britain falling into the establishment; except himself of course. However, the litmus test for “who is in and out” of the establishment was Brexit. There are those who are not Jones like “out-riders”, but are lower ranking “establishment figures”; those who like a modern day overlord support the power of the establishment because they gain from its patronage and protection.\nBefore embarking on our Blue Revolutionary analysis we want to make it clear that whilst the monarchy provides some of the trappings of rank for the establishment; titles, gongs etc the monarchy its self is not “establishment” at least not in Blue Revolutionary terms. This difference in opinion casts our Blue Revolution as very different from our rather eccentric, very earnest Red Revolutionary student activist cousins. For us the presence of the monarch is of little consequence to the way power is acquired, passed on and used in 21st century Great Britain. We also dismiss the “fourth” estate……perhaps with the exception of some elements of the Broadcast media as “establishment”. For us, the terms establishment and anti-establishment are about as relevant today as they would have been during and after the English Civil war. The terms could only be applied in any meaningful sense by outsiders, and just like then, today there are very few of them around. Most of us think we are one thing when perhaps we might actually be the other. How so?\nAll periods have those who have negotiated their way close to the top. The top is determined by two things; the way value is created and who it is distributed to. Those negotiating their way to the top are identified by how much of the wealth from the top they have been able to acquire for themselves. In feudal times the king distributed wealth, or the ability to gain wealth to favoured noblemen. In capitalist times exploitation was mediated by wages. Workers free to contract in a system designed to enable the capitalist to appropriate value from the workers who create it, by paying a wage much lower than the value created by the worker.\nThere is nothing immoral about this system as it is based on “consent” but the skill of the capitalist (entrepreneurialism) is rewarded more than the workers who create his profit. The king and his court, the lower ranking barons are the “establishment” in feudalism. The Sheriff is a minor functionary but still his position is made possible by the role he plays in the feudal state.\nWithin capitalism, the establishment still had to endure the presence of the old establishment (lords and the monarchy) but over time, the contractual choice based relationships in capitalism moved the old establishment away from the centre of power. The new establishment was capitalist and the branches of State such as law, the Church, education and parliament became infused with the values of this new capitalist establishment. With Contract, Choice and Consent at the core of the capitalist system liberty became a right if not exactly an achievable right. The workers were “exploited” in Marxist terms their rights were real but irrelevant due to the poverty too many of the workers experienced.\nThe capitalist establishment was unwilling to look at this issue of poverty and charities set themselves up to protect the vulnerable. Protecting young women in service from exploitation for example. Into the establishment, therefore emerged radicals. These people knew how the system worked and could see that it was unfair. The capitalist system allowed rights but for the poor, women and the disabled the rights to contract, choose and consent was limited by the lack of wealth these marginal groups had at their disposal.\nEventually, the “radicals”won the day and by 1945 the majority Labour government was able to deliver more contract, choice and consent, backed up by a fairer “distribution of wealth”. This was probably the finest hour for socialism. It needed “investment” in a bureaucracy to deliver the desired social and economic outcomes. However, the social and economic outcomes became a disease which slowly undermined the economy culminating in the winter of discontent in the 1970’s and high levels of moral decay as people gave up personal responsibility to the government. This period was the point at which the “new establishment”; the post-Capitalist establishment began to assert itself. It had an agenda to promote; itself, public sector services are based on the values the new establishment believes should be widely understood by the people.\nHowever, the values it promoted were ultimately found to be of benefit to them only. The Banking crisis was not delivered just by banks but by banks on behalf of the government. Government reliant on financial services to create debt which becomes the basis for economic confidence and “growth” via consumption. With too much debt and an “economy” based on consumption the social fabric of society disintegrates and the state has to step in, crime goes up and the state steps in. We call this theun-virtuall circle. It is all paid for by debt….the nonsense of debt being “investment” is something only socialists still believe. Debt is a burden on the public but it keeps the new establishment in place. It protects the publicsectocracy. The publicsectocracy and the banks dance a very involved tango which sees the government depending on the central banks who maintain confidence to gain greater and greater levels of indebtedness thus keeping consumption levels up. Whilst they are low ranking the universities provide establishment “cheerleaders” and lots of indebted students pay to become cheerleaders too.\nSo who are the new establishment; well the Remain group in the Brexit debate contain many of them; people who would prioritise bloated European bureaucracy and “progressive” EU law ahead of dealing with the indebtedness of the British economy are part of the establishment. They believe in their own jobs and euro jobs not the success of an independent British economy. The bankers are the money men of the new establishment and part of the new establishment itself. However, they are not the top of the tree. At the bottom of the establishment tree are public sector workers on 100K plus (Chief constables, top Civil Servants etc), “progressive left” often unionised public sector workers are the new establishments “drones” (in the bee sense!), actors who have a simpering view of the “poor” but can’t see that their wealth is illegitimate as their wages are determined by “corporations” not “consumers” but like everything else their fees or wages based on debt.\nThe top of the new establishment is tree are driven by strong but often misplaced values and a sanctimonious belief that the British people are uninformed, bigoted, and stupid. Britain needs educating to promote the correct values. The top people read the “Guardian” and are able to use law to square many of their political circles. They acquire power from the state and the law, which they use directly or indirectly to deliver laws which protect their interests. This all too often means “protecting” people but also institutions. The Courts are part of the new establishment, delivering via the Human Rights Act case outcomes which promote the interests of the new establishment their allies and apologists. Politics, law and medicine are three pillars of the “new establishment”, however, if there is one group who can rally be said to “top off” the ” new establishment it is …….\n……….ladies and gentlemen, liberal lawyers and in particular those who are also politicians. Politicians are still top of the power tree. These politician lawyers use the law to manipulate the state and promote their own self-interest and the interests of their fellow travellers. This explains the relationship between the banks, the rich and New Labour and Cameron Tories. The new establishment is however under threat from an even newer emerging blue-collar establishment; the political representatives of the people; Nigel Farage, Theresa May, Liam Fox, David Davis and Boris Johnson politicians who the people are able to trust in the main (at least for now) as they so obviously have no links to “the new establishment”. Corbyn, Saunders and Trump gain support for being anti-establishment but only Saunders really is a political outsider, the other two……..Enough said.\nThe “old new establishment” The “heirs to Blair and Blair himself are a risk to Contract, Choice and Consent and are a risk to the British people because they don’t like what British people believe and see the views of the British people as a threat to their “progressive values”. Their values simply promote their interests. If Contract Choice and Consent don’t deliver their view of progress, like a Remain outcome…then ignore the outcome. Democracy indeed! more like a Platonic rule by Guardians….Cheri and Tony, Bill and Hilary anyone……No thought not.\nWith Brexit the old new establishment has had its nose rubbed in it and for most of us, it looks and feels great. Now it is time for the people, the masses, who generate social and economic value to drive politicians away from their obsession with creating wealth for the few within a “progressive” administrative culture that traps people in poverty, undermines real equality and promotes perhaps unintentionally “immoral outcomes”. All people need to start to think about how they can create economic and social value for the many…….a blue revolution.\n25.08.16 A Clinton or Trump Presidency is an opportunity for Britain post Brexit.\nTrump offers comic stupidity and has his wall sending his message to a largely politically illiterate but rightly angry constituency of blue collar workers. Clinton offers dull conformity with the prevailing orthodoxy of debtamorphosis. This requires the workers to accept government and personal indebtedness to keep the levers and buttons of the state and economy turning. The purpose; to enable the state to continue employing well-heeled Oxbridge or Ivy league graduates from a certain class background to “run” things. All this whilst pretending it is really all about maintaining aggregate demand and “consumer confidence”.\nThis flawed model is going to tip the western economies over the edge sometime around 2025. But by then Clinton, the likely presidential winner, will be out of office with a pile of debt based wealth in her personal bank account and chaos on America and Europe’s streets. Having paid its debtamorphosis to the wealthy, they will walk away and leave the chaos to the poor. The “progressive” left consensus will have endowed the Blairs and Clintons with unfathomable wealth as we all struggle to survive in a society of little or no social or economic value. Gosh it sounds horrifying but the west is beyond the thin end of the wedge; just look at the state of family life (social value) and the reliance on debt as the real productive economy declines is significance.\nClintons adherence to this “progressive” model in the US is almost certain. This “progressive” economic model is or was the model that underpinned the EU and with the UK sensibly getting out there is an opportunity for an alternative model to be offered and the trickery of the current model to be exposed. With Osborn and Cameron no longer in office, Theresa May can look at scaling back debt, expose the con trick of debtamorphosis inherent within “anti-austerity ” claptrap of the “left” and its fans and beneficiaries. She can rebalance the British economy in favour of production instead of debt, get unskilled work back in the hands of unskilled British workers, whilst at the same time promote a fair but selective education system which will hopefully get the children of blue collar and lower managerial workers into the establishment where the expectations of ordinary people will become better understood.\nAllied to these domestic changes, the possibility exists for Britain to offer a social and economic model to the world as with Clinton and Trump there is an absence of global leadership and a lack of a new but realistic global vision. We can aspire to create a world that can trade widely on the basis Contract, Choice, and Consent. With scaled back welfare underpinning the economic model we can incentivise work, free movement can be liberalised to those who want to come and work , taxes can be reduced and what is left of the social fabric of the country used to rebuild family life as the state is no substitute for the family and community. The world needs a moral revolution and Britain is well placed to lead the way.\n28.08.16 The point about HS2 is that no one can really remember the point. We offer some guidance for those who want it.\nHS2 belongs to an age oh about ten years ago when “major infrastructure projects” were seen as the salvation of the economy by New Labour. There were two basic reasons; they were seen as a good in themselves in the case of HS2 trimming twenty minutes off a journey time to London, but most importantly they were seen as a way of pumping money into the economy via wages and the purchase of raw materials. This is neo-Keynesianism and of course, it doesn’t work. It doesn’t work because the world economy is open and thus money is not really “invested” it is borrowed and “spent” on vanity projects like HS2 and the wages paid contribute to immediate consumption. Much of this consumption is often “off- shored” or spent on foreign goods and holidays. And it is of course raised from the indebtedness of the British people. So it won’t have the “multiplier” effect it would have had in post-war Britain when there were limits on how much currency you could take out of the country.\nGiven the fact that the contractors moreover are often not British the advantages to the economy are limited to the final outcome of the infrastructure project itself. In the case of HS2 this will be to draw people to London by train with a saving of twenty minutes and a subsidised cost for that twenty minutes saving of goodness knows how much. The government will have ratcheted up debt and the money spent will achieve little more than maintaining immediate consumption for those undertaking the job of building HS2.\nIt fails the economic necessity over cost and long-term economic impact test. Basically, we think it is a waste of money.\n30.08.16 The legacy of the Blair years the “third way” a combination of socialism and greed. Lets look at who has their snout in the trough.\nSocialism, as we have explained before, is a product of advanced capitalism. The capitalist system offers important rights to all people ( we summarise them as Contract, Choice and Consent), however, only the capitalist and the wealth remnants of the feudal age, the aristocracy, enjoyed them to their full extent. Socialism was the result. It was a grass-roots movement by workers and more progressive bourgeoisie to deal with the of the imbalances within capitalism. Many 19th century capitalists were benign but the system created insecurity and uncertainty for workers. It was not a benign system. However much to the fury of modern “progressives” it worked. It created value, social and economic and it put bread on the table for the vast majority of western workers. It was the value capitalism created that formed the basis for socialism’s initial programme of reform and redistribution. In the UK this happened after the last war. In the US and over the same time-scale it was a martial plan; “welfare” for taking up arms on behalf of the state and going into foreign theatres of war. The governments in both countries began to acquire the nation’s productive value to pursue its political objectives.\nIn Britain, the lack of aspiration following on from the lack of Contract, Choice and Consent was an early target of the new socialist government. Mistakes on the way included wrongly ascribing fostering inequality to the Grammar schools, undermining the stability of the family with welfare, and driving enterprise and industry out of the country whilst promoting the acquisition of wealth which is devoid of actual value. We call this debtamorphosis; the process by which government or a consumer’s debt becomes someone’s wealth.\nBy the early 1990’s the “yellow brick road” of wealth acquisition was beguiling governments and those who would aspire to be wealthy. Businesses were manufacturing abroad and selling here at prices that got the consumer into debt but made the “business man” very rich. Shopping Centres or Malls were springing up and work was becoming minimum wage and unskilled. This wealth was important to Governments as they have spending commitments and needed to tax it. However, it was also important for the wealthy to overlook the debt based origins of their wealth, and try and avoid paying tax on it. It is staggering to think that you make more profit selling something than you make producing it. But that is the nature of the global economy. This system was largely created by the free marketeers of the Thatcher-Regan era. However, we don’t believe the full implications of this system were fully understood.\nThis wealth created by the economy was important to Governments as they have spending commitments and needed to tax it. However, it was also important for the wealthy to overlook the debt based origins of their wealth, and try and avoid paying tax on it. It is staggering to think that you make more profit selling something than you make producing it. But that is the nature of the global economy. This system was largely created by the free marketeers of the Thatcher-Regan era. However, we don’t believe the full implications of this system were fully understood.\nAs we said there was a drift into low wage employment, value creating jobs were disappearing in favour of service jobs, but along with the value creating jobs mainly in manufacturing, “organised labour” was being pushed out too. Life for workers was getting uncertain again. But the workers themselves didn’t help. The 1970’s confirmed that when bosses and workers stop thinking about the product and go into battle over wages the economy and individuals suffer. For a Blue Revolution, the greatest tragedy was the appalling industrial relations of the 1970’s and the pointless battles between workers and bosses that destroyed the economy. Had the workers known that manufacturing could be outsourced to China would they have been so stupid and to destroy their jobs and industries. If they known their jobs would be replaced by jobs dependent on debt, would they have been so keen to see their industries collapse; had the government realised that people were getting rich…..stupidly rich, creating nothing much at all…selling sort of cheap “stuff”, would they have tolerated this Alice in wonderland world and, more importantly, would they have relied on it for tax revenue to pay for their social and economic vanity projects.\nWell, of course they would, because by the late 1990’s Blair and co saw the money this model was delivering into the economy and were “casual” about people being rich because they had no idea how the money was created. Their economic illiteracy, however, was compounded by an old socialist agenda of wealth redistribution, and a desire to “socially engineer”a better society. Any student of Karl Marx would have known that social progress was a function of the economy, and regulated capitalism had done a reasonable job to date ( we accept not perfect) providing freedom based on work rather than race, gender or any other “improper” basis to use current parlance. However, to Blair and Co, the wealth of tycoons like Phillip Green was real, based on real value, had solid origins not sweat shop origins, and along with what tax could be extracted from his fawning tycoon fan base Blair could, along with government borrowing, create the ideal “third way” socialist society. Socialism relying on greed….the origins of secular westernism.\nAnyway, the dissonance between the aspirations of the blue collar workers and the Blair elite has become more exposed as the smoke and mirrors basis for the economy has been exposed for the fraud it really is. Politicians who should represent people representing corporations. Politicians who should be creating the conditions for business, protecting corporations ahead of struggling workers and small businesses. A social agenda which, inspired by the EU wrapped small and medium business up in red tape whilst protecting corporations by subsidising workers wages. The rich men of Blair and Cameron’re economy were little more than card sharks skimming the politicians for all they could get away with. The moral decline goes hand in hand with this economic madness.\nThe final part of the process, of course, is the law. Blair and his gullibility did not only expose the economy to risk but by buying into the idea that business was good but public bodies were in need of scrutiny and were inherently bad he engineered the rise of the human rights industry. We all understand human rights, public bodies can’t hit you, steal from you or otherwise abuse you, but we have gone beyond the actual law into an Alice in wonderland law, a law which as Marx would attest reflects the fundamentals of the Alice in Wonderland economy. Nice work Tone!",

So we won’t do that. We explain our policies.\nThe vision of Blue Revolution is to extend democracy and make Britain safe in perpetuity. We need it as violence both domestic and street violence is going up and the binary political system can’t deliver an answer. The nature of politics, therefore, has to change and we need to extend the legislature down to almost parish level using elected representatives and technology in a wholly 21st century way. Our aim, therefore, is to deliver enhanced democracy into a parliament that has been designed (in the 18th century) to meet the needs of elites past and present. This is why Corbyn can argue that the ‘system’ works against the people, but he hasn’t done his analysis and therefore doesn’t know why. We do know why and will make every elected representative in the country a contributor to the legislature and to the national debate. Had this happened in the recent past we would not have got ourselves up to our neck in the EU, We would not have had the industrial unemployed silting up the departments of the state with crime and unemployment. We would have adjusted public spending to accommodate the effects of globalisation, rather than throwing these workers into the hands of global markets which promptly found no use for them and put them on the scrap heap, there maintained on a diet of welfare and health care.\nSo what of our pledges at this election in Boston and Skegness. Well out of the EU but with closer trade links with the real countries of Europe. This is fairly obvious but in reality may be difficult to deliver. However, it is the trade that has healed rifts within the continent of Europe, not the EU which is now threatening to destabilise the continent due to tensions around migration, youth unemployment, bailouts, the Euro and demands for an ever closer political union and economic convergence. A vision of a contented continent trading freely is a vision every country will identify with.\nMore workplace democracy for public sector and publicly funded workers. It is clear when you speak to public sector workers who operate in some of the most hostile environments that they feel bullied by a system that demands performance to a measured set of targets. We would recommend that targets are scrapped and the hierarchy in public services flattened. Rank structures that owe more to the 19th-century industry rather than the 21st century public services must go and staff at the actual delivery end of public services should design implementation models for the services they are the experts in and deliver to the people.\nCut State Bureaucracy but not the public services we the people pay for and need! Above the delivery end of services, there are ranks of highly paid people who don’t deliver services but manage the processes and targets set by the government. Essentially they add no actual value but they cost money to employ. We would simplify the structures within public services whether it is street lights or adult social care and cut at the top, not the bottom. Modern technology will be used to make this happen.\nDeliver education suited to all abilities and scrap SATS and Student Debt. SATS are a cruel measure of schools and a child’s aptitude. Simple school-based tests which are based on Maths and Spelling should be used to inform children and parents about a child’s attainment level with advice on how to improve. The whole “it’s the schools’ fault” ideology which has undermined education and morale must go. We support selection but selection can be accommodated within schools by having certain students learning via IT at virtual grammars within their own school. Students’ in debt is an outrage, it deters progression up career ladders for the working class indebted student, as debt repayment kicks in. It thus reinforces the disadvantage it is supposed to prevent. The use of technology should allow students more flexibility with living costs and with cutbacks in the number of universities the debt should in our view be put back on the state’s books. This might be utopian but the option needs to be considered.\nStop people getting rich at the ordinary taxpayer’s expense. The upper echelons of the state machine and local government offer some horrendous examples of people getting hundreds of thousands of pounds in salary. Sunderland’s Chief Executive earns about £600,000 pounds in addition to a pension no doubt and the left wing councils are unsurprisingly the most generous. This outage will have to stop. No one paid directly or indirectly by the taxpayer should have a pensionable salary above £150,000 and no one should earn more than this at the public’s expense, indeed most should earn well below this.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_our-response-to-islamophobia-is-a-classical-marxist-view-of-the-issue-sent-to-westminster-parties/content_88.html": "Our response to ‘Islamophobia’ is a Classical Marxist view of the issue sent to Westminster parties\nDear Party Chairperson\nWe understand you have adopted the definition of Islamophobia as “a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness”. We are sure that you have been contacted by some groups criticizing this definition which the government has chosen not to adopt. We are an organisation that represents a small number of working people and some of us identify ourselves as classically Marxist in our approach to Politics. We too are concerned that you have adopted this definition and we will explain why.\nFirstly, according to the views of Karl Marx all religion represents different stages in the development of human consciousness. Marx described this evolution of consciousness in terms of humanity casting off “snake skins” and different religions represent different stages in that process. As our consciousness matures over millennia, some groups gain power and come to recognise, ‘injustice’ and ‘unfairness’ within the context of their life experience and on the back of new material realities changes in thinking take place. Religion thus reflects past material circumstances and is therefore ideological, promoting a material reality which works to the advantage of some groups over others, men over women for example.\nHowever, religion differs from mere ideology in that unlike an ideology (like socialism or communism for example) it is identified with the divine. In the case of Christianity, the divine is the personhood of Jesus the son of God, in the case of Islam, the divine is the Qur’an Gods word dictated to Muhammed by the Archangel Gabriel. By promoting Islamophobia as “a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness” you are at risk of protecting from criticism ideas that have little modern relevance and indeed may advance the cause of a consciousness which accepts different moral standards to many promoted in the twenty-first century West. In Marxist terms you are asking us or at least some of us to try and re-enter or remain within, a now discarded snakeskin, at least discarded in much of the liberal western world.\nOne final point and that relates to the frankly inaccurate claim that Islamophobia is a type of racism. By including this in your definition you essentially turn all criticism of Islam into racism and people who legitimately criticise Islam into racists. This may not be what you intend to do, we are sure your consciousness has evolved to the point where you wish to defend freedom of expression and freedom of speech. However, your definition will make it increasingly hard for those who wish to challenge Islam to do so.\nWe are fully in support of any definition of Islamophobia which is intended to protect the rights of individuals to speak their truth even if their ideas represent the views of an earlier age or period of collective consciousness and therefore may offend. However, it must be a definition which refers to protecting people rather than ideas, ideologies or faiths. This is the twenty-first century and all working people and those of all faiths and none need to speak their truth openly and without fear of persecution or indeed prosecution.\nBlue Revolution",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_1063/content_51.html": "Class consciousness. Its why the Labour Party lost the 2019 election.\n25th December 2019\nDear Friend\nI am from a small political group based in Boston Lincolnshire. Although we all hold slightly different political views, we are all united in the belief that the political system is undemocratic and is holding Britain back. I personally write about these issues from a Classical Marxist perspective usually for a centre-right audience. In view of the recent Tory Party General Election success, I thought you might like to consider our broad view on their success and Labour’s failure to connect with the electorate – particularly their traditional electoral strongholds in the Midlands and North.\nTo understand the Tory Party success in the 2019 General Election it is necessary to grasp the concept of voter consciousness and to view this through the prism of classical Marxism. At Blue Revolution, we offer a twenty-first-century Marxist analysis which we hope will inform debates across the whole political spectrum and which we hope will contribute to the development of radical and progressive policies. The aim of these policies would be the continued empowerment of ordinary working people; the modern working class.\nUntil the late twentieth century, working-class militancy was driven by fury at the perception of burning economic and social injustices. These injustices were linked by the British left-wing, to the illegitimate use of economic elitism, unfairness and class-based status. The Tory Party became to many on the left and remains for some, the enduring political symbol of these injustices. However, there is a growing awareness among working people that the situation is more complicated than this simple political trope suggests. Working people have enjoyed growing political sophistication explained in Marxist terms as raised consciousness. People can see through political simplicities.\nThe consciousness of the working class is, according to Marx, formed by a complex set of significant economic and social factors. There was the industrial reality of the nineteenth century that demanded worker co-operation in the production of goods and services, yet simultaneously alienated them from the working environment. Alienation is a feeling of being disconnected from the process of production – being in effect simply a cog in a wheel.\nAnother significant factor in the development of worker consciousness was ‘exploitation’. Whilst workers created wealth, they saw no benefit from having done so. Only the bourgeoisie aka capitalists got rich on the wealth created by workers’ labour-power. In Marx’s day ordinary workers worked long unregulated hours, they were ill-educated, unhealthy and poor with no political rights.\nCapitalism in its creation had struggled out from under the ‘yoke’ of feudalism by developing revolutionary legal principles; most relevantly, contract, choice and consent. In the 1840s these principles, of course, were only enjoyed by the capitalists, but in theory, as opposed to eighteenth and nineteenth-century practice they could legally apply to the working class too. The fact they didn’t was due to the capitalists preventing working people from enjoying these principles to maintain their ‘class advantage’.\nWhilst the capitalist system was good for capitalists and the political elite who maintained this ‘bourgeois’ political system and economy for them, it was bad for workers. In Marxist terms, it had within it the ‘the seeds of its own destruction’. These seeds were growing resentment at the poor treatment of workers, coupled to rising worker consciousness of the capitalist systems legal principles of contract, choice and consent. Over time workers become aware of how these legal principles were being used illegitimately to promote elitism and unfairness. The upshot according to Marx would be a revolution.\nTo overcome their enforced alienation, exploitation and denial of the rights to ‘freely’ contract, choose and consent, workers had to overcome false consciousness. Religion, the concept of a capitalist ‘fair wage’ and exclusion from political power, all helped to reinforced worker false consciousness or acceptance of the status quo. Having acquired collective raised consciousness i.e. being able to see disadvantage and being unwilling to accept it, a revolution would ensue.\nAfter the revolution, the workers would acquire for themselves the rights associated with the bourgeoisie. Had an actual Marxist revolution ever taken place the working class would not only have assumed control of the means of production – thus ending alienation and exploitation – but they would take control of the state too, thus providing for themselves an education, welfare and healthcare. The Russian revolution failed to deliver ‘justice’ because the people were denied power by Lenin and then Stalin’s autocratic state.\nAs a result of progressive social policies in Britain, the circumstances for modern working people do not resemble those of the nineteenth-century proletariat. Working people have acquired many of the economic freedoms and social benefits denied to us in Marx’s mid-nineteenth century. We have thus had our collective demands fulfilled by evolution rather than revolution. This has removed the anger which fuelled the urge for revolution amongst our forebears. Our collective consciousness no longer demands, but now expects worker’s rights to be upheld, universal education, healthcare and a fair welfare system. The working class has moved on. Sadly, our political system hasn’t moved on with us.\nWhere the bourgeois system continues to alienate the working class is now not so much in economic as political terms. Parliament itself stands as a proud symbol of bourgeois status, class and elitism, denying the working class the political power a properly Marxist revolution would have delivered.\nWorking-class consciousness is now shaped by contract, choice and consent, the enlightenment principles underpinning the free market. People might not routinely articulate these principles, but as Marx would have said that’s because as principles they have taken on ‘social character’. People don’t need to articulate them, but they feel it when these principles are breached against their class interests. These principles more than the burning social and economic injustices of the nineteenth century define the collective consciousness of the twenty-first century working class.\nThat said ordinary people have a growing awareness that these principles remain gifts to be granted to working people by those in power. They do not belong to us by right. The Brexit debacle proved that. Our bourgeois parliament controls our nation and is not under any obligation to us. A referendum is only ever advisory. It advises our bourgeois parliament, which is quite within its rights to ignore our views.\nBourgeois political systems across the western world continue to maintain political power structures based on eighteenth-century elitism in the face of working-class demands for greater contract and consent. There is a growing recognition that elitist political structures don’t justify the existence of political elites. The reality for working people ‘buffering’ against the old elitist structures has created a fractious political climate that the personality of Boris Johnson and his apparent stance on Brexit has been able to temporarily overcome. Hence his landslide victory.\nThere are many policy areas where people have been denied a voice by the Westminster political class; the policy of greater EU integration or the war in Iraq are two. However, we will look at Brexit and the continuing influence of ‘religion’ in politics. The aim is to illustrate the point that a new twenty-first-century radicalism is needed which is relevant to working people’s expectations and brings an end to political structures that neither reflect modern working-class consciousness nor promote progressive values but reinforce political elitism.\nIn 2016 the British had Project Fear unleashed on them by a Brussels-obsessed political elite. The elite promoted unfairness by failing to listen to ordinary people and by promoting themselves as an entitled and informed political class. The narrowness of the leave victory was a success for Project Fear. The triumph of a white, middle-class and remote parliamentary elite offended the class consciousness of Britain’s working people. The British working class with no ‘skin’ in the EU game recognised that the EU project was bureaucratic, unfathomable and unnecessary for the business of trade and friendship. The upshot of parliament supporting the EU was a miserable failure of the bourgeois left to make headway on this issue in the 2019 General Election. The left had stopped listening to working people and had consolidated around their London elite. The EU issue was also a failure of the political system to reflect working people’s expectations and highlighted how little real power we have. The success of Boris Johnson will be used to justify the current political system, which for growing numbers of working people is simply not good enough.\nOur next issue being more about modern values than policy reflects the absence of a confident political maturity on the part of the political class compared to the maturity of Britain’s working people.\nMost people in Britain have no time for religion and fewer than half believe in God. This is an important and progressive part of working-class collective consciousness. Of those who do believe in God, their God if Judaeo Christian or Islamic comes packaged as an ideology that Karl Marx said reflected various stages in the development of humanity’s evolving consciousness.\nWe have a working class that is perhaps mildly interested in cultural symbolism but is basically disinterested in God or religion. A bit culturally Christian but possessing an enlightened consciousness based on choice and consent underpinned not by God but by science. This large class has been forced to witness uncritical support for the faith of Islam, a faith that reveals doctrinally no grasp of the importance of choice and consent but which is regularly promoted and protected from criticism by a culturally-illiterate and largely (but not exclusively) left-wing elite.\nBy failing to understand the basic fact that the history of God is a history of class exploitation and gender discrimination of one sort or another, the left is failing to connect with working-class values of the twenty-first century.\nIf the left continues to promote religious ideologies of all types which are seen by working people to promote sectarianism, as well as divinely sanctioned discrimination, particularly against gay people and women, it will never be considered progressive. Moreover, it goes against the grain of classical Marxism, being a failure on the part of the left to liberate people from the remnants of global exploitation and oppression, which continues to be justified on the basis that it’s divinely ordained. Think Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nIn the twenty-first century the challenge for western politics is to reform our elite political systems so working people have more influence over the state and those who operate it on our behalf. Currently, the only option open to working people is to seek out political heroes and give them landslide majorities. The Labour Party hoped Corbyn would do this in 2017 and 2019. The process of a personality like Thatcher, Blair, Corbyn, Johnson or Trump tapping into working-class consciousness isn’t new. When it happens, it is a symptom that the political system is unwilling or incapable of giving real power to working people. Under such a system working people only have hero-worship to fall back on and that has, in the past, gone badly wrong! Sadly, as was seen during the 2019 General Election campaign having ‘outspoken’ working-class candidates supposedly representing working-class people isn’t the same as giving working-class people real political power.\nSo, what are the radicals who are prepared to break the system from the left or indeed right going to do? Well, we have some ideas which are intended to empower local authority council members to scrutinise parliamentary policy and in time acquire the right to become part of the legislature. This would run alongside scrapping the House of Lords. We hope you will do your bit to shift the debate about democracy away from making the current system look like its working and argue for changing the current system – because frankly, it doesn’t work and never really has worked for the many, just the few.\nYours sincerely\nMike Gilbert part of a Blue Revolution",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-growing-toxicity-of-supply-side-orthodoxy/content_297.html": "The growing toxicity of supply side orthodoxy.\nJust like collapsing stars, collapsing capitalism will leave a dense and unfathomable black hole, that, as it struggles to contain its own intolerable density, which is the need to maintain elitism and inequality, will destroy society. The process has already started.\nCapitalism was described as ‘anarchy’ by numerous socialist thinkers in the 19th century. This anarchy was founded on the liberating principles of consent-based choice and contract. They were the three universal rules, and everyone had to play by them. The affluent merchant and later industrial producer as well as the exploited worker who toiled to make both the merchant and industrialist rich were legally obliged to observe contract and consent-based choice.\nThe role of the banking system within this model was to expand the economy cautiously and incrementally with increased money supply occurring as the combination of capital and labour power fused to drive the demand for goods, achieve their supply via productivity, and thus create profits.\nIt was always an uneasy relationship, this relationship between demand and supply, and crisis often occurred when supply was greater than demand. People were laid off and the economy shrank. Company failure was in the very beginning the reset button. Companies failed and new opportunities sprang up to improve the quality and price of goods and take on more workers. At least that was the theory.\nAs capitalism matured though, rather than just individual company failures, capitalism’s free market drive for profits led to the consolidation of production. Basically, bigger companies grew out of smaller company failures. When a crisis occurred the state also intervened to increase demand by pumping money into the economy so people could buy goods. This is demand management and it was essentially a left-wing state interventionist response to capitalisms periodic failures. It benefited the working class by creating jobs to stimulate demand.\nBy the 1970’s Western capitalism was in serious trouble because profitability was being squeezed. Consolidation within industries had made them complacent and sluggish. Wages had been increased to a more humane level, but this had hit profitability. Wages could not slide back as profits slumped. There were few realistic options available, company failures grew, and demand for products fell. In addition to this crisis in profitability companies were hit by a spike in energy prices causing inflation coupled to the downturn in demand.\nThe UK had an additional problem a belief that ‘the state’ should take money off the taxpayer to pay the workers in nationalised industries, not as a demand stimulus but as an entitlement. The left-wing orthodoxy of demand management was no longer delivering what it was supposed to. The West was now in competition with the rest of the world and demand management and government ownership would not help. . . Indeed, it seemed to be making matters worse.\nIf demand management was no longer effective, because it contributed to general inflation as fewer products were being manufactured there was poor quality, high public expenditure and wage inflation, so the thinking went that maybe liberalising the supply side of the economy would do the business of saving the Western world’s economy. ‘Supply side’ in effect means ensuring that supplies of all goods and services are delivered efficiently at the cheapest possible price. This of course includes labour power or the supply of workers as well as the supply of money itself. As long as things were cheap, the general inflation rate was low and interest rates ‘competitive’ the money supply could increase, thus stimulating demand without causing inflation and everything should remain in balance.\nFor forty years this model has infected every aspect of thinking, from government and business in the 1980’s and 1990’s to the public sector from 2000 onwards.\nIt began with selling council houses in the 1980’s. Valuable housing assets were taken from Local Authorities and were transferred to the banking sector and financial services industries via mortgages. This increased the money that individuals could ‘leverage’ or borrow against their housing asset. It was however sold as a political good news story for workers rather than a good news story for the banking sector.\nThe Government thus moved a huge number of public assets into the financial and service sectors and with that the means of managing demand became a function of the supply of money, money created not by the combination of capital exploiting labour. but by the ability of the financial services and banking sector to create money with whatever assets they were able to use to leverage. The markets rather than the government controlled this process. If general inflation was low, any amount of money created could only grow the economy. It was an Alice in Wonderland model based on political naivety, public expectation, and financial services hubris.\nThe assets that could be leveraged therefore included ex council homes and stocks and shares in once nationalised industries.\nMy suspicion at the time was that in the minds of politicians this money supply side approach would generate healthy demand and create a variety of jobs satisfying the need for both new goods as well as services. However in the minds of bankers and global corporations the West would become awash with cheap goods made outside of the West. These cheap goods would keep inflation down, profits up and as money circulated this would provide service sector jobs creating an illusion of a strong ‘real economy’.\nIt worked for a while but the problem with money and general supply side management is that someone must supply the cheap money, justify that supply with assets and without causing inflation and do it within a context of slowly reducing well-paid manufacturing employment for working people.\nBy the late 1990’s it was clear that the supply side model was running out of steam, but the demand model was still debunked. Blair’s government adopted supply side orthodoxy uncritically and took supply side ideology into the public sector, hoping to ‘tee’ the public sector up for privatisation.\nThe push for home ownership, started in the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives when they sold council homes became the way money supply expanded. More mortgages, more borrowing against house price inflation, more money swilling around, more credit card debt. With the growth od ‘derivatives’ there were opportunities to bundle up mortgages and sell them to investors as risk-free investments, with, in theory, a good return as people made their mortgage repayments each month. The ‘markets’ grip on reality was loosening.\nThis bit of supply side exuberance lasted until 2007. The breath-taking level of overreach by the banking sector resulted in the crash of 2007/8. The banks had balance sheets based on high house price values. But these prices were not a reflection of the strength of the property market or economy in general and therefore didn’t reflect people’s ability to repay their loans. Just as now, there was and remains no ‘real economy’ just money supply within a context of low interest rates and low inflation. With no real economy, people defaulted on their huge and unrealistic mortgage loans. The whole banking system was bankrupt and crashed.\nBecause the West had moved headlong into supply side economics out of economic necessity, the only solution to the banking crisis was bank bailouts by governments and the introduction of stupidly low almost zero interest rates.\nThis was the next crank of the supply side screw. Again, it worked. For a while. People borrowed and spent; house building expanded to meet a fictional ‘high demand’ but continued to be bought as investments at ever increasing prices. This further expanding money supply and stimulated demand in a low inflation era. The supply of cheap imported unskilled labour continued, as did the importation of goods made abroad. With low inflation nothing seemed to threaten this model. Keep on importing cheap labour (labour needs housing too), keep spending money, buying houses, and borrowing and all will be good. At least for the bankers and corporations.\nBy the late 2000’s new threats were beginning to emerge. One such threat is that the West has an ageing population of people who own their own their own homes outright. This locks that house price ‘value’ out of the banking system. There is therefore a glut of housing, which offers nothing of monetary value to the banking system unless equity released or sold after death. But then housing gluts would likely force down prices. Good for buyers, bad for the markets.\nThe supply side monetary model needs high house prices and for prices to rise year on year. The markets have been lucky as since 2008 and until 2022 nothing has seriously threatened the supply side fundamentals of low general inflation, low interest rates and escalating house and other ‘asset’ prices. Even Brexit didn’t succeed in slowing the flow of cheap unskilled labour still much needed to make the model of supply side economics work.\nHowever, amplified by the war in Ukraine, Chinese paranoia over Covid and energy price instability it is now becoming clear that the supply side model is not without serious consequences for ordinary people. Viewing it uncritically and continually trying to get it to work is undermining society on an almost irreparable scale.\nIn addition to the export of manufacturing to cheap labour markets like China, thus destroying livelihoods for millions of British working people, there is the additional consequence that poor wages and welfare generates too little demand and doesn’t help local economies. Town centres and less fashionable cities like Stoke on Trent become dormitories for migrant workers a growing number of whom arrive with little inclination to work. They thus provide no meaningful economic demand, and only take up the slack in the town and city centre market for Houses of Multiple Occupation.\nThe consequence of supply side economics failing to deliver sufficient economic demand in town and city centres is that these locations become shabby ‘melting pots’, managed reactively by police and local authorities. Adopting supply side orthodoxy themselves agencies only supply services on an ‘intelligence led’ basis, thus leaving people to essentially fend for themselves. No wonder people are angry. The money needed to rejuvenate town centres ends up in the hands of new build property developers who take full advantage on the flight of indigenous locals to the outskirts of town. Once in a new build, wages don’t go into the local economy, they go into home entertainment and fancy cars, both necessary to survive the numbing existence offered by these locations.\nThe supply side orthodoxy was so enthusiastically taken up by the banking system and financial markets that it was considered an appropriate model to inflict on the public and educational sector. Students became consumers and higher education supplied an educational product; the financial risk being borne by the student.\nThe orthodoxy of supply side economics has turned public services into organisations which supply products and interventions, and the efficiency of this supply is calculated by ‘score cards and performance measures. The proliferation of measurers and managers who oversee this process has created a class system within the public sector with grotesque wage differentials to reflect this. The toxicity of supply side management has created a mental health and recruitment and retention crisis all over the public sector.\nSo, in summary, the supply side revolution, which seemed so logical back in the late 1970’s has faltered and has now stopped. Its survival, as an economic theory is destroying western society. In its death throws it retains an ability to generate wealth for the few. But for the many a depleting lifestyle of declining local economies, poor town centre housing stock, debt, high inward migration, with the associated flight from town centres by the remaining workers is the reality.\nFor the supply side model to do what it does efficiently low interest rates need to fuel borrowing and therefore spending binge and of course inflation must be low assisted by low wages and cheap foreign manufactured products. However, the longer this process continues, like a black hole the denser the problems it leaves behind will be.\nWith a forty-year supply side orthodoxy the West is not so much an economy as a series of interconnected money manufacturing markets that are sensitive to changes in economic fundamentals like general inflation, and interest rates. The war in Ukraine and Covid have unleashed disturbances that will have long term effects. The bankers and markets will blame Brexit for Britain’s struggle to get back on track. The real answer however is to move away from supply side orthodoxy and get back to managing demand at a level that creates real jobs, wealth, and happiness, without creating inflation. That means putting power back into politics and taking it away from the markets.

They are the power holders, politicians mainly, but operating with an agenda, and in an environment which differs depending on the economic realities they have both created and promote. In post-Blair Britain, the “free market” characterised by naked greed was used to create a debt-based environment which promoted and paid for a corrosive form of socialism that has left Britain massively indebted to the banks and racked with social and economic problems such as family breakdown, health and social care crises. The huge wage differentials in the UK giving the lie to any pretence the aim was to try to reduce inequality rather than make certain “friends” of the Blair establishment rich.\nIn the US the people call Hilary Clinton a “crook”. She is the stateside version of the Blair economic phenomenon, except in the US they have the constitution which allows such comments to be expressed openly. They probably can’t say why she is a “crook”, she probably isn’t a “Crook” in the accepted sense of the term but she has done well on the debt of the nation and the American people. In the western economic model it’s OK to make money like this………but to us at a Blue Revolution this is the heart of the problem no it’s not OK to skim the economy and its people to very generously line the pockets of the few whilst using some tax from debt based wealth and some government borrowing to pay welfare to the amoral “underclass”.\nThe lawyers, particularly that brand of left wing sanctimonious bureaucratic parasite that feeds off the processing errors of poorly paid “operational” public servants (but is happy to proclaim Blair free of any misfeasance for “war-related atrocities”) are also recipients, but generous recipients of government spending this time.\nIn too many respects the “feelings” Americans have about Clinton reflect the “feelings” most Britains have about Blair and lawyer Mrs Blair. But here he has created an industry to look after his interests and the interests of the Establishment and its hangers on like our Human Rights lawyers, other friendly publicsectorcrats, and oh Phillip Green et al.\nSo what of the FA the NHS and the BMA. Well, these latter two represent the top of the Public Sector employees, crown princes and princesses of the publicsectocracy. Like big media organisations, they create a monopoly for certain public sector roles and thereby they can drive up wages by bullying the government and patients. The media organisations play a similar conjuring trick with football. A man who can kick a ball gets paid more in a week than some people earn in a lifetime. The money comes from media companies who hold the sports viewng public over a financial barrel.\nSo what is the Blue Revolutionary answer; well we find it hard to come up with one. The mischief could be corrected if there was a model of payment for services (medical payments, footballers wages, being a celebrity etc) which better reflects the public’s actual willingness to pay for the medical intervention, football match and celebrity. Authors and musicians are a good example of how to some extent the market works…until TV and Film Corporations start their wage distorting and inflating activities.\nHow improvement is achieved we don’t fully know but we are honest about that. It requires a shift at every social level and perhaps it needs people to “collectivise” their viewing (Sharing TV and on-line) and stop getting into debt to go to the football. The role of the Government in medicine makes it difficult to imagine how this particular barrel can be got over. One option would be to give “Health vouchers” to people but that would require a fifty-year programme of getting people once again to take responsibility for their health. Being unhealthy has been too easy for too long!\n03.09.16 Selective education, bias and middle class angst; how to square the circle. V2\nAs anyone who reads this blog will know we have a particular take on economics and social evolution and so don’t subscribe to the usual “lefty” causes of equality…….blah blah blah. The reality is we are not born the same and we are not going to die the same. However, it is important for the health of any society that it allows its citizens to achieve what they are capable of achieving, to promote the collective good. This is not achieved by promoting the corrosive values of greed or the laughably inept strategy of government meddling or social engineering apropos Blair et al.\nSociety is a little like a kettle on a trivet, with each leg of the trivet being one of Capitalism’s legacy values of Contract, Choice, and Consent. The Kettle can happily bubble away with the minimum of fuss as long as someone is topping it up with water and ensuring the trivet is strong enough to hold the kettle. Destabilise the trivet and the kettle like society will tip.\nSo when we explore the issue of selective education of which we tend to agree is a good thing, we need to ensure that it is delivered in a way which allows as many people as possible to feel that they have enjoyed the same levels of Contract, Choice, and Consent as everyone else. We don’t want our trivet to tip over and spill the contents of the kettle because only some people can realistically consent to selection and then choose a grammar school based upon irrelevant factors related to a child’s ability such as class, rurality, nationality, or any other bogus criteria.\nWe have at a Blue Revolution some people who have experience in the field of education and they will tell anyone who is interested that whilst selection to identify academic ability is good, the eleven plus is bad. The eleven plus identifies children who have parents have schooled them in passing the eleven plus. Whether it is verbal or non-verbal reasoning tests, a child can quickly learn to spot the pattern and very soon can be proficient in “the test”. Middle-class parents can also afford to buy the practice papers and can coach their children to ensure that they stand a better chance of passing the eleven plus than children who have parents unable to purchase the papers or indeed understand the point of them.The result of “coaching is that academic children miss out to those who can “pass the test” and grammar schools have too many children who would have benefitted prom a less pressurise non-grammar school education.\nSo from a Blue Revolution and as usual based on discussion and we believe common sense a cheap solution to the complex problem of making the selection of children at 11 to 13 fairer and less class determined.\nFirstly any test has to be based on actual arithmetic and the technical knowledge of skills in literacy. The days when tests such a non-verbal reasoning tests were considered to indicate anything of relevance to learning should by now be long gone. A simple benchmark could be used such as spelling age and skills based around the manipulation of numbers or the times-tables. This simple methodology could test children up to A level standard at the age of between 11 and 13 and for those who had clear proficiency well above the average, a selective education will almost certainly be appropriate. The benefits of this model are threefold.\n- It will be understood by all parents of whatever ability themselves. Most people know what maths involves even if they can’t do it. So testing will not be based on obscurities that only the privileged can get access to. It will also mean that mums and dads from poorer backgrounds will know what is measured during selection and may be able to access grandparents or neighbours to help upskill and encourage their children.\n- It doesn’t require “coaching” any child can as the author Julie Birchill once; did sit in the library on their own practicing the skills necessary to get through the 11 to 13 plus.\n- it doesn’t have to be complicated and can be delivered in a large hall with the questions given verbally. To add a further dimension simple questions based on a modern foreign language could be introduced as could a short essay.\nAll in all, we feel that or 11 to 13 test would lay down a benchmark for the child to evidence aptitude. The exam could be done at any time between the ages of 11 and 13 and builds on actual skills learn in the preceding years at school and at home but more importantly allows the child to us the skills measured to develop their aptitude in core curriculum subjects.\nChildren who pass these exams will be known to their peers, and the parents of their peers, as children who had love, stability, and encouragement from birth to the day they passed the test…….if indeed with all that they actually pass it.\n05.09.16 Global disapproval for Brexit and a perplexing lack of vision from the Brexiteers. Are they loosing their bottle?\nWell, who knows what is going in the world of the Brexit office. Lofty aspiration is not only appropriate it is essential when one is attempting to sway the world towards trade and away from national self-interest and the ever-present possibility of war. The EU which quite wrongly sees itself as an agent of long-term peace and prosperity is also wrongly seen by the world’s biggest economies as a body with whom they can do business. Again in theoretical terms of volume of people represented and thus simplicity yes the EU looks a good bet; but what is the chance of any one country negotiating a deal with the EU which satisfies all 27 countries of the EU. We believe that President Obama’s optimism is rather misplaced.\nWhat is less in doubt, is the vexed question of the UK’s access to the single market upon which it is reasonable to assume businesses based in the UK rely. This unfettered access is very important and would be a loss to the UK if it were not part of a renegotiated settlement. The problem for the Department of Brexit is that by continuing the claim that Brexit was solely about migration it has kept this, the most unedifying aspect of Brexit in the public domain, and therefore a part of the UK EU negotiation.\nPost-referendum, the emphasis should have shifted to sovereignty and world free trade neither of which were possible within the EU and allied to these two mischiefs we have the pointlessness of the EU parliament and much of its non-trade related commission. These latter institutions have strayed too far from the politics of global free trade and now having taken world free trade about as far as they are capable of taking it; have turned their attention to “social and political” integration. This is the mischief at the heart of the EU and it is a mischief that The UK was first to identify and act to deal with. Much was stirred into the debate on both sides which presented Brexit as about borders and immigration and to some extent it is. However, as economic and material determinists we at a Blue Revolution accept that a fundamental principle of free trade should (wherever possible) involve a degree of free movement of workers. Please note we refer to “free movement” of “Workers”. Workers are factors of production they are “economic” in character. “People” are part of a political process; an EU inspired unification process which few if any countries in the EU really want. Indeed if the EU elites want unification like the UK elites seem to want (Blair et al) one can assume with some certainty that their citizens don’t or won’t.\nSo where does this leave the Brexit Department? Well, firstly we believe that there needs to be a restatement that Britain both wants to remain as part of the free market and that more importantly, it understands the nature of the EU project and rejects its federalist and integrationist agenda and all the flummery that goes with it (commissions, courts, parliaments etc). Britain needs to explain that controlling immigration is not just about setting up an expensive buraucracy (points based system) and border control but about identifying the obstacles to getting British people into British jobs and getting qualified people from overseas (all countries not just EU) into vacancies to ensure the economy continues to operate effectively. On this basis, as we have always said, the problem is about welfare and the distorting effects of welfare on the labour market, both the UK and EU labour markets. Put simply get British people back to work and, more importantly, don’t accept the concept of free movement of people by offering welfare to EU workers and their families, simply\nPut simply get British people back to work via welfare reform and, more importantly, don’t accept the concept of free movement of people. Free movement of workers is as far as any country needs to go to fulfil its free trade treaty obligations. By offering welfare to EU workers and their families, rather than simply work to those migrants the UK simply encourages a level of free movement which creates the pressures that trigger public dissatisfaction. Firms should be licensed to manage the process of recruiting workers on the basis that they benefit from migration and should bear the cost and take the responsibility for them whilst they are here.\nWe still pay welfare to EU migrant workers. This should stop as part of an initial Brexit broadside to assuage public impatience and if it delivers a reduction in net migration we can review how far we need to go implementing a policy that could in theory ratchet right up to full border control. The world needs a model for the movement of workers in a globalised world. Britain needs to trial one!\n10.09.16 A Blue Revolution is a Moral revival; with a sensible approach to Grammar schools now on the agenda; where next?\nIt is amazing how the “happy clappy left” unwittingly become the foot soldiers of the elite by arguing that somehow grammar schools promote social division. Social division is a social reality and it is only members of the utopian Corbyn supporters club who think that children’s differences in ability, aptitude, drive, determination and areas of personal interest be those interests reading, maths, cars, Star Wars or simply having fun on social media can be corrected by social engineering. These are the differences that determine outcomes at every level of society. The lazy businessman reliant on post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory will wait until the banks or governments generate demand through debt rather than getting out and developing new markets. His company will fail in the face of hungry foreign competition. He will have failed the business 11+.\nHowever in the case of children it is absolutely wrong that the child who approaches a sensible test of ability (based on real stuff; reading, writing spelling, times tables, etc. rather than “intelligence tests” which test skill at doing tests as we have said before) should be disadvantaged by their class, their location, the ideology of their school or indeed the quality of their parenting.\nAt a Blue Revolution we are not really interventionists believing that social and economic value should be created by human activity and that even if “unemployed” in the economic sense, the pro-social citizen will be aware that they have an indirect economic role by being socially active creating a stable community within which the economically active can operate. We are interdependent if you will. If Mrs Thatcher had not said “there is no such thing as society” but had said instead “there is no such thing as government engineered society, there are simply individuals who are inter-dependent on each other”, she would not have become the left’s bogeywoman. The Blue Revolution may not have slid backwards by three decades under the social svengali and economic illiterate Tony Blair.\nIt is, therefore, clear to us that society has a role in creating opportunities for children, opportunities to get a demanding education which demands more from them than the average comprehensive education would. Some children and we agree only a small number thrive on this pressure. Who are these children…….well currently they are the children of the better off; or the less well off but from loving families; and therein lies the problem. The children who will have the social “foundation” to do well is also small. Most children are now products of insecure relationships, family breakdown, or indeed welfare babies “bred” for the access they give to the welfare system. The “system” does not identify these “families” our guess is for fear of exposing a social moral crisis.\nSo whilst we have finally got “grammars” talked about again as a way of meeting the needs of ordinary hard working academically enthusiastic children, we have a legacy of social decline which undermines the opportunities for children born into socially unfavourable environments. The “happy clappy left”are right about that. The answer, however, is not to throw money at the parents, it is to access the social value currently locked into the community.\nSo to make the whole life experience of children better and to increase the chances of becoming “Top People” in the public sector as well as a new “Beatles” or world-class lawyers and engineers we need to stop the moral decline at the bottom of society and reverse the trend for children to be brought up or brought into the world for reasons other than “love”.\nWhilst this sounds as utopian as a Corbyn economic five-year plan it would be possible if we started to see government promoting social health and started to stir the army of decent people who have become economically marginal but who can promote the kind of values children need if they are to achieve their full social and economic potential. We are talking about grandparents, neighbours, volunteers, and if necessary foster parents. At the lower end of the social hierarchy, the capacity of parents needs to be evaluated and their capacity to offer children a range of life chances assessed. If the parent is (like too many) anti-social, incompetent of simply a welfare womb for hire by a predatory “shagger” then the community needs to step in and the child fostered by one of an army of newly recruited foster carers.\nChilden are not just there to be fed and watered and the child care system should not be limited to making sure children won’t come to physical harm. We have enough economically marginal people who have solid values who should be called upon to help the government fight the war against long-term social and moral decline. We need an army of paid foster carers now.\n14.09.16 Post neo-classical endogenous growth theory; the riddle of the west revealed. Or at least debtamorphosis explained. V3\nPost neo-classical endogenous growth theory; the riddle of western economies revealed. Or at least debtamorphosis explained. We were reminded of this comical if somewhat pretentious bit of 1980’s phraseology a couple of weeks ago when someone was quoting Gordon Brown and his laughable “end of boom and bust” claim in the early days of optimism following the landslide election of New Labour in 1997. We understand neo-classical economics to be essentially what came to be known as Keynesianism. Keynesianism was a 20th-century interventionist economic theory which was intended to stimulate or engineer economic growth during periods of economic recession. In the hands of a prudent government saving in good times and spending in bad times and within a closed economy where the extra spent stayed in the economy and didn’t flow abroad, it would stimulate growth. It would, of course, have to be spent in a skilled environment, no point in trying to stimulate growth in an economy with no capacity to grow.\nPost-neo-classical endogenous growth theory then must be a re-engineering of Keynesianism but must owe something to the old theory. In essence, the similarity is the spending to stimulate the necessary growth. The problem is that in the absence of investment money saved, the money spent has to be borrowed. This makes the model very different from its neo-classical forebears. However, to make the model credible it had to use re-engineered terms like using “investment” for “borrowing and spending”. Economic growth became a function of “consumer confidence”. The whole model was intended to ensure aggregate demand was maintained as this was seen as the key to securing economic growth. Still with us?\nOk, alongside the new model there was a need to skill up the workforce; hence the “education,education, education” claim by Tony Blair. The model, therefore, had spending, investment, and the need to invest in people to stimulate economic growth. To evolve the model into a post neo-classical form and achieve the endogenous element for growth a whole new set of institutions and language was developed to add credibility to the model. There was “Investors in People”, the “European Excellence Model” called the Excrement Model by one of our wags. There was an emphasis on “value added” as though adding wage costs to a product’s sale price was the same as adding real value. The fact that government could tax more wages as “value added” created more wage earners processing various parts of the production or retail process, was a misunderstanding about what economic “value” really is. Economic value is not the same as price.\nThe model was fatally flawed. It only looked as though it was capable of delivering long-term endogenous growth without the need for continual government investment or as it is better understood; spending, but it could not do this. The model was complex, supported by diversity, training, and education (including student debt) and therefore had debt as the only basis for the growth and borrowing to maintain consumption as a substitute for proper economic investment.\nUltimately the growth required was on the whole debt based and remains implacably so today. Private debt supporting consumption is also a feature of the post neo-classical model. It doesn’t matter who’s debt it is, it will create the appearance of growth through confidence and by maintaining aggregate demand, at least in the short term.\nAs we have said in many previous posts, endogenous debt all too easily becomes wealth for those who are either able to game the market with cheaply manufactured but expensively sold products or who are paid by the state. We call this process debtamorphosis. It is an unintended consequence of the post-neoclassical model.\nWhilst irresponsible debt and unjustified wealth are two consequence of the model there are we believe other consequences more appalling and these may not be easily identified as being linked to the failure of the west’s post neo-classical endogenous growth model. These appalling consequences include the myriad wars prosecuted or supported by the west in places like the middle east. When endogenous growth models fail to deliver proper growth then the value necessary for growth has to be unlocked from places where there is value but it is locked into an unsophisticated, low skill and possibly tribal or working class communities. Mass immigration into the working class areas in the west unlocks economic value as does war in poorer countries.\nUnlocking “value” rather than Oil is probably what was behind the Bush and Blair wars. The industrial scale “human rights” business and a myriad of busineness opportunities to nation build were identified; in the west human rights deliver too many human wrongs and overseas the EU becomes calcified as the middle east far from being an opportunity for exogenous growth for the western economies with the help of ISIS the US and Russia, turns itself into the world’s biggest car less car park.\nSad but we believe true.\n19.09.16 The people who support Corbyn “feel” there is something wrong with Britain, but don’t know what it is. Corbyn seems to speak to the confused and ill informed but what is wrong with Britain and is Corbyn the answer?\nJeremy Corbyn has been around for decades playing the rebel by naively joining forces with any “anti-capitalist” who happened to be in Islington perhaps plotting hatred and destruction of Israel or promoting a mutilating blend of Islamism and misogyny. No worry though no one took Jeremy very seriously…..he isn’t very bright…no really he didn’t even complete his degree at North London Poly. Jeremy is a middle-class boy who has landed a middle-class job (being an MP) for a complex constituency where you had to be able to square numerous circles. Equality for gays and support for Islamists anyone. Only a wittering old fool could pull this off because no one really expected him to be able to square circles but as long as he was nice to people (except the hated Tories) he could muddle along happily enough.\nWhen the Labour Party was seeking a new leader, therefore, Jeremy was the Parliamentary party’s “lefty” of choice for the candidate slate; a bit simple, not too sophisticated, nice but dim and steeped in lefty eccentricities (beard, vest, sandals, making jam etc) and unlikely to win.\nHowever, the brooding of the masses which had built up since Tony Blair stole the heart of the Labour party had been recently vented with a right wing shift from right wing labour supporters to Ukip. The honest but naive Guardian reading middle and working class “lefty” meanwhile, as opposed to “old Labour” supporter, who went to Ukip, saw in Jeremy a representative who stood for “intellectual” left wing stuff. For example anti “capitalism”, and anti “greedy” bankers, equality, fairness, good jobs, anti-austerity, the NHS, immigration, the public sector, “caring”, arms around the world etc. Jeremy was a one-man repository for the angst of the 21st century “intellectual” lefty. Even though his ideas are whimsical and incoherent it doesn’t matter because he is nice and “can be trusted” etc. His ability to avoid any kind of scrutiny is not so much down to a mastery of politics as simply a long-held view of himself as ” everyone’s friend”. Whilst this is true it betrays a total lack of moral integrity and principle.\nSo can Jeremy or the Momentum heavies that use him to smooth their path to power sort out Britain. Well of course not. Britain is desperate to abandon the kind of post-war state-controlled moral and economic socialism that makes everyone but an erstwhile “Guardian” reader feel queasy and mentally and emotionally interfered with. But all the political parties seem to reflect this post-war paradigm to a greater or lesser extent and strangely Jeremy is seen as an antidote to it which he of course, isn’t. Far from it!\nThe problem for Britain is that in too many of its important institutions it is essentially feudal, based on rigid hierarchy, command and control, power and authority. Modern socialism with its sanctimonious tentacles in Parliament and the Courts (particularly the disgrace of the human rights “industry”), the Civil Service, Health Service, police and legal professions is not going to abandon this hierarchical post-war pseudo-feudalism anytime soon. Jobs, status and pay at our expense depend on it and Jeremy will simply empower it and expand it as the actual economy for what it is currently worth struggles to borrow to pay for it all.\nWith the free market economy badly in need or reform and too reliant on debt and the public sector funded by debt; Jeremy is part of the problem and not part of the cure. If he started to look at the legal profession its costs and activities, the judiciary and the stupid cost of British “justice” the financially unsustainable and humanly wasteful criminal justice system, and the way the public sector (including sainted NHS) strips value from the economy whilst promoting debt and immorality he may begin to speak the language of revolution. As it is he is just another embarrassing 20th century left wing wind bag the like of which we the blue collar working and entrepreneurial masses have been trying to politely ignore for years.\nUp the revolution….the Blue Revolution.\n20.09.16 Following on from the recent posts on economics and society; how can we tell things are out of kilter?\nWe have examined post neo-classical endogenous growth theory and how in the absence of a closed economy mass inward migration and perhaps even war is utilised as a way of freeing up stored value locked into houses and communities within Western economies and beyond their various shores. This combined with debt fuels the “western economic model”. It is an economic paradigm which has like all previous paradigms got failure built into its DNA. As Karl Marx said, all paradigms or “epochs” sow the seeds of their own destruction. But it takes an extra era to cleanse society of the last threads of the periods that came before them. In simple terms to rid society of Feudalism in its many lingering manifestations, particularly in politics and law, it will take a paradigm that goes beyond capitalism or socialism. Socialism is a model of society which cannot rid itself of power-based hierarchy, authority and inequality because socialism requires these to order society in its theoretical image. The power of courts to pretend they deliver “human rights” rather than relying on humans respecting rights without the cost of the court is just one element of the “socialist” elitist process. And of course, socialism relies on the power of the state to deliver its other key ambitions, “equality”, “diversity” and “opportunity” the reality of which achieves all too often a shift from one sort of inequality to another; greater sexual equality replaced by a widening of economic and geographical inequality.\nIn the case of the current “socialist” or “mixed economic” paradigm the concepts born in the firmament of early capitalism; Contract, Choice and Consent are the seeds that threaten the socialist model’s long-term survival. The problem for the blue collar workers poised as they should be to take control of the levers of state power via the ballot box is that there are amassed forces of obstruction building up. These massed forces are without exception the “Barrons” of the public sector, and particularly the lawyer politician and the court. They don’t want a society and polity based on contract choice and consent as it would undermine the power of the state and its institutions to “govern” the masses in the way the masses “need” to be governed. And of course this at the financial expense of the masses themselves. In the absence of income from new economic value, the masses bankroll the socialist society with their personal debt and they are similarly burdened with paying taxes to pay government debt and government wages. Who really consents to do that? Yet it is the socialist who wants to ignore the will of the people over British Brexit and to burden the poor with more debt as the stuff shirted lawyers, civil servants and politicians grow fat on the debt of blue collar workers. This is the contradiction that Marx, had he been here, would have recognised. But you have us in the absence of Marx.\nWith relationships based on the decent values of capitalism namely contract, choice and consent (as distinct from the reality of early capitalism still with the corrupting blood of the feudal system pumping through its early elitist veins) the public can begin to develop new political institutions (similar to the Brexit vote). This process based on a moral free market economy will realign power to ensure that in the future the decent instincts of the public, uncorrupted by social alienation and the power of the state, and with a meaningful contract with those that govern them, will lead to a growing sense of social harmony. This isn’t utopianism as it has economic materialism at its core. We will explore this idea further, because how do you govern without the governing gaining a sense of power over the governed . If you understand the nature of a Blue Revolution, economic determinism and the power of Contract Choice and Consent the problem is less insoluble than it at first appears.\n22.09.16 Some billionaires become schemeingly political to preserve their wealth whilst others give the wealth away. Guess which is the Blue Revolutionary?\nThere is something sickening about Donald trump; and please don’t think it is because he is a populist, we have no concerns about such people in a healthy democracy, indeed they add colour and texture to a process which for too many people is “long in the tooth” and boring, namely democracy. Like Brexit in the UK, it takes something scary and heterodox to excite people and as the UK has found the consequences are benign in the short to medium term and like a journey, if you set off in the right direction in in the short to medium term the long term the risks of deviating slightly on the journey are at worst minimal.\nSo what of Trump? Well, Trump is a Billionaire and as such preens and promotes himself as though his ideas have a value and magnificence they would not have if the mythical “Joe the plumber” was coming out with them. It is a combination of his vacuous ideas and his wealth that makes us a little queasy. We feel the same way when a “Sleb” or rock star starts to promote ideas which are clearly daft if you happen to be receiving them in the land of the ordinary person. Sting, Russell Brand, and a bevvy of entitled wealthy people who want to diminish the lives of ordinary people often by persuading them that it is in their best interests to be exploited by commercial interests, or “marketing” as it is better known. This is a bit Like ISIS offering “dust bowl “Islamism to stressed communities in North Africa; stoning adulterers seems like a way of establishing authority…until it is your sister or daughter who is off to have her face and head pummelled to an unrecognisable jelly by a bunch of teenage boys lead by a perverted and psychotic older man. Ok that analogy is a bit over the top!\nSo the concept of ideas being given greater validity by virtue of who is saying them is something we at a Blue Revolution feel needs to be urgently challenged. Trump falls squarely into this category.\nHowever, there is another objection. The “Billionaire Class”, and they are a class unique among the established classes have their wealth as a result of an all too complex social and economic matrix. The Koch brothers in the |US and we guess “Sir” Phillip Green in the Uk probably wish there was a war on the poor and welfare the dependent. If you like a massive reduction is taxation to allow them to hold on to more of their wealth. What they fail to grasp and the billionaires like Mr and Mrs Mark Zuckerberg and Mr and Mrs Bill Gates grasp is that their wealth is a payment from others to them and only by dint of the free market being “gamed”by governments and vested interests are they billionaires at all. A market that was not mediated or engineered by power and vested interests would not allow the creation of people with such vast wealth and the wealthy have an obligation to recognise that simple fact.\nPeople would not choose to make Phillip Green a billionaire, it happens because the free market has made it possible. We don’t agree with destroying the free market it reflects even in an unregulated form Contract, Choice and Consent and these precious gems need preserving at all cost. We are not naive Red Revolutionaries. Mark Zuckerberg seems to understand all this too and has the modesty to recognise that the wealth he has belongs as much to those who have granted it to him as it does to himself. Hence his desire to give it back not through posturing and preening in a narcissistic demonstration of self-love (or loathing?) but through good deeds. That is a Blue Revolutionary mind at work at the top of the income scale as we toil away in living rooms, studio flats and workshops at the other end.\n23.09.16 As all revolutionaries know, revolution should be evolutionary. So who are the enemy of the Blue Revolution?\nAs any school person knows the march of social progress is, or should be, based on a society moving beyond the constraints of the existing social system and evolving some new structures whilst slowly teasing themselves away from what properly belongs in the past. In modern Britain, for example, we have a major problem. We have the feudal “legal system”; bewigged narcissists, too many of whom remain”public school” have insulated themselves and protected their elevated social status from any form of social movement which is likely to undermine their elevated social, economic and political position. A sort of “Crown Immunity”. They are the enemies of the “blue Revolution”. More a threat than the Corbyn 1970’s Socialists.\nWe try not to name names in a Blue Revolution blog (even though some of us do!) but you only have to look at the legal “brains” behind the “Third way”; the Islington Blairite neo socialists to see they were all Blair and Mrs. Blair’s frequent dinner guests. Newly amongst their number Amal Clooney who whilst doing good works standing up for real victims also dabbles in the post neoclassical nonsence of “human rights”.\nBlair’s posh chums shamefully remain loyal to their “useful idiot”, even to the point of getting him off the hook of war crimes allegations, whilst the same bewigged monsters pursue the honest “Tommy Atkins”; thrown into Blairs “post-neoclassical endogenous….blah ..blah” …PFI war of western reconstruction. Yet being poor, stressed and shot at the ordinary soldier unlike Blair is accused of being guilty of lucrative “human rights” abuses and other “crimes”, according to the Blairite army of lawyers anyway. These parasitic people also make money from the lower ranking “public sector” worker, customs officers, prison and police officers, probation officers, social workers. Why do they do it; because it is their system and they can!!\nIf they wear a wig, hang around British courts and describe themselves as “human rights” lawyers……..they are the parasitic enemy of the Blue Revolution. The enemy of the people. We don’t shoot them or smash up their power bases…we use democracy to stop their activities; we simply stop paying them legal aid……or we will! Are we angry? Yes.\nWe can’t progress beyond “state socialism” however “progressive” the whimpering lefty liberal tells us it is, without clipping the wings of the politico-legal establishment. Reform of the legal system, the army of Judges, barrister, QC’s, solicitors, paralegals, legal executives many paid to needle and antagonise ordinary people in pursuit of their own personal profit and self-aggrandizement and all in the name of the state whom they often serve as politicians too. What the “progressives” don’t get is that “progress” means the end of the “state” as we understand it now. It must become little more than a light touch regulator up holding through a simplified legal and political system the Contract, Choice, and Consent which underpins all civilised societies, with power being devolved to the people.\n25.09.16 If we consider Blair and his legacy why didn’t the “third way” become the “Blue Revolution” thirty years ago?\nSome of us are old enough to remember the landslide New Labour victory of 1997. As Blue Revolutionaries we consider whether the Blair “third way” was a nascent “Blue Revolution” blown off course by global circumstances or whether it was a nieve effort to combine the Public, Private and Charitable sectors in an attempt to re-define a collapsing “capitalist ” system as it morphed into a “consumer based” free market system.\nIt is an article of our faith that the Capitalism drove so much positive change around the globe. It started the process of greater equality for race, gender and culture. It provided the financial pump priming for the health service and a wave of nationalised industries. All brought into existence by a British post-war socialist government. At the same time, the now derided “grammars” were propelling working class boys and girls into the “establishment”. Unfortunately, this working class success resulted in the manipulation of the well-intentioned working class “entryists” into the establishment by the self-interested “old establishment” threatened by real working class success. This brings to an end Grammars thus denying two generations of working class children the opportunity to shape the world for their parents and siblings. They were forced to give way to Blair, Cameron and Clegg. Public school to a man.\nWhilst the British Tory Party popularised the “evil eyes” of Blair in 1997 it was really out of a sense that he was going to slide back to socialism nothing to do with his third way or the perverted version we ended up with. It was never likely that Blair would flip flop back to socialism. Blair was a free marketeer and was comfortable with people being stinking rich. The legacy of Blair is the destruction of Iraq and the Jeremy Corbyn phenomenon. Socialist, Blair certainly was not.\nSo to the point. A Blue Revolution respects the rights of the individual and supports the rights of everyone based very simply on Contract, Choice and Consent. Blair, by contrast, grinned his way into our lives offering “diversity”, a load of sociological woo which set the differences between people ahead of the similarities. “Diversity thus ignored the cultural brutality of denying people and particularly women choice and consent. These simple fundamentals were denied many many migrants. This was because the Blair elite as white liberals turned away from any kind of moral or ideological conflict with cultures that owed their principles to an age when social and economic contributions were gender or caste based. The human rights “industry” upholds rights for too many people, usually men, who don’t believe in rights, particularly gay, women’s or children’s rights. Great work guys; and we pay for this.\nSo the meta-principle of the third way was morally ambiguous. It was secular western but without a moral core defining rights within a moral framework. We could “free trade” and as long as it was legal it was moral. The minorities, of course, reverted back to their own cultural certainties horrified by Blair’s moral ambiguities. He is morally ambiguous as a person too!\nSo this moral ambiguity led to free trade within the economy becoming perverted by personal interest and greed. Like Blair the third promoted the powerful. The government sector was able to manipulate state spending to ensure that the project rewarded those who were seen as the champions of the third way, the business which made profit as jobs were exported to China, Government employees seen as the theocracy of the third way and of course the legal political elite for whom the laws of Human Rights and the EU became a playground for making huge amounts of tax payers money. This is pretty much the governmental and legal context of the “third way”. The social context was Gordon Brown’s welfare reforms which like the “free market” was a consumer facing welfare model. Welfare like the government and legal contexts above was all about maintaining aggregate demand to fulfil the objectives of the post-neoclassical endogenous growth model. This model as we have said before can’t work as spending does not “multiply” investment it simply multiplies consumption with profit and investment being off-shored due to globalisation.\nSo before closing this rather tedious analysis can we explain the differences between the Blue Revolution and the third way. Well yes. A Blue Revolution is not morally ambiguous. It has at its core an absolute commitment to Contract, Choice and Consent. Whilst people or cultures may choose to overlook these principles a government imbued with a Blue Revolution upholds them and only “trades” with other countries who observe them. There can be no freedom if you have no right to consent. Having said that the myth that welfare creates real choice is another piece of nonsense. British working class girls conflicted with too many choices which are “gamed” by welfare are some of the unhappiest in the world. They are expected to work but also encouraged to have babies by the welfare system. These are often babies they don’t want with “men” they don’t want. It isn’t just working class boys who are “failed” by the system. This time, though it’s the welfare as opposed to the education system. Both modern creations of the “third way”.\nThe Blue Revolution does not buy into the idea that “consumption” is a good in itself if it simply provides debt based wealth to government employees (via taxation) and “businessmen” who manufacture tat and sell at a ramped up prices to “consumers”. The market-based economy is built on a false belief that growth can be engineered by debt. This myth benefits the wealthy the lawyers and the politicians. It pays for and promotes a global elite and underpins the “hegemony” that is upheld via the Courts the “human rights industry” and the EU. To start to change this “hegemony” we had to leave the EU. European blue collar workers will thank the British for their radicalism.\nFinally, we don’t believe that people are born equal or can ever achieve equality. However, the elite has created a system which promotes their interests and allows the creation of Phillip Green’s and others. This is reflected in schooling which allows a private sector to flourish and provide jobs in the elite occupations whilst the rest are given a “standard” education in the public sector. To maintain this in the existing system, the selection where it exists is by puzzles and not by encouraging practical skills like spelling and maths. We believe in grammars but also want to get away from selection by puzzle and select by a child’s ability to spell and do maths. This will scare the “elite” as anyone can learn to spell and do times tables and fractions. Coaching to complete puzzles, the gaming of the system to benefit the elite, will end.\nThe third way abolished grammars, abolished morality, promoted debt and debt based wealth, created an elite of lawyers and politicians who ran Britain and Europe in their own image. This model, as Marx suggested, needs to be negated. Is the champion of the Blue collar worker Mrs May up to the job?\n01.10.16 Corbyn’s 21st Century Socialism has only one small problem; there is no role for “socialism” in a place where there is no social or economic value, namely the 21st Century. . But why?\nJeremy Corbyn a kindly old fool who shifts between the startled and absent look of someone out of his depth to the aggressive sloganising student in total control of his loquaciousness, even though to most sane people he is talking absolute rubbish. Well intentioned in a Gordon Brown sort of way but rubbish none the less.\nBut how can we be so sure that socialism has no place in the 21st century? Well, it is very simple really and it comes down to social and economic value. In the heyday of socialism, Britain and the area called the EU were capable of producing both social and economic value. By modern standards, social value is terribly unfashionable; mums at home and dads out at work, low levels of divorce and a genuine love of family and concern for neighbours. It is possible to imagine a 21st-century version of the above but entitlement and welfare sort of pervert the aspiration. High levels of social value reduce the cost of government. This ensures that when economic value is created it isn’t wasted on a public sector coping with a misfiring society due to social unrest, poor public health, high crime, broken families, loneliness……and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, Corbyn and the collection of vulnerable, damaged, misguided and downright dangerous people who currently form the Labour Party’s membership are precisely the people who represent the people from these backgrounds. People for whom a socialist government is a solution to their social unrest or unhappiness as it will resource them and more importantly employ them. Who amongst the socialists, therefore, really wants to see a return to social value.\nThe situation with economic value is even more perverse as we don’t produce any real economic value at all. The “rich” are politicians, lawyers and those who rather than taking tax revenue to make themselves rich, simply rip off the government or rip off the debt-burdened consumer. Socialism in “classical” terms takes surplus value off capitalists and spend it on the people. Today the “capitalist” doesn’t really exist, the business man or woman is dependent upon the debt of others or the debt of the government. We call this debtamorphosis. But when everything is based on debt there is no value for Corbyn and his army of “friends” to acquire. It’s just more debt for the rest of us Jez. Hardly the solution to the problems of the 21st century unless of course, you are stupid or selfish enough to shift the responsibility to those so far unborn who will live in the 22nd century. However, by that time the under-class will be in control and there will be no Contract, Choice and Consent just control coercion and compulsion. If the futures red the future is …….well decide for yourselves, but we believe the Blue Revolution is the only way to save our values, our society, our economy, and our planet!!\n05.10.16 Is Theresa May a Blue Revolutionary? Possibly a bit in some ways but Dave and Co certainly were not. What’s the difference?\nApart from the obvious and disastrous re-engineering of the British financial and housing economics in the style of Blair and Co; a lazy (and ultimately it would have been a doomed) attempt to create growth through the private sector and personal borrowing. All this primed on the basis of Government borrowing engendering the economic confidence necessary for everyone to borrow and keep borrowing. We hope TM understands this is a dangerous model but one that the EU and the west in general is, like a drug addict on heroin, unwilling to abandon. TM also seems to have established some blue collar credentials and seems destined in time to needle the old Blairite establishment of lawyers, and senior public sector boxwallahs. All of the course handsomely remunerated at the public’s expense; or rather at the expense of the public’s debt.\nWhere Blair and Dave and Co however really demonstrate they are part of the dying elite as opposed to the emerging elite of mass political influence or a Blue Revolution as we like to describe it, is in respect of “justice” and in particular that portion of the notion of “justice” which involves the foot soldiers of the declining elite; lawyers. Lawyers like process. They like the process more than outcomes. It doesn’t really matter to a lawyer, and the more senior, the less bothered they are, what happens at the end of a case. Something will happen and lawyers will claim a hefty fee.\nNow Dave sponsored the Saudi Arabian’s as members of some UN human rights quango. It’s the sort of daft stuff Blair at his most deluded would have been capable of doing.We do understand that you have to do work with grubby regimes out of mutual self-interest, but sponsoring them and almost conferring a “human rights” compliant status on them…..well how does that work? It works however because the Saudi’s have “cleaned up their act” and have developed a “human rights compliant process” which would make the lawyers at Doughty Street or Matrix proud. What the Saudi’s do is stone and behead for “crimes” such as “Harlotry” or Adultery, or murder and having put the defendant through a “human rights compliant process” behead them in public.\nNow this process model is seeing all sorts of ordinary people processed in Britain. Of course, British people would not expect to suffer a humiliating death but the modern legal system is all about the process, not the outcome so dangling on the end of a rope is not incompatible with a “humane process” and it’s us the blue collared workers and the unprivileged who may one day find an army of public school educated lawyers more than happy to process us humanely to the gallows. More likely of course if witless Corbyn’s lynch mob take control.\nOur legal friends have created a publicly funded monster that consumes our debt but all too often leaves us, as it did four hundred years ago;speechless.\n07.10.16 Corbyn has more in common with his rebels than he thinks. Is Keir Starmer the “Higgs boson” at the heart of 21st Century “socialism”?\nWe are no friends of reactionary movements; those that out of either stupidity or self-interest hold back progress. Unfortunately, by witlessly promoting the interests of the well healed public sector “supremos”, lawyers and sundry hangers-on, the Labour Party is not as progressive as it would like us to believe it is. In fact, it is not “progressive” at all. It also has poor progressive credentials because of its economically and socially illiterate belief that “poor people” remain morally infantile due to lack of welfare from “Tories” or lack of correct political conditioning. However this infantilism is not generally seen as due to either their diet of sanctimonious amoral welfarism or indeed their manipulation by big business all too keen to flog them rubbish in exchange for their welfare and debt based income. But if viewed by the left as infantile it justifies for both left and right wings an army of welfare experts and a legal system which can simultaneously punish, educate and “protect”. What can be more infantilizing than that! Carry on breeding!\nSo who better to unite the “Blair” left and their handwringing “third way” mumbo jumbo with the lynch mob of the hard left and visceral haters of the “Tories” than a Blair supremo and promoter of all things “public law” and “public sector”; the legal establishment hero and lover of bureaucracy Keir Starmer. This man believes that bureaucracy is alway going to be in the hands of people like him, all politically correct and a necessary bulwark against the “Blue Revolutionary” mob (Brexiteers!). Both the “third-wayers” and the hard left have one or two things in common; a love of nieve diversity programmes, mass immigration and the socialism of the EU perhaps, but absolutely, without doubt, the belief that they must be part of a publicly funded “vanguard” of politically and legislatively intelligent people who like Plato’s philosopher kings are equipped and therefore entitled to rule over the workers. The problem is that the workers have little time for either camp and are becoming increasingly frustrated by both listening to them and more importantly paying for them. Hence Keir’s timely bit of entryism; to protect the interests of the Islingtonian champagne socialists from the hated Tories and the class warriors of labour who might be morally confused by them. He is the left’s Higgs boson discovered in the particle collider of the fractious and chaotic labour movement.\n09.10.16 An anatomy of the West’s anomie; can we live without our “false gods”? V2\nWe will spare any experts a definition of Anomie and will leave the general reader to get out a decent dictionary of psychology for a definition and move onto a look at what the causes of anomie are in the modern western world. We see the world heading in the wrong direction as a result of governments ignoring their responsibility for promoting the social problems that bedevil their populations. At the same time, they watch the decline of civilisation in some parts of this world as for example in North Africa. In other parts of the world regimes consolidate their particular definition of “civilisation” by encouraging a return to a bigoted form of orthodoxy such as we are seeing in parts of “Christian” Africa, the parts of the Middle East which are not war zones and of course the exemplar of religious populism Putin’s Russia.\nWhat these places are doing, which they can do, due to the existence of a latent or not so latent faith-based morality is re-booting it to protect their communities from imploding in the face of global stressors such as poverty, collapsing oil prices, and the encroaching corruption of what we at a Blue Revolution call secular westernism. The western response has been to basically offer as an alternative to this faith-based reaction an offer of cheap debt, bureaucracy and post neo-classical blah blah blah. The “debt” model has the benefit of having an immediate attractiveness, more money, more intervention, and until 2007/8 a seemingly permanent stability. However, let us consider the practical and emotional consequences of each model; to be mischievous we can call them the faith and debt models.\nIn the faith model, people return to bogeyman prejudice against Gays, Jews and anyone else who isn’t culturally incorporated. However, just as in pockets of the US where this is going on at Trump rallies for example (Tumpism is a perverted form of Christianity), people feel good and able to blame someone else for their or their countries woes but there is nothing progressive in store for them. They are being conned of course. Just as Hitler’s working class held out for a Volkswagen if they flogged themselves to death in the run up to World War two, so these duped people around the planet are going to get little if anything from Trump, Putin, or the adoption of brutal Islamic theology. They may, however, be happier than their blue collar equivalents elsewhere (if there is a blue collar equivalent!) and in particular their equivalents in Britain and the EU.\nAmongst certain groups, anomie is prevalent on the continent more so than in the UK. We have examined it comprehensively in the past but it is fair to say that the policy of ghettoising and culturally isolating a migrant population creates a sub-culture who experience a unique anomie they react to it by trying to “purify” the host culture probably out of anger and frustration. By contrast, the British first, second and third and fourth generation migrants are the least likely to suffer anomie; at least by the standards of the indigenous population or indeed populations in the EU, because in the UK they have “in work welfare” supporting them in low waged work (taxi driving, food preparation, warehouse and shop work) but more significantly they have political and social acceptance underpinning their stable family units shored up by a simple, usually Islamic faith. In this respect, they are a valuable asset to Britain which our continental cousins simply cannot culturally or sociologically replicate. As for the white Europeans the indigenous population simply have to look on, neutered by politicians who just like the British left operate with a superior moral framework which views ordinary people’s concerns as small-minded, parochial and bigoted; in other words worth simply ignoring.\nSo what of the white British indigenous population and their anomie? Well white Britain and the US working class like much of the working class in the EU have a particular problem with Anomie. It is evidenced by a disillusionment with mainstream politicians. Working class people are sick of the monochrome lives they have been forced to lead by a political elite who are remote from them and who have no interests in their lives or the economics and social realities which shapes their lives, most notably their debt and insecurity. This causes social decay and crime which the elite “manage” with an army of state operatives.\nBut what is the economic reality which must for us, (we are economic determinists after all) underpin this anomie? Well, firstly the “old socialist” system was based on post-war Government intervening to promote the interests of the blue collar worker. In the Uk, a range of post-war policy making (except abolishing grammar schools) was seen within this social and economic context as “progressive”. Welfare and nationalisations, the NHS and extending educational provision were all good things done by government and paid for by the surplus value misappropriated by capitalists who without the intercession of the government would have kept the wealth for themselves. The death duties levied on the rich after the war helped pay for these progressive policies.\nHowever, this golden era of post-war political consensus has given way to a metastasizing culture of welfare promoting procreation and idleness, human rights devoid of relevance, and an abandonment of personal responsibility as post-war governments sucked up via well-intentioned policies, much of the social morality which both defined and restricted people’s social expectations. It has left the mass of people feeling abandoned by “society” and for too many people the only body that can be blamed for this anomie is the government. This is because for too many people the government is what embodies society, social problems are the responsibility of the government as the concept of society has become largely meaningless. The rich lawyer pursues the squaddie whilst the elderly lose their council services. This is the inherent contradiction of “socialism”; it unavoidably diminishes society and replaces society with government intervention. As the blue collar workers and their offspring stare anomie in the eye, the whole panoply of the state emerges triumphant along with its army of highly paid “leaders”, lawyers and hangers-on.\nHowever, this is not the whole story. British politicians have only just realised anomie exists. This is because politicians have an innate tendency to engage in confirmation bias (to see what they want to see i.e. how respected their views are), and because of the unexpected rise in the Uk of Nigel Farage and Ukip in the last four years, plus the slow relentless decline of the civil engineers of anomie; New Labour. Corbyn is an emotional reaction to anomie but he isn’t part of the solution he remains part of the problem. He is a man of the state! If you don’t believe us listen to him.\nSo what is an economic determinists explanation of all this? What makes our critique “coherent” whilst modern politicians offer a diet of muddle, misunderstanding, utopianism, or all three? Well, this is going to sound like a repeat of stuff we have already said previously. However, we will say it again. The state takes money from the workers and encourages their indebtedness whilst it simultaneously undermines society by promoting unsustainable lives of worthless ignorance. It does this by removing too many real moral choices, choices that make people feel alive as moral agents. As a result of our anomie, we have made ourselves happy with an array of false gods such as consumption, celebrity, sex, money and self-promotion. All this gives rise to pregnant unhappy girls, boys drifting into promiscuity and crime, women being victimised by predatory men whilst men shorn of responsible fatherhood drift into drinking and suicide. The government has been forced to take responsibility for this moral crisis but its solution is to extend the reach of the state further, creating either universal “rights” to lifestyles which the state has decided the taxpaying workers have to pay for (single teenage parenthood, unemployment through obesity), or new “crimes” to control deteriorating moral behaviour (coercion or stalking). The workers have to pay for the army of state workers and lawyers who maintain this alienating hegemony we have no choice. We would describe this as the publicsectocracy using debtamorphosis to maintain the alienating power of the state which itself maintains and promotes the people’s anomie. Our analysis is grounded in sound economics and is not “utopian” because western culture is first and foremost economically bankrupt and this precedes its moral bankruptcy.\nFor us the critical questions are these; do the public know what they are feeling is anomie and what is their appetite to abandon their false gods of consumption, sex and self-interest? Moreover what is the government’s appetite to reign in its army of publicsectorcrats and re-build real social morals even if it slows or even chokes off increasing consumer demand and the expansion of the power of the state.\n11.10.16 Having consolidated, the “remainers” and our friend Sir Keir are clearly intent on derailing “Brexit”\nWe have argued before that the “real” establishment are the lawyers. Lawyers in politics wield more power and have access to structures, a vocabulary and vested interests which can only promote the state funding of law and the extension of the state. This is to ensure the state’s moral and legal hegemony and protect it from the interests of the mob. Unfortunately when it is time for society to move on this reactionary group act as self-interested counter-revolutionaries. Whether it is Clinton in the US or the Blairs and their entourage of supporters in the Barristers Chambers of Islington, the progress of Britain, the EU and the world generally is not going to be promoted one jot by these men and women who like the Sheriffs and overlords of the fifteenth century owe their living to the patronage of the state.\nLawyers more than businessmen and women represent the interests of the past. They always have done, but whereas “the capitalist” model could be accommodated by our bewigged lawyers and judiciary; because the capitalists became increasing wealthy and therefore able to pay for law which reflected their interests, the legal class now must fight or rather manipulate the government and legislature in parliament to preserve their particular brand of professional self-interest. Lucky for them there are lots of lawyers in Parliament. The reason is quite clear to us; the state sector with its army of committee members, employees, processes, policies and hangers-on have replaced the capitalist “business” hegemony with a governmental one. It is a command and control structure albeit fairly benign thus hard to overthrow in revolutionary terms, ideal, therefore for lawyers who like process. This hegemonic structure is not just British it is replicated across the west and just like during the trauma of past revolutions the power brokers within this hegemony whilst claiming “progressive” values are essentially conservative in character. Just like an alcoholic who “can’t see a problem with another one” our legal establishment can’t see the inherent injustice in their own socialist state model. It is coherent and self-contained within its own terms of reference, however, it shamefully reflects the interests of this public sector governing class and not the interests of the people who’re paying wages, debt, and limited life chances pay for it.\nSo with Britains Blue Collar revolution catching these “elite” people out by demanding a change in the way Britain is governed and an uncoupling from the lactating sow of the EU, they have been forced to consolidate. We can see now that these reactionaries self-promoting and counter-revolutionary values fly in the face of the democratic instincts and decent values of the British people. Sir Keir Starmer is probably at the vanguard of the forces of the status quo brought in by the witless Corbyn to take on the “hated Tories”. We see with Clegg, Milliband and others the anti-democratic instincts of the British socialist establishment taking human form. All will claim moral superiority and a patronising disregard for the will of the people and all are like the battling Cavaliers fighting against the natural flow of history; the Blue Revolution. If only our media and other opinion formers could see these people the way we do. If they did, perhaps they would start to see the current economic ups and downs as the birth pains of a new genuinely progressive global economic and social landscape and then they might stop catastrophising this important process of change.\nPredicting the near future we anticipate that Project fear will re-emerge and “project unconstitutional government” will be developed probably by Starmer. But ultimately the world of the elite politician undermining the lives of the workers with a diet of immorality funded by debt and promoted and protected by law will we hope start to end once we leave the EU. Oh and we think Her Majesty the Queen is probably with us on all of this!\n12.10.16 Capitalism in crisis? Capitalism no longer exists but the “free market” certainly isn’t totally free or an open market!\nWe get bored trying to explain why we no longer have “capitalism”but still the media pundits and of course the “left” insist on using a term which had probably lost all its relevance by 1950. In the UK the programme of nationalisations and the bankruptcy of heavy industry after the war rendered any notion of “capitalists” stalking the economy exploiting workers by paying them a pittance and then “stealing” the value they created with the sweat of their brow and the toil of their hands frankly ridiculous. However the left need to persuade their misguided sad and deluded followers that such monsters still exist. Socialism is you see essentially parasitic on “Capitalism” and so Corbyn needs to promote its existence. Without “capitalism” there is no socialism. And that, as they say, is the left wings problem. Of course, the Blairites and the legal and intellectual socialists know the class war is over but they can’t accept the end of the post-war socialist experiment. This is because their wages and status as members of the publicsectocracy rely on a docile “working class” over whom they administer a debt based state funded welfare benevolence. Don’t they all look smug when they talk about how benign they are?\nThe problem for the “left” and “right” wings of the Labour party in the UK or the Democrats in the US, however, is that the traditional relationships within the economy which funded government spending in the past is no longer able to fund government spending today. So as we have argued previously the economy has become debt based with “confidence” being the currency that loosens up borrowing and spending to maintain aggregate demand. The Bank of England and the last UK government were both obsessed with “consumer confidence” that is because the current economic model is based on it.\nThe immorality in this model and where the right wing socialist is probably more knowingly immoral than their thick left-wing counterpart is that they are intent on preserving a system that pays them well out of working class people’s debt and taxes. This model undermines society in general. It does this by preventing a cheap public collective morality re-establishing itself; people leave too many things to the state. It also promotes the power of the state; a system of laws, rules and regulations which are less and less able to deliver care, support, responsibility and common sense, but which encourages debt, divorce, illegitimate children, promiscuity, declining mental and emotional health, crime and social alienation.\nThe rules of the state’s model prevent any collective action or in reality “choice”as when the state comes in the front door, contract, choice and consent leave by the back window. The reasons are complex but essentially the public sector model like the old capitalist one is always struggling to preserve itself in the face of demands to change (progressive change!). This translates into the obstruction of social progress. The “socialists” brought the “capitalists” to heel but who brings the “socialist public sector model” to heel now? This is highly relevant when the state is so large, so indebted and with social obligations and pensions outstripping the ability to fund them. Mrs May possibly? Corbyn, or Milliband or the Lib Dems; no chance. These left wing parties are essentially counter- revolutionary. They wish to preserve the awesome power of the state even in the face of the impossibility of this being achieved without collective pain on a national scale.\nSo with no real capitalism, people’s debt being won and lost by governments or free marketeers as though it is winnings in a casino game; what is to become of a western society that is slowly being alienated to the point of bloody revolution? Unless of course the media elite, academics, lawyers and politicians of the centre wake-up and smell the Blue Revolutionary coffee, things don’t look very good to us.\nHowever, the situation could be improved with little upheaval. Intergenerational affection needs to be valued again; people who have “value” such as their own home should share it with the young. The State is failing to deliver on too many fronts. Having taken on “social care” it offers costly indifference. People should have to “choose” to have children not simply be subsidised to have them by a state that doesn’t understand that the real “cost” of children is emotional not financial. The public is prevented from realising they are the biggest threat to the NHS by politicians who dishonestly trade insults which ignore the appalling health of the nation.\nIn addition to the “social value” described above the whole modern economy of renting, platforming, zero hours contracts needs to be tackled and tackled hard; not colluded with so as to exclude people from operating fairly in these “free markets”. The law is being used to exclude small operators from the free market, increase inequality and increase the interests of “big market players”. We are only just starting to research the modern economic marketplace, but if we had more social value underpinning people’s lives (and less government) the modern free market may not be that scary and it is flexible enough to ensure everyone can find a place within it.\n16.10.16 Contract, Choice and Consent the jewels of the western world: how safe are they with Corbyn’s Socialism? V2\nThe west has progressed through many social and economic phases and has now gone beyond capitalism a phase which created revolutionary ideas such as workers right to Contract, Choose and Consent. However, post-capitalism is now at a point where it has experienced the elevation and consolidation of the power of the State. Whether in the US or the UK some politicians represent the progress of this now timed out model; these politicians and hangers on are the “Publicsectocracy” . The original intention of the state’s involvement in the economy was quite rightly to “tame” the self-interested capitalists; who were indifferent to the suffering of the “free to contract” workers for whom in reality there was little freedom.\nWhere a country was in the grip of an early social and economic model (tribalism, feudalism) the process of colonisation created initially in theory, but then moving into practice the widespread rights associated with capitalism; Contract, Choice and Consent. Capitalism was needed to enable these countries to trade. Capitalism increased the productive capacity of the colonised countries too, reducing starvation and uncertainty. Uncertainty and starvation are the characteristics of earlier social and economic models.\nThis legacy, the legacy of capitalism, meant that by the 20th-century women had rights previously denied them, discrimination went from being not merely distasteful but wholly unacceptable. Eventually, homosexuality became legal as countries started to recognise the implications of capitalism’s legacy; namely that people were factors of production free to contract, having rights that were based on Contract Choice and Consent to maximise productive capacity. These economic rights transcend social prejudice. It is the legacy of early social reformers and much later, western socialism that these capitalist economic and social rights were made widely available to ordinary workers.\nSo what of the modern left wing and particularly Corbyism and what if anything relevant is going on in the US? Well having said that the driving home of capitalism’s “troika” of rights was the legacy of social reformers and mid 20th-century socialists, should we be celebrating the rise of Corbyn, Momentum and his army of avid and loyal supporters? Sadly we at a Blue Revolution think not. Corbyn is first and foremost a man of the state. Like many of his avid followers he has a superficial grasp of economics and in particular Marxist economics and therefore believes that the state can promote progress. In this, he is no different from the Lib Dem’s and Tim Farron, and Blairites such as Keir Starmer. However, whereas these “progressive” politicians are simply misguided because they naively believe in the power of the state to do good, Corbyn sees the state as in instrument of settling on the UK domestic front a now non-existent class war and globally he supports the pre-eminence of any ant-western ideology. These anti-western ideologies remain unreformed by capitalism’s legacy of Contract, Choice and Consent so are at their core cruel, discriminatory (against gays and women, people of the wrong tribe or faith). Unfortunately, these anti-western ideologies are mainly tribal and totalitarian (in Marxian terms totalitarian is basically feudal) so the prejudices which they promote thanks to capitalism’s legacy, the west has become “grown up about”.\nNow, this capitalism we refer to no longer exists; it did its best work three or more hundred years ago. Social reformers refined its more brutal bi-products and we now enjoy its legacy. However, the change needed to reform capitalism, required the intervention of the state. The state and its army of politicians, lawyers and hangers-on; the publicsectocracy, have, like the Clintons in the US and the Blairites and Cameroons in the UK failed to recognise that the job is largely done and it is they now who use the state to serve their own interests. They should return more power to the people, reassured that Contract, Choice and Consent are now embedded in British and western culture and are only compromised by immigration from cultures which do not share or even understand these basic cultural values.\nHowever whilst the benign publicsectocracy, clings on to the ideology of the state as core to people’s lives thus making people pay for the privilege of having them in charge, in the case of Corbyn and his lynch mob there is no benign misunderstanding; the state is there to acquire power, hold power and pursue an ideology that provides a safe haven for beliefs that last saw the light of day in the west before the advent of capitalism. In other words, Corbyn, Seamus Milne and John McDonnell have more in common with Presidents Putin and Assad, various torturers and head choppers than they do with the vast majority of decent British democrats and workers, who whilst frustrated by what the public sector has become don’t want to return to a feudal system with the state and its apparatus in charge bullying them, taxing them and possibly killing them in the name of preserving Corbyn’s compromised and contaminated “internationalist” ideology.\n16.10.16 We have had a meeting and we want to know; what is the Corbynite “left” up to? Here are our ideas.\nIt is very easy to take the Corbyn left at face value. Native grassroots socialists and gullible journalists swallow the democratic and egalitarian agenda hook, line and sinker! However, some things have made our largely crusty bunch of proto-Marxians question the motives of the elite champagne socialists who are pretenders to the Conservatives as a government in waiting. What do the “left” really think about Blue Collar Britain and are we, the Blue Collar Britons, safe in their hands? We think not.\nWe have said in many earlier posts that socialism is the inevitable intervention of the state within the workings of the capitalist system. A system which liberated people from the enslavement of feudalism but which gave advantages to the capitalists who exploited the worker. Trades Unions and the Labour movement were necessary counterweights to the awesome power of the capitalist system. To its eternal credit the combination of liberal Christion faith and liberal economics drove levels productive capacity which before capitalism could never have been imagined. Feeding continents! Technological innovation, equality, democracy and freedom all followed in the wake of the capitalist revolution. The first Bue Revolution. The socialist negation of the raw capitalist system was, without a doubt, necessary. However, the socialist system was a transitional phase not a phase to be embedded and promoted to advantage a new class of the elite. The problem with Corbyn’s Labour party is that whilst he may be a well-intentioned witless lightweight, the people around him including Milne and Chakrabarti are well into the idea of using their elite position to personally advantage themselves with little regard to the people who pay for their pre-eminence; namely us, the workers! They take advantage of the education that is available to the elite because they are the elite. Socialism’s dirty secret is that it has spawned an elite even worse than the old money class-based elite. The new elite look down their nose at people who don’t have their values, but not those who don’t have their wealth or education. They like the underclass; it’s how they justify their caring credentials, caring as long as they get well paid to “care”. Oh and the proles fall into line when expected to do so.\nSo we see references to Brexiters being “thick” we hear “Tories” being reviled as the left camouflage their own advantage and attempts to consolidate it by picking on what they see as the money elite (bad) as opposed to their ideological AND money elite (good). Of course, all this social advantage is paid for by the taxpayer and borrower. It is this which makes “Lady” Chakrabarti, Milne and so many others on every spectrum of the left more immoral than even the worst Tory grandee.\nFinally a point about education. Chakrabarti sends her kid to a posh school. What this does is enable this kid to get access to other privileged young people, but more importantly it confers the language and confidence of inclusion into the elite; something Labour….Socialist Labour, wish to deny to those who pay them; again us! We get comprehensive and no Grammars so they consolidate via private education. Why would anyone support this bunch of frauds, what we need is a Blue Revolution, not a red one!\n17.10.16 The use of the divorce metaphor is apt for Brexit. The UK is the abused female spouse who wants to get out but who is going to get a “bit of fist” first..\nThe phrase a “bit of fist” refers to the old practice in the midlands counties of the UK of beating a wife who is believed to be disloyal, dishonouring or disobedient. It is the behaviour of the brute and in some communities still goes on even today. However, the Brexit debacle highlights the trend of remainers to give Britain a good hiding or at least threaten it, and in the case of the EU to actually to have the power to deliver the punishment.\nWe all find this deeply disturbing. There is no justification for locking anyone into a dysfunctional relationship. This “arranged marriage” was probably doomed to fail as the elites of the EU carved up a deal to make the project “work”. The UK got banking and finance, Germany got manufacturing industry and the French got agriculture. All preserved by a cosy arrangement that has ultimately denied Africa agricultural development and has locked all 28 countries into an unholy alliance or “customs area” as it is euphemistically called buying stuff the Germans make, paid for by British arranged finance and all fed or perhaps “watered” by the French. The world suffers because the EU has decided it wants to do well by trading with itself\nOf course, the eventual failure is guaranteed…ten…fifteen years from now this deeply flawed continental business model will collapse under what Marx called the weight of its inherent contradictions. Basically, the debt to value ratio almost guarantees the collapse of the whole system. And of course, immigration and welfare can’t be ignored either. Ony a fool would want to be married to this oaf of a business model.\nSo when Remainers are bleating on about Brexit they need to think about global trade and in particular the role of global trade healing the world and bringing peace by spreading a business model based on Contract, Choice and Consent to places in the world that are familiar only with coercion, control and corruption. Remainers are shamelessly counter-revolutionary and just like the arranged marriage that fails we all need to move on and remain friends rather than dishing out a “bit of fist”.\n18.10.16 1 Billion pounds wasted on “troubled families”! Well who would have thought that would happen? But the question is; does social justice have to involve social and economic waste?\nSocial and economic justice are two sides of the same coin. But in public-sector controlled Britain does the solution to asymmetrical economic advantage have to involve government naivety and a wasted budget of £1Bn. We look at “social and economic justice”. They are very connected but have been separated for “political” reasons for too long.\n“Justice” isn’t just about crime and punishment indeed this association comes some way behind the justice of economic advantage and disadvantage. Unfortunately for people today the government and their public school, classically educated advisers have no clue as to how their lofty social positions both underscore economic disadvantage but also their ideas offend the working person’s notion of justice in its broadest sense.\nYou may ask; how so? Well firstly the advisors are well educated and as a result well paid within the comforting security of the public sector. A security that the rest of us don’t enjoy but, and here is the rub, we pay for. They can scan the social environment from their detached social and economic positions simultaneously being both “kept” by the state but also tasked to critique the lives of others “kept” by the state. The difference is the wealth or asymmetrical nature of the wealth between the assessed and the assessors. This probably explains the preoccupation with money as the key to solving the “troubled families” issue. Giving people who waste money on drink and drugs, tattoos etc more money and stuff, doesn’t seem like much of a well……….good call. Only a well educated isolated and remote group could come up with the idea that money, that root of all evil, could solve this intergenerational, complex yet seemingly intractable problem. It is a problem that affects immigration, social and political opportunity for the poor, and ultimately getting the right people into the influential jobs, regardless of background. It really isn’t the case that only the posh, well-educated or wealthy should determine social policy.\nWe have said it before we need an army of foster carers to promote the interests of the offspring of the poor in the face of the patronising incompetence of the well educated wealthy public sector elite as reflected in the “troubled families initiative”. 1 Bn should do it but only if spent in the right way and not the “troubled families”way.",

Living the dream of “smashing the hated Tories” decades after the Tories stopped being a threat to anyone but themselves. Corbyn really believes he has set the country on fire with his skilled orations. In reality though his supporters have no idea what is really going on, who is shafting who and what they should do about it. So they buy into the simplicities of 1970’s “socialism” because it is a familiar blast from the past for many, and beats returning to pot smoking or thinking for yourself. Get the megaphone out and chant “what do we want…..the Tories out…..when do we want it……NOW!” It’s a great way to stay fit and get some fresh air in middle age. For the Facebook generation it’s simply about shifting their debt onto the States books.\nOne thing Comrade Corbyn did get right however was that politics has drifted the “centre ground” to the left….He isn’t totally stupid. However the Tories having moved left don’t really have the intellectual heft to understand why they have had to do that. They think it is because Corbyn’s ideas are so compelling, to stand any chance of power in the future the gravity of politics has to move towards Corbyn. Of course this is nonsense.\nPolitics moved the centre ground to the right under the hated Blair and stayed right through Brown and Cameron emerging still right wing but failing under Mrs May. Up until the managerial Mrs May, there was a beautiful planetary alignment which saw a rather silly ideology consolidate around a handful of right wing simplicities. Most notable of these simplicities was a belief in the power of the liberated free market to deliver economic and social justice through personal and government debt.\nOf course not only could an unregulated free market not deliver social justice, the economics of this system were brutal too, as the bottom 50% of the population saw their jobs disappear abroad, their wage levels pushed to the minimum wage by waves of unskilled migration, and their personal debt rocket to pay for an empty meaningless lifestyle which subsidised the top 50% with income from the poorer peoples personal debt.\nThis people is the most immoral system ever created by man. A system where the poor are forcibly indebted by their government to pay for a wealthy elite. It is slavery in all but name.\nHowever the miserable saga doesn’t end there. Blair and Cameron and Osborne were convinced that this post industrial economic system would work. But of course it has to feed some kind of value in to support the debt and that value was the fluctuating value of stock and property which even when cleverly packaged as a “collateralised debt obligation” still failed the sniff test. Hence the aftermath in 2007/08\nSo with the western economic model still failing under the assumed auspicious conditions of the right….the only possible option for the average person is that there maybe something on the left that can sort out the obvious fact that Anglo Saxon economics is finished. And so we have Jeremy and his happy band of conned and deluded students and overweight 1970’s and 1980’s student activists complete with megaphones tempted back to perform angry protest. A sort of new Angry Brigade, all primed and ready to do business sorting out the system. But this will be by getting the poor old taxpayer into more debt whilst looking after the interests of the Labour party, its supporters and interest groups.\nSo what does Blue Revolution make of all this. Well we believe the western model is to coin a phrase a house built on sand. There is no way of avoiding the stark truth of that and so we need to stop talking politics based on parties and have a democracy based on realism, not short term party self interest.\nWe can’t afford the modern British state. The political Parties all want to run the State but they can’t, it’s unaffordable, unfit for purpose and needs massive reform. They can’t do that reform. The Left wing and the right wing have no suggestions as to how we can save our country and our culture so our country and culture are seriously at risk from them.\nOh and people wonder why there is an increase in Anti Semitism in the Labour Party. Apart from the religious composition of Northern Constituencies the reason is that they know that their policy of debt and more debt won’t solve the West’s or Britains problems and will only make matters significantly worse. Who do you blame when you have actually made matters worse, perhaps existentially worse. Well you don’t blame yourself or the people who vote for you…you blame mankind’s Shylock, Fagin or money lender….you blame the Jews. It was never your borrowing that is to blame….it was their lending! That is even if Jewish business still run the banks. Our guess is they got out of banking years ago!\nSo what of the party conferences. Well they have both reflected the shift left from Blairs shift right. But neither party has an answer as the answer is less of them and more of a State run democratically by people with the values morals and skills to do it properly in everyone’s interest. Not simply the short term party interest!",

We proposed a show similar to “Eden” some four years ago which took people from the stone age to phone age and in doing so tried to capture the “moral progress” that occurred as we gained mastery over our environment. Most fundamental to this progress are women’s rights. Channel 4’s “Eden” seems to confirm our view that when economies go wrong it is women’s rights that go to the wall first. Margaret Atwood made the same point in “The Handmaids Tale”. For an economy to have a progressive future it has to be grounded in an activity that creates real distributable value and is not simply some kind of equity release scheme operated on a global scale by a political and financial elite.\nEconomics needs explaining to ordinary people who even under old economic paradigms struggled to understand where wealth came from. The reason we believe that a new economic instruction manual is necessary is that the “new economics” is dependent on financial services and financial services rely on asset value to underpin their activities. As we saw with the 2007/8 crash if those assets suddenly reveal themselves to be worthless then we are going to be in very big trouble again.\nBut what of Mr Carney, the high priest of the “Reminers” suddenly getting all optimistic about post-Brexit Britain. To us, his optimism highlights the continuity that will be necessary post Brexit and which the EU won’t be able to dismantle. How so? Well, Britain is not a fabulously rich country we have too much debt to be wealthy in the traditional sense of the term, however, we are to the world’s investors a fabulously well-endowed country with property and land holdings worth about sixty trillion dollars.\nNow assuming that the Tories don’t skewer free movement and upset the housing and land asset inflation apple cart Britain will continue to prosper financially post-Brexit. The worlds investment dosh will still flow here! The problem for the Tories is that it was the issue of migration that was the prime reason for the working classes to vote Brexit, and we hoped that post-Brexit immigration would be curtailed (by the loss of welfare entitlements) so as to take the inflationary pressure out of the housing and land asset bubble and perhaps re balance the economy by encouraging other sectors.\nIt seems clear to us this is not going to happen. Carney’s optimism is a symptom of that. Britain will continue to rely on the Kleptocracy to fund the levers of state and pay for the publicsectocracy and the workless army of the welfare and healthcare dependent citizens who are on the books of the state.\nAs economic determinists, we believe so much flows from this economic model which is assumed to be permanent. Take away the slosh of money washing around in this model and what you have left is nothing. With this nothing will disappear all the rights and freedoms we enjoy now. Even Jeremy Corbyn won’t be able to borrow himself out of that situation there will be little of real value to borrow against.\nThe good news is it is a while off yet, but with the Western worlds house built on sand rather than rock, the end it is coming!",

The left wing, however, have no basis for their belief in social Progress other than it makes them feel nice when they think about it.\nThe problem for the traditional left, that collection of well-intentioned muddle heads who promote progress at State level whilst presiding over the growth of ignorance and squalor at the social level, is that their version of progress lacks economic fundamentals. It is thus simply utopian wishful thinking bankrolled by debt and state expenditure. The model deployed by the kleptocrats of the free market is based on debt underpinned by inflated asset values. The left doesn’t seem to even have this flawed model to deliver their “progress”.\nWe put it on record that the western hegemony will end and without a revolutionary overhaul of the State and its responsibilities and the public and their responsibilities too, the existing state, banking and political structures when they collapse will take our rights and freedoms with them. To us, it almost feels as though the elites are planning for this eventuality and so they have created places like Dubai as bolt holes.\nThe reality is of course that the nature of the revolutionary overhaul is as obvious to us as the tensions and contradictions within the western system itself. Basically, there is too much debt, too much planet wasting consumption, too much inequality based on wealth management as opposed to value creation (the old capitalist way!). This new western model feeds a free market that marketizes, well whatever. It globalises human activity into poor and productive or poor and redundant depending on what the elite can get away with paying. In the west, the redundant become an underclass whose function all too quickly becomes to consume and reproduce with little real hope of escaping this entrapping lifestyle.\nThe revolutionary change promoted by us will involve extending democracy to a much wider group of actual legislators, such as our legislative college or peoples chamber. The identification of contract and consent as the basis for all adult human relationships….(no good if you want to promote a brand of feudalism like the Saudi’s or North Koreas), and finally a State which puts the needs of the people before the needs of certain elite groups of the people as is the case now. This final point will require a small state that regulates and doesn’t control and a cheap system of civil law which deals with most disputes apart for serious injurious criminality.\nWe thus have two visions of the west in the 22nd century. One is our optimistic view of an economy where everyone creates modest amounts of social and economic value and shares it around and the other our up to our neck in shark filled waters view which is that the elite will bask in the sunshine of Dubai whilst controlling the rest of us remotely via a mean gruel of welfare and autocracy. The type; Saudi, Chinese or North Korean is too early to determine and of course, the rights of one-half of the population will be affected to a greater extent than the other. It’s what happens when you return to primitivism.",

Should we develop the hub of global history ?\nIs this a daft idea or isn’t it? It depends like most things on perspective. To the unenlightened, the question might be about what exactly is Boston’s role in any hub of world history. Others may argue that the history itself is shaming and should not be celebrated.\nWe believe that Britain in the 17th and 18th century laid down the global foundations of what was essentially a liberal bourgeois revolution. It was this revolution more than anything else which established freedom based on the commercial freedoms of Contract, Choice and Consent. These commercial freedoms have legitimately acquired a social character and therefore define our lives in a positive and liberating way. They underpin the politics of identity.\nIf we care enough to look we can see where these freedoms are absent and if we are clever enough we can see how the absence of these freedoms distorts societies or distinct communities within society, restricting rights for many including women and the poor.\nThe economic and religious freedoms that the Pilgrim Fathers and celebrated Bostonians took to America (from Plymouth, not Boston just to be accurate)laid the foundation for the Capitalist powerhouse that became the USA. Whilst these freedoms are not sufficient to create a just society you can’t have a just society without them. They are therefore an essential ingredient of any nation that wants to call itself “free”.\nSo in the age of the internet and the decline of the town centre, Boston like the whole of Britain needs to work on it’s global narrative its Unique Selling Point, and place itself foursquare at the heart of one of the most transformational periods in world history, the revolution in freedom delivered to the world in the 17th and 18th century by Briton’s and Bostonians alike.\nBoston’s contribution to the world can be drawn on a flowchart of world history and can be linked to other British towns and foreign nations.

A difference in values between the ‘ideology’ of Islam and ‘western values’. How can you help?\n3rd June 2018\nThe Rt Hon James Brokenshire\nSecretary of State for Housing\nCommunities and Local Government\n2 Marsham Street London SW1P 4DF\nDear Secretary of State\nOne issue which is causing ordinary people great concern and is clearly not being addressed within communities is associated with the high numbers of people of the Muslim faith living in concentrated areas of inner cities. There are many challenges arising from this development some of which may be reflected in attitudes towards other faiths. There, therefore, appears to be little integration as the “British way of life” is seemingly Haram to many observant Muslims.\nHaving reviewed what may be behind the creation of a form of separate development, it seems to us that there have been a number of reports which have been significant in the past and continue to exert influence over the behaviour of Public Sector organisations and we believe this impedes the development of a shared set of twenty-first century values.\nThe Parekh Report published by the Runnymede Trust in 2000, the Mc Pherson Report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the Runnymede Trust consultation into “Islamophobia” have in our view all resulted in unintended consequences that are impacting on communities now.\nTaking each, in turn, the Parekh report was comprehensive, well researched and influential. It fixed the policy expectations that were considered necessary to deliver a safe harmonious multicultural Britain in the new Millenium. It was culturally Marxist in its emphasis on prejudice, discrimination exclusion and inequality, as opposed to being class-based. However, the upshot of such top-down engineering is that it presupposes that the solution to important issues can be delivered by government and public sector policy.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that the report did make the following percipient comment “The need for both equality and difference and to respect the rights of both individuals and communities appears to be beyond the compass of existing political vocabularies. The debate about British multiculturalism needs to pursue these long-term questions. It has hardly begun”\nWe would argue it has never started. This inability to meet the demands of equality and difference has established we believe a culture of organisational paranoia about the negative role in which organisations see themselves having unintentionally reinforced prejudice. As a result in places like Rochdale organisational fear and the absence of the ‘shared core values and human rights culture’ advocated by Parekh led the abuse of vulnerable white girls. This unintended consequence is now leading to anger being directed at the State by ordinary working people and their anger is both justified and understandable. If a report promotes a set of policy suggestions of a legal and procedural nature with vague suggestions about “values” that are not adopted by all communities and children are harmed, people will be moved to anger.\nIn respect of the Runnymede Trust Commission on Islamophobia in 1997, it identified a ‘mad’ view of Islam by westerners and came up with eight ways that groups with opposing views could overcome prejudice. For example, seeing groups as different but having equal worth, as opposed to seeing groups as violent etc.\nThe problem with this method is that it has been adopted by liberal western groups and yet the failure to adopt this method of mutual understanding by grassroots Muslims has resulted in a failure of dialogue at street level. It is sadly a commonly held view that Western culture is haram! The effect is that there has been a general retreat from dialogue at community level unless publicly funded schools are taking non-Muslim children to mosques. There is, therefore, a general reinforcement of separate development. This phenomenon has not assisted the aftermath of Rochdale. Communities simply do not widely share the same values and clearly have no desire so to do. The Islamic faith contains many values at odds with many of those of the twenty-first century West with little mutual respect particularly in respect of the treatment of women and girls.\nFinally, the report into the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence identified institutional racism within the police. The allegation of police racism continues to cause problems in communities today. If prejudice, discrimination, exclusion and inequality are identified with public bodies as suggested by Parekh then those bodies like Police and Local Authorities will fail to serve their communities. They will and do operate to politically safeguard themselves from the possibility of charges of racism by the government or overt Political Correctness from the press.\nCurrently, knife crime and gang violence are establishing primitive values that are totally at odds with values compatible with the twenty-first century and little is being done to address it. Is there a “Queen’s Peace” in our inner cities?\nIf it is as stated that these issues remain beyond current ‘political vocabularies’ then it is urgent that action is taken. We would urge Her Majesty’s Government to consider a wide-ranging commission and consultation at all levels of society exploring the issue of community integration. There must be no hiding from harsh realities like faith justified abuse that has become established in some communities nor the social failure in white working-class communities that has created many of the victims. We need to have an open and transparent debate before the differentiation of communities, the lack of shared values; (the ambition of Parekh) starts to cause a generalised breakdown of moral cohesion.\nYours sincerely\nTG\nOn behalf Blue Revolution",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_its-so-backward-its-awkward-the-working-peoples-west-and-islam-in-the-21c/content_184.html": "7C Islam in the 21C working people’s West.\nWe all find certain things embarrassing, ‘Chuggers’, Mormons, Scientologists, Hasidic Jews, “happy-clappy” Christians, and Morris men. But no one wants them to stop enjoying their lives. In the 21st century, we want everyone to enjoy their lives in peace. But we might shuffle away as they approach.\nIslam, of course, goes back to the 7th century. Its values reflect a period in history when brutality and indifference to pain characterised much of the world. The difficulty of making money and creating capital in Arabia and in the rest of the Islamic world from the 7th century onwards limited its ability to progress economically and therefore it was unable to progress socially. We are economic materialists after all.\nModern social progress is a product of capitalist success. In a nutshell the ability of a new middle class to acquire capital from the labour power of others via contract’s rather than slavery or serfdom. This eventually gave the world the principles of Contract, Choice and Consent which in turn drove the demand for these economic principles to take on social character and form the 18th-century democracy that we still have today, and which has gone around the world via the British Empire.\nUntil recently in the West gender relationships were historically unequal. But male and female rights eventually succumbed to the democratising juggernaut of capitalism. Capitalism was back then, as the free market is today indifferent, to the background, sex and race, sexuality, gender identity and faith. Sexual inequality was required socially not economically. In capitalism, its only injustice is its inherent economic unfairness, rich or poor.\nWorkers of the western world who have lived in the capitalist system and seen their rights extended within it will have a solid grasp that whilst capitalism is an unfair system, some win and some loose, it has created a very broad and far-reaching equality. There is little discrimination in capitalism as the principles of capitalism have no role for discrimination. Discrimination is bad for business.\nSo, into this well established economic and social environment come a large group of people for whom the egalitarianism of capitalism is in some cases alien. Many harbouring a 7th-century belief system founded on their holy book the Koran, and the Hadith, which reflects the economic necessities of their day, for example, the different treatment of women, homosexuals or those of different faiths.\nThe penalty for breaking the rules in all simple agrarian and impoverished cultures is similarly harsh. Stoning, beheading, beating are all promoted in Holy books and by some of the followers of faiths and denominations today. The clash of cultures, therefore, can’t be more real between those who live by the experience of the liberal West and those who hold traditional “faith” based views. There is little to unite these groups culturally. If one accepts submission and control it’s difficult to grasp the role of contract, choice and consent.\nIt takes a while to compartmentalise and set aside one’s own irrational bias before one can come up with a possible explanation for this phenomenon of some in the West promoting what are largely un Western values. Once you reflect on the theology and psychology involved in dealing on a personal level with the traditional values in Islam, for example, it becomes easier to see that we are basically uncomfortable about the whole situation and don’t recognise the relevance of Islamic values in the 21st century. It is hard to see how someone who believes in equal rights for all with no discrimination on gender or grounds of sexuality can find any common ground within what is presented as the Islamic faith today. There will, of course, be people of the Islamic faith who accept the values of the Enlightenment but the Holy book and Hadith are claimed to be the infallible instruction from God and Muhammad, so the challenge can’t be underestimated.\nThe internet has examples of the faithful from all faiths explaining the approach to various issues from the vantage point of their faith. So it raises the question what can one really say to an earnest young man who would like to see girls married at the age of 8? or the dress code for men and women that is intended to set aside equality between the sexes and may indeed feed male entitlement? Or the issue of unofficial street praying or the publicly expressed demand for this punishment or that practice. It is uncomfortable having to make sense of these differences in opinion and perspective in the twenty-first century. When confronted by the unreformed value base of all faiths but specifically Islam it makes those with modern values behave in an oddly incoherent way, so we can avoid dealing with it.\nThe solution is not that difficult to imagine. At every social, legal and political level it should be acknowledged that some ideas are just basically incompatible with the modern world whether it be restricting reproductive rights for women or the demand for Sharia councils. Because these ideas are well out of date in the 21st century the advocates of these ideas make us feel uncomfortable and we shy away from a debate. We should not. The days of neo-colonial toleration of the sort that doesn’t challenge ideas must stop as under the auspices of faith and for some within the faith community, we find FGM, circumcision and other forms of harm. There is nothing wrong with feeling uncomfortable about someone else’s idea, it’s not illegal…..yet!\nOne final point is this. We are where we are because we too have out of date institutions on us namely our near-universal western 18th-century political system. This system will never reflect the rights of working people but whilst we must continue to shout to keep our 18th-century progressive values, of contract, choice and consent, we must fight to change the 18th-century political systems that are currently undermining these hard fought for values, once only enjoyed by the men of the bourgeois.",

Serried ranks of party hacks all having one eye on their careers and the other eye on the opposition party’s activities, whilst the rest of us are ignored or “managed” to ensure the various right and left vested interests are protected and promoted. It is easy to see why people can be beguiled by politicians, and their parties, because the only way onto politics is via one. But being part of a party requires a certain amount of abandoning of principles and promoting “groups” who are sympathetic with the party in question.\nStudents are a case in point. Student debt keeps the left wing educational establishment in work whilst transferring wealth from poor families to universities either as government debt (paid for out of taxation) or student loans. Other examples are the future pauperisation of the future young via payments for elderly care out of the elderly’s current wealth. How long before the State decides that in addition to covering elderly care out of inheritable wealth student loans can be paid out of actual inherited wealth. The State and its new industries like elderly care, education, child welfare, domestic abuse and crime all need paying for and tax can and will only go so far.\nYoung people should realise that socialists just want to turn the state into the Nation’s employer of choice for well…. left wing intellectual people who have no connection with the real working class. The bill of course is picked up by the poor old workers. The Conservatives want to do the right thing but in a system that can’t and has rarely ever delivered the “right thing”. They will and currently are doomed to fail. Corbyn is right about that.\nWe offer this warning to the young and old alike; just remember that your interests and the interests of the planet are not aligned with the interests of the State. The State is an 18th century institution designed to prevent civil war and to manage opposition using a crude binary model of government and opposition. In the two or three hundred years it has existed in its modern form it has done well to promote vested interests on left and right. Those interests are no more about ordinary people’s interests now than they have ever have been before.\nSocialism and Corbyn’s “left” are as much part of the State as they are unashamedly about “the Labour Party”and its 1840’s values. They are “socialists”. Socialism is not about liberating the people it is about the party, and delivering the Party’s programme.\nOnly Blue revolution wants to bring together ordinary people in a new politics for the 21st century and re build Britain from the neighbourhood up! Not Parliament down.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_ok-we-try-again-to-explain-the-nature-of-the-conflict-between-islam-and-the-west/content_334.html": "Ok, we try again to explain the nature of the conflict between Islam and the west.\nIt is so hard to explain the real nature of the conflict between Islam and the Western world as the liberal sensibilities of the elite render the issue too fraught with potential allegations of discrimination. Any critical comment about Islam is thus stifled to the point where western values are set aside in a desperate attempt to avoid perceptions of racism. When criminals use Islam to justify their criminality be it terrorism or sexual abuse of children the only acceptable response for the brainwashed western liberal is “it is nothing to do with Islam”. But of course it is and at the same time, it doesn’t have to be. We have seen the effects of the liberal establishment ignoring abuse because of fear of being labelled Islamaphobic and whilst it is pathetic the costs to the vulnerable are real. So we will explain our position again.\nFirstly the Koran is a book that prescribes a lifestyle which is at best hostile to some western behaviours, for example, homosexuality and sexual freedom for women and at worst is brutal in its treatment of transgressors. But the Old Testament and certain parts of the New Testament suggest that the Bible has pretty much the same values. So like a loaded gun, the books themselves are neutral. They both contain authority and prescribe and proscribe behaviours. What makes the books, like the loaded gun, dangerous is the mind of the person who uses the book or wields the gun.\nIn the case of the West, the mindset of the European and those countries that were influenced by the West experienced firstly enlightened thinking in the 16th and 17th century and then capitalism and finally industrialisation. These phenomenal changes took received wisdom and put it into a historical dustbin. The idea began that people had economic rights, the right to contract to choose and consent which eventually took on a social character and arising from this we have liberal and freethinking democratic people who can put the tenets of their faith into a liberal framework. This framework recognises the rights of others. The tension with Islam is that too many observant Muslims can’t do this or won’t do it, believing that people have obligations to behave as willed by God. Thus women, Jewish people and Gay people have rights or perhaps no rights that are prescribed and may be not of their choosing.\nThe issue of terrorism, therefore, is not just about criminal acts of terror, it has to be put into a broader theological context. The question all people of faith should be asked is this, “are you personally able to accept the right of others to have a lifestyle that they want to have, be that a Gay lifestyle or to be sexually liberated as a woman or to believe in a faith other than your faith”. A question like this should be asked of all people who profess faith and hold public office (not just Tim Farron) to confirm that the liberating effects of Western culture has left its imprint on them and they are not colluding with or encouraging discrimination of any kind and perhaps inadvertently fueling crime in the name of religion.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_mark-carney-marx-and-the-decline-of-western-civilisation/content_322.html": "Mark Carney, Marx and the decline of Western civilisation!\nSo now we have the head of the Bank of England Mark Carney pronouncing that Marxism may become relevant because of the technological revolution. He stresses that the Engels Pause which saw low wage growth during the early industrial revolution, explains low wage growth now. Apart from the fact that Marx confined his economic analysis to bushels of corn or yards of linen, how relevant are these observations in a post-capitalist West within an emerging global hegemony?\nFirstly, Marx was writing at a time when the main economic preoccupation was the “surplus value” or profit, created by labour power. Wages ware paid at a level set by the labour market and the downward pressure on wages was caused by the abundant supply of labour rendering wages cheap to the point of survival levels only. Children as young as ten working 12-16 hour shifts in factories.\nThis downward pressure on wages advantaged the capitalists who were able to take greater levels of “surplus value” and in doing so were engaging in a merciless exploitation of their workers.\nAs capitalism settled down, children were removed from the labour market, workers were able to negotiate a better deal for themselves and wage levels rose. The State also intervened to improve the lot of the worker. This is the nub of Marxism, the worker or the State re-appropriated the surplus value previously taken by the capitalist and the capitalist alone. The role of Trades Unions was essentially the same. Take back from the capitalist some of the excessive surplus value generated by the worker in the process of production. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a lot of surplus value and capitalists became very rich and an empire was built on the back of it.\nOf course, increasing output in a capitalist system is important as there would be diminishing profitability without it, but in terms of wage levels, the labour market and government intervention feature more significantly. After any plague, the price of labour power goes up. Machines increase output and of course enhance the wages of those skilled people who remain in work. Labour markets for skilled people are different from the labour market for the unskilled, but they work on the same principles.\nThe issue Carney highlights though is interesting in two further respects. Firstly he fails to address the fact that migration of unskilled labour is a contributory factor in the process of lowering wages, creating downward pressure on wages through oversupply. And he sees the forthcoming crisis of unemployment as likely to re-ignite an interest in Marxist ideas as a solution.\nThe fact economists and politicians seem obsessed with promoting migration suggests that the political system Marx called the bourgeois (capitalist) political system really does have an impulse to lower wages for the worker. And moreover, the left is as guilty as the right in being silent on this issue.\nThe secondly Marxism as a word and an ideology lost all accurate meaning in the 2oth century because of its use to describe fascist, state socialist and feudal dictatorships, all borne of violent revolution and none “Marxian” in any sense Marx would have recognised. However, that doesn’t mean Marxist analysis is completely irrelevant.\nSo how might Marxism become relevant again? This depends on how people use Marxist analysis. Marxism is essentially about two things that spring forth from the capitalist system, one as we have described above is surplus value (profit) and the other is alienation. Alienation is the process by which the worker becomes disassociated from his economic role being a beast of burden to a process or machine.\nToday a capitalist economy Marx would have recognised no longer exists. We are now able or perhaps willing to create national indebtedness to provide a “living wage” to people who have no actual economic function. They create no economic value, and the State isn’t taking surplus value from the bourgeois, it’s taxing and indebting the workers too many of whom are employed by the State itself. We are in some senses living in a post-Marxian age already.\nThe critical relevance about Marx, however, isn’t about wages. Marx was an advocate of material determinism. He basically believed that the economic system creates social values which are necesary to promote the interests of the economic system itself.\nSo, our bourgeois values of contract, choice and consent freedom and democracy which were necessary for the capitalist system to function profitably have taken on a social character and we all expect rights based on these principles today. However, if the nature of the economy becomes as we have suggested debt based with little role for productive Western workers i.e. not creating surplus value or profit, will the values that the economy requires and therefore society requires, alter significantly? The answer is, of course, yes if you apply a Marxian analysis.\nCapitalism in the West is coming to an end and Marx’s economic relevance at a National level has perhaps been eclipsed as the British economy is now global. On that basis, the post-capitalist West probably is sliding back towards a feudal model of power and control and Marx can help explain this. This change is necessary as the economic system operates globally and there is little need for capitalist values of contract, choice and consent at the bottom of this global system i.e. at the bottom of the National level. This is mainly because being dependent on an indebted government for welfare is not a contracted arrangement it is more feudal in character.\nIt’s a wild speculation but the sympathetic approach given to Islamic values which are in total contrast to Contract, Choice and Consent suggest that autocratic and discriminatory principles have some advocates in the world, who are happy to risk pushing aside contract, choice and consent, particularly for women, in the interests of preserving the global economic hegemony.\nWhen capitalism leaves by the front door its values will according to Marx leave by the back. And as we are progressing towards a more and more unfair global economy, by crystallising the worlds current injustices, injustices will be reflected into any society once based on “just” principles of contract, choice and consent, freedom and democracy. Someone out there knows that and doesn’t care. Hence the attack on free speech and the nonsense of hate crime as opposed to “crime” across the western world.\nSo, to answer the question is Carney right to conclude that Marxism will have relevance in the future. The answer is probably yes in the sense of offering an insight into how the values of the global economy create injustice around the world and yes in terms of reframing our understanding of how the global economy maintains power structures and erodes rights in the face of mass Western unemployment. But to offer an insight into wage levels in a post-capitalist West. Marx is probably irrelevant.",

Binary politics has had its day.\nTheresa May seems to have lost her voice, at least the voice that the people used to listen to, whilst at the same time, Jeremy Corbyn seems to have found his, and impressive it has become too. The spectacle of the recent debate was unedifying a slanging match in which the so-called ‘progressives’ ganged up on the hated Tories. It was binary politics at its best. The sad truth is however that the only ‘progressive’ party who will do well on current numbers is Labour and this is because of the electoral system. Once elected though the whole sorry lot will be corralled into the binary politics of the Westminster chamber. This eighteenth-century model forces all shades of opinion into two halves of an argument managed by the party system. The result is that ordinary people feel like observers of an argument the outcome of which will directly affect them but with no ability to contribute to or nuance the outcome.\nPolitical arguments are still being forged by this elderly political system, as they have done since the early 19th century. The difference now is that with diversity increasing, the need for the cooperation of the ordinary person is increasing also. Whilst Labour has made a monumental comeback, the long-term realities are that the binary division in Parliament will continue. Nothing is likely to change the nature of the binary bureaucratic British state and the same old approach will be maintained. With Labour in charge borrowing and spending to ‘invest’ in things for which there will be little obvious return is likely to go up and the challenge will merely be carping from the opposition benches. Corbyn sounds good, he sounds passionate and coherent, the problem is that debt, the weak economic fundamentals, and the cost of the state itself are unlikely to change very much on his watch, but then again he is turning into a man of surprises.",

However the elephant in the room which politicians of all sides are unable to discuss, we are able to reveal as we are not politicians we are ordinary people with an unusual perspective, one that moves away from the normal parameters of debate and hopefully generates purposeful if not challenging discussion.\nThe role of doctors, medics and therapists in any advanced industrial or post-industrial society is the same as the “witch doctor” in any primitive society; to get people back to their full productive capacity. The last thing a society needs are people who unnecessarily burden the economy and society. In less sophisticated societies where, shall we say, life is cheap people die quickly. Illness is a burden, personal and social. When illness requires “care” this “care” is essentially unproductive and so is done by the family, unless the person being cared for has an important role to play in society such as a monarch or overlord or if an ordinary person, they can be brought back to productive health quickly. As recently as the early 20th century the treatment of “Cowards” in the trenches of the first world war illustrates this point nicely. Officers “treated” infantry men executed.\nWe are not anthropologists and don’t know what implications the infirm have had on less advanced societies in the historical past. However old people and the infirm do present a challenge to any society’s productive capacity. We are beginning to experience this here in the west.\nAs we have progressed, society in the western world and elsewhere has been able to set aside some of its social and productive value to enable a humane treatment of some of the elderly and ill to occur. This expenditure requires of course a productive class who created the value so it could either by individual choice or government intervention be distributed to a widening group of unproductive people some of whom are old and some of whom have their productive capacity limited by illness.\nThe medic therefore has a relationship to society which is essentially to get rid of whatever is impeding the individual’s full health and their productive capacity be it within a tribe or an empire. The role of doctors, regardless of their pay, is to get people back to their full productive capacity. As doctors their pay should reflect their success at achieving this universal sociological objective. The elderly should have “banked” social and economic value individually or collectively within families or society and draw on it in their declining years.\nThis brings us back to our opening comments about the Health Service. The problem is that the health service in too many instances is no longer capable of getting people back to full health to fulfil their full productive capacity. It has become, as a result of decades of political weakness and intersecting social policies, a service which undermines individual personal and collective responsibility. It has become a service that keeps individuals alive long enough and unproductively enough to acquire life limiting ailments such as obesity, diabetes and depression to name just three.\nToday we are not prepared to see people suffer or doctors under remunerated, but the reality is that the role of doctors is not to do what they are doing now. The health service was never intended to be brought to its knees or the country that finances it bankrupted by a population of unhealthy people who expect the tax payer, in the form of the government, to sustain them in a wholly unproductive and pointless cycle of illness and medical interventions.\nThe elderly now, who were young adults after the last world war, are probably the last generation of whom one could feel confident they as a generation created social and economic value greater than that which they consumed, and therefore deserve decent treatment in old age. But as for the rest of us, from the ‘Boomers’ onwards what social and economic value will we have to call upon in old age and more importantly where will it come from?\n01.12.15 No to advertising Christianity. Yes, to the promotion of wholly commercial Christmas. Plus, allegations the US is corrupting Iranians with sex and vice. What is going on?\nIs it any wonder that when many cultures in the so called second or third world look at the West, they experience a mixture of confusion and revulsion? Two stories illustrate the incomprehensibility of this secular westernism (1) as we call it.\nFirstly, the Christian Churches, in a nominally Christian country; Britain, are banned from showing in cinemas an advert promoting the Lord’s Prayer. Yet at the same time, the commercial activity of selling Christmas as a period of debt and excessive consumption builds to its predictable crescendo on Christmas day. This must seem perverse even in non-Christian countries. The idea that in Iran it would not be possible to recite the Koran in public places is frankly ridiculous. The difference however would be that be that in the west in general, and in Britain in particular, it should be possible to hear the words of all faiths and none; if of course the “powers that be” were not so weak and unprincipled as to promote other faiths at the expense of our own.\nIt is precisely the secular wests squeamishness about its own religious heritage that has led to a decline in religious pluralism here and more significantly abroad. Let us be honest with ourselves, if the Islamists had not been allowed to think that theirs is the only faith delivering social value, and they were made aware that Christianity was capable of achieving the same, as well being capable of creating increasing amounts of economic value too, it would have challenged the view, held by many of the Muslim faithful in North Africa and the Middle East that Christianity in its secular manifestation is a perverse and perverted faith that sanctions vice and immorality.\nThe reason that this belief holds sway is that real moral , modest, simple Christian voices are silenced in the name of “not causing offence”, whilst to the majority of non- Christians the Christian faith is identified with commercial Xmas and all that is perverse about the west; its delinquency, a pitiful undereducated yet promiscuous welfare dependent class, its planed compromising greed. We can add to that list poor health, and the breakdown of the Christian family into a myriad of “arrangements” that put the needs of infantilised adults before the needs of the real infants and children.\nThe final point we wish to make, and our second story is that if we give up promoting the good that Christianity or Christian heritage can do, and, as claimed by the Iranians we take our perverse secular culture of pornography and vice and use it to try and entrap those of other cultures in an attempt to gain “influence” and game international relations, we are really stooping to a very low and frankly embarrassing level of poor moral behaviour.\nOn the one hand we downplay good Christianity and yet we promote vice abroad which becomes identified as bad Christianity. Christians don’t deserve to be silenced or be misunderstood like this, it encourages intolerance of them and arrogance from other faiths, but moreover Christianity becomes identified with secular westernism and that feeds rage, misunderstanding and even war.\nThe Blue Revolution is not intended to be a mass movement, it is simply a vehicle for encouraging a positive change in behaviour and for stimulating discussion and challenging orthodox “groupthink”. We would argue that if we had had less vice and more faith of all varieties Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu etc over the last sixty years, we may very well be having safe and culturally enriching holidays in North Africa and other troubled locations rather than embarking on yet another bombing campaign. We can start to put things right by allowing the Lord’s Prayer to be heard in British cinemas.\n1 Secular westernism is the practice of free market economics within the context of a secular moral vacuum which gives rise to a type of wealth creation which undermines social value and, whilst creating income for those able to manipulate tastes, desires, and wants, creates little if any genuine economic value.\n04.12.15\nA faith to personalize, collectivize, politicize, radicalize or weaponize; what can we realistically expect from the faithful now?\nThe decision of Britain’s Labour leader to oppose bombing ISIS in Syria shows one extreme of the polarised position on action against ISIS; a sort of “let them get on with shooting us” attitude; naïve but well intentioned as is most left wing thinking on most subjects. On the right we have the bombing which is the “we will do what we can” approach, again well intentioned, and whilst not naïve unlikely to deliver the results envisaged. The argument that the end game is being ignored is valid but it is no basis for not bombing the ISIS criminals. It’s clear that in a place like the middle east end games are the stuff of fools; so much meddling and connivance, oil and power brokering to make any solution hard to both identify and deliver. Just look at the history of the place.\nWe have today a shooting incident in the USA; 14 people killed in what seems to be an ISIS “inspired” act of lone wolf terrorism. Just like the incidents in France and the potential of terror cells in Belgium. Britain will have people like this too, ready to act on impulse either when some random act by the west triggers enough anger to justify detonation and death, or simply because the terrorists feel like “todays the day”.\nThis is the basic problem the west must tackle, lone wolves inspired by, but not necessarily part of, the formal weaponry of radical Islam. We have been keen to talk about ISIS as criminals rather than warriors, but the recent incident in France prompts consideration of the wider Islamic community and from that thoughts about communities of “faith” in general.\nBlue Revolution considers that the difficulty the western powers and therefore western people have, is that western culture is too easily characterised as “immoral” and the Muslim faith unlike Christianity is seen as an antidote to this immorality via its Sharia law. Islam is therefore seen as opposing the “problem” of the west. As people will know, Blue Revolution too views western culture as problematic, and proposes awareness of and therefore avoidance of our “Seven Deadly Sins” because there is still much in the west worthy of preservation and “problematic” doesn’t justify wholesale destruction.\nWhat the west needs is reform, and self-regulation and the corrective of government intervention sanctioned by the people plus widespread moral renewal based on Contract, Choice and Consent between peoples and the people and their government.\nSo what point are we trying to make. Well faith in a modern society needs to be personalised. Those of us at Blue Revolution who have faith do not view our faith or any tenets of it, as something to be imposed on others but we do occasionally collectivise with like-minded believers. We believe that faith should be personalized. This is the reason the Christian Church of England is seen as irrelevant by many as it recognises faith is personal and not political.\nBritish Christianity rightly lacks the power to convert based on grievance or conversion from anger. It is a big step from the personalization of faith to the political or politicization of faith. This involves people grouping together and “sharing” their grievances and their similar views, often attempting to gain converts in the name of grievance. In many ways this is the situation with certain Christians in the US in their opposition to planned parenting or their festering of race hatred. However, it also described a huge proportion of people of the Muslim faith. Adopting the dress and morals of what we have described as “dustbowl” Islam is a political act and it feeds a view of the west that sets people apart who live in the west. Finally, having become politicized it is a small step to being radicalized and fermenting hatred and another large step before one is prepared to kill or blowing oneself up or as we call it weaponse oneself. Weaponisation can occur in other faiths too, the murderers who kill those accessing planned parenting services have weaponised themselves; as of course have suicide bombers and the day tripper Jihadi on the London Underground.\nAll people in the west therefore needs to understand this dynamic, people of all faiths and none. It needs to be understood that if an individual, moves through “personalization” to “Politicization” of their faith it is a process that begins to harden views about others. The views of the Klu Klux Klan illustrate this point. Ordinary Muslims and southern US fundamentalist Christians should be encouraged to see their small acts of politicisation as acts which are not about personal belief but perhaps reinforce difference and implicitly encourage radicalization and for some the act of weaponisation. Jeremy Corbyn’s veto of bombing against ISIS but support for the IRA is another example of the move form personal to political to radical opinion, which for some we are sure inspired weaponisation.\nTo counter this process a simple and universal narrative is required and in addition an abandonment of the current “Political Correctness” agenda in respect of faith. Unless, faith is understood as a personal and possibly collective issue rather than a political movement problem will occur. The mistake of the last twenty years has been to overlook Islam’s political dimensions through the naivety of political correctness.\nIt would today, as a result of PC, be seen as unforgivable to ask of a veiled woman “why do you dress like that”…but it is a reasonable question in these radicalised times, and may indeed give rise to a personalised as opposed to politicised answer such as “it is how I practice modesty, or “my husband, or family tell me to”. Having said that many of the radicalised and Weaponised dress like westerners or in fatigues. So dress is rather complex on its own and gives nothing away.\nThe narrative we need is therefore based on the Blue Revolutionary concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent as the universal conditions of social and moral progress. These are the three key elements of a healthy society that whilst it may not be “free” or “democratic” in a western sense, provides a society that allows the 3C’s stands a good chance of evolving safely and productively in the future and creating a just society. Democracy is expensive so not all societies can afford it. However in the absence of democracy we need the 3C’s to make society just. The only thing such a society would need to avoid are the “Blue revolutionary” Seven Deadly Sins as these corrupt and corrode civility and good manners and inflict inequality and discrimination unjustifiably.\n09.12.15 Donald Trump; a secular westerner sort of gets it….but only sort of!\nA brief post on the back of the recent pronouncement by Donald Trump that some Muslims don’t like Americans. In that bit of his analysis we agree with him and would go further and say that some Muslims don’t like the west not Just the American bit of it.\nThe secular west is not a place where people of faith find comfort; as we at Blue Revolution continually point out. Trumps ludicrous reaction to recent events however just goes to show that the mass appeal he is able like all demagogues to articulate, which is essentially ordinary peoples fear and anxiety. Whilst good at picking up the right vibe his limited skills in analysis and inability to scope realistic solutions render him a buffoon on the world stage.\nWhen there is an expectation that he goes beyond articulating fear he camps it up. For the great man Mr. Trump it would not be sufficient to merely identify a problem; he has to steam in with the Pro American saloon bar solution; thus, we had his ban on Muslims entering the US.\nAs Blue Revolution is a platform to stimulate debate sometime by being provocative, we are pleased that the question was asked “why do some Muslims hate the US”. It was also good to hear that political leaders were the ones tasked to find out why this was the case. Left there, a useful debate could have ensued about the combination of emotions ranging from embarrassment to hatred that is stirred up when people of faith encounter the kind of excessive consumption and trivial social relations that characterises the west and upon which western economies depend.\nWe don’t have to detail the litany of divorce, drink, drugs, sex, pornography and general social chaos, which is “denied” by governments who then plaster over the all too obvious social cracks with government money, in an attempt to obscure just how far from civilised the west has drifted.\nThere is a process of healing the world needs and it could start with a debate about these very complex social and economic issues. However in true buffoon mode Trump closed down the sensible debate and shifted things back to the silent status quo…..the middle ground, the don’t ask don’t tell approach to western problems. By managing to get every other Republican candidate to tell him that his opinions are invalid and ridiculous. ….which of course his conclusions are, the debate was quickly closed down. However, his question is very valid, and it takes people brighter than him to address it.\n14.12.15 Corbyn’s New Socialists don’t know their Marx from their elbow!\nThe bourgeois socialists of Britain’s Corbynista Labour Party and its hangers-on are a group of people who share several left-wing obsessions in common but not necessarily all of them at once, and not necessarily at the same time.\nSome show their credentials by supporting Russia, although Russia is behaving a little like the “spokes-country” for globally derided Christendom. A sort of non- secular westernism in the mould of 19th Century Protestantism. Other “left-wing” groups support 20th century secular Pan Arab causes, others Islamism in its various manifestations covering the whole range of Islamism types from the benign collectivised, to the highly dangerous weaponised Islamism of ISIS and their supporters.\nOne of the latest “Kids on the Block” is a bunch who wish to cleanse the Stalin brand; bringing some benign revisionism to the legacy of Uncle Joe. With the usual collection of Trots and Leninists the marketplace for the “Red Revolutionary” is looking a bit overcrowded. We thought we would offer a “Blue” perspective on our “Red” cousins, whilst also looking at some topical subjects. Regular readers will have noticed that we tend to do this; it helps to pin our brand identity on to an issue and over time to build up a patchwork of small insights that hopefully brings a coherence to the many popular agendas that perplex the world and we are about to allege the “left” lacks.\nThere can be no economic or social algorithm uniting the Left consisting as it does of groups who support an odd range of left-wing policies which often are at odds with both logic and common sense? They come from too many different economic, social and cultural backgrounds for there to be much coherence to their thinking.\nKarl Marx spoke about his theories being scientific in character. Clearly not fully developed as science but totally undermined when his scientific socialism is placed in the hands of those of a so-called left-wing bent. We have endured these people for over a century and a half be they Russian revolutionaries, Chinese revolutionaries, Cambridge Grads circa 1940, supporters of Trotsky’s Left Opposition or anyone of a whole bunch of “revolutionaries” including we suppose good old “Woolfie Smith” of the “Tooting Popular Front”…..oh and Corbyn and crew.\nSo, if what unites the Left isn’t Marxism what unites public sector workers, single mums, students, Trades Unionists, autocrats and people with a dubious grasp of economics and international relations as well as misogynists, feminists, the transgendered and those who desire to change “our way of life” by force of arms.\nWe at A Blue Revolution have been thinking about our Red Revolutionary colleagues trying to distil the unifying theory which must be buried away somewhere in their complex and confusing matrix of political likes and dislikes; what motivates them and what do these disparate groups have in common, and we think we have the answer.\nLet’s start with Capitalism; Marx understood Capitalism in the same way he understood Tribalism or Feudalism. These he saw as simply economic evolving phases that humanity went through, at different times and in different places. This is why we at Blue revolution try and avoid being too censorious about what other cultures get up to…….they may, like Somalia, be locked into a warring tribal culture that it is hard to break away from, or some others may choose to retain practices of the past like our old friend Saudi Arabia, stoning women to death for sorcery.\nFor Marx, all aspects of culture including its faith was a way of ensuring society could provide the value necessary to survive. So, hating Capitalism irrationally and not understanding its contribution to humanities evolution is no more logical than liking and promoting tribalism or dust bowl Islamism in the twenty first century. Culture is either socially and economically coherent with the way economic value is produced or it is not. If it is not, then why not!\nCapitalism whilst promoting inequality, elitism and status was morally “coherent”.\nMarx would have struggled to understand the modern manifestation of capitalism in the form of the consumer “free market” and he would have failed to grasp “Secular Westernism”. Secular Westernism is the consumer free market which is based on contract, choice and consent, but it is now devoid of any social morality. For example, welfare creating a class of adult dependents who like capitalists rely on the value created by others, but who live in idleness, ignorance and squalor. The underclass is far from a reserve army of labour as Marx would have understood them.\nThus, in a secular western world sex becomes commoditised, as do parental relationships, religion, marriage and a whole host of human relationships which should be social and psychological in nature but are in effect “commercial”. This is not “Capitalism” (although there is profit to be had) this is “Secular Westernism” and only the Bods at Blue revolution can see that it is hatred of “secular westernism” which unites the disparate collection of people who fall under the banner “left-wing”.\nThe danger is that by misunderstanding the benefits of the economic principles at the heart of any Marxist period of history, of which capitalism and the free market are but the latest manifestations, it is impossible to understand the confused moral character and motivations of the groups that form the allegiances that the left makes with anti-capitalist groups and how coherent the left is or perhaps is not, at maintaining a moral purpose based on freedom, choice and consent. they don’t know their Marx from their elbow.\n17.12.15 Empire and the EU; “history repeats itself the first as tragedy then as farce”.\nAs everyone from Jeremy Corbyn down will be aware the quote above is from Karl Marx. However, it is often a struggle to identify modern situations where the quote has both relevance and accuracy. Our recent experience of the EU and our experience of empire offer an opportunity to re consider the quote within a context that is clearly Marxian in scale.\nBritain’s imperialism was an attempt, and a relatively successful one, to expand the capacity of British culture to create and amass additional economic value. The process was very simple, the British exported their British Christian social values and economic competence and in doing so, enhanced their ability to amass economic value from the colonies by taking advantage of mass labour and cheap resources. It’s called imperialism.\nTo maximise the chances of achieving this goal the British exported, in addition to their religion and language, their evolving use of capital investment as a way of achieving increasing amounts of economic growth. The project lasted about 300 years. It ended when the elite of the people the British had conquered, grew in skill and confidence and using the “system” they had inherited from their colonial masters, felt able and empowered to grow their capitalism independently from the “parent” culture. From a Marxist perspective this was at least in part a success; in many places sweeping away tribalism and creating a proletariat. This is a point about Marxism that Modern “Socialists” don’t seem to get, as they enthusiastically rub shoulders with tribal type leaders and those who would replace one feudal dynasty with another.\nAnyway back to the main point; the issue holding these newly independent ex colonies back was that whilst the “elite” may have had the skills and ability to operate a social and commercial bureaucracy, at the grass roots the populations were not fit for such purpose and the colonial model run by the British which protected and managed all sections of society, soon became a broken system which failed to deliver a well organised mass labour movement creating economic value via willing ‘exploitation’.\nThe whole thing quickly deteriorated into the tragedy of dictatorship. But at least they got some experience as a society based on the economic freedom of labour and a modicum of gender equality that went with it. Unlike the North Africans and Arabs who were simply manipulated then “pumped” for their oil and as a result retained a culture of tribalism or feudal monarchy with little to mitigate it modern awfulness.\nThe British imperial model’s ability to fully deliver an enduring proletariat failed because it was too easy to abuse rather than economically exploit disorganised labour. The workers levels of social and economic competence meant they were powerless to withstand the abuse visited upon them by the psychotic tribal money grubbers who replaced the colonial rulers, many of the worst offenders being educated in Europe to expect status and power but having no time for capitalisms nuanced legally coherent approach. Brute force and ignorance did just as well.\nEuropean colonial powers; particularly the British, should not be too hard on themselves; they left the seeds of capitalism and from that auspicious start, correctly managed the benefits of any additional economic value created would have led to a socially more egalitarian society such as has happened in Britain since the end of the Second World War; ultimately giving rise to the possibility of a mixed economy or socialism as we call it.\nUnfortunately, the seeds of capitalism were killed by the combination of tribalism and feudalism which was latent in those who took over from the European colonials. The bit the British left behind, the civil service, whilst strangling nascent capitalism by draining the economy of economic value give what value there was to the nation’s leaders in the form of personal wealth, and thus provided the perfect feudal bureaucracy allowing the continuation of autocratic political control.\nSo perversely the bureaucrats who are supposed to be funded by the “real economy”(workers, and wealth creators) became the means by which the economy redistributed whatever economic value there is to the elite and poverty and starvation ensued. Hence the tragedy in the above quote.\nIn Marxian terms the Colonial powers took tribal societies, created nascent capitalist economies which, when they left, slipped into feudalism. However, the countries lucky enough (yes, we did say lucky enough) to have had the British colonial experience had some positive legacy to hold on to, and not just a world language and railways.\nSome European empires were simply rape of a weak country by a stronger one. The British Empire was no like this, it was a commercial empire; trading from within, not perfect by any means but offering freedom from tribalism, and severe gender oppression for those who could become “prolatarianised”. Those who by being forced to sell their labour became acquainted with the concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent, gained the basic building blocks of a modern ‘just’ society that has the possibility to re-establish itself, and start to recognise the rights of workers to have a greater share of the economic value they have created. We at Blue Revolution call Contract, Choice and Consent the trinity of any “just society”; without these no society can progress beyond feudalism.\nNow for the EU……or farce …in the above quote.\nFirstly, we must identify a few obvious differences with the Colonial model. The most obvious one is that in the modern west we create very little that could be called “value”. We create wealth. So, the notion that a redistributive model is needed in the sense that workers are being “exploited” doesn’t really apply. (we won’t go into it here, but value and wealth are not the same thing). The wealth we have, is created by government borrowing and spending, the welfare arrangements propping up consumer spending, as well arbitrary asset inflation such as houses and stock leading to consumer borrowing. We also have at the upper end of the wealth continuum the “fat cats” of the bureaucracy, and those who get rich providing consumer goods and services.\nAnother key element of the Blue Revolution is the need for any western society to understand how little value it creates; both social and economic; and be clear about where that little bit of value ends up. In the modern EU the farce is that just like in post-colonial Africa where the bureaucracy propped up a form of feudalism which impeded social progress, so in the EU, the bureaucracy impedes the progress of society beyond a form of state sanctioned bureaucratic debt redistributive socialism.\nThe problem is that with so little social or economic value being created and a population who neither understands or cares about the need to create value, when the bubble of wealth next bursts, we will have an even more dependent, entitled and under motivated population, not empowered or even willing to evolve socially and economically to start the process of value creation all over again. Like the victims of African colonialism, they will fall prone to being oppressed by whoever is able to gain control of the very limited value still available in the economy. That person or group will have to be ruthless but given the likely chaos at the time, that will be easy; look at how easy ISIS have found it. We should not be complacent about this.\nSo at the risk or repeating ourselves, in chaotic situations like another perhaps terminal economic meltdown when as a culture we have become enfeebled having grown used to spending our wealth but not creating any value upon which it is based, the only coherent reaction is to revert to control via legitimate and fanatical management of the population. A coherent method could be found in fascism, some form of oppressive socialism…Ok fascism, or even Islamofascism. Look what happens when there is a terrorist incident, for example Paris, how quickly free societies revert to social control.\nParadoxically therefore the EU, a value guzzling socialist bureaucracy of the first order, which self-promotes an elite and keeps people placid and pliable by manufacturing consumer wealth, as it simultaneously destroys social value through welfare dependence, immigration etc is a risk to us all.\nThe whole EU process is undermining the likelihood of the core western values of contract, choice and consent surviving the next great economic catastrophe. As with Colonial Africa it won’t be the bureaucrats and technocrats that suffer…..it will be the rest of us. Don’t let the current farce turn into another tragedy. You have been warned!\n19.12.15\nIf you don’t know what you really want in life, think about what you might end up with in death; if society can provide it by then of course!\nJust think about it.\n22.12.15 Ntokozo Qwabe and Cecil Rhodes; a partnership forged by Capitalism-regrettably for him!\nNtokozo Qwabe has expressed the view that the statue of the long dead patron of his Oxford scholarship should be removed as Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist and “looted Africa”. At A Blue Revolution we feel this is a topical story having appeared a day or two after our post on Tragedy and Farce. Ntokozo Qwabe’s view exemplifies the well-intentioned but misplaced conflation of political correctness, moral relativism and anti-imperialism which has dominated the debate about Empire for far too long.\nOf course, Empire was “problematic” but not in the way imagined. When the likes of Rhodes and others took charge of parts of Africa, they saw the potential to spread Christianity and without being aware of it to proletarianize those who could be taken out of the tribe and put in workplace. With slavery abolished and tribalism in decline these proletarianized workers contracted as “free” labour, had choice about who they worked for and consented to remain with their employer having in theory at least the chance to leave if they wished to. Now cries will go up that this was exploitation on a grand scale. We agree it is exploitation but disagree it was wrong if the result is greater freedom for all eventually.\nWhat Rhodes and others did was replace the poverty brutality and overt sexual discrimination of tribal life, it’s uncertainty and ritualistic practices and allowed modern values and agricultural techniques to generate greater economic value in Africa than the indigenous population could hope to have created by repeating ancient rituals and tribal superstitions. Like we always say, life is about value; how you create it, how much of it you have, who controls it, and what you do with it. Admittedly the tribal social values were pushed aside, the certainty of gender based social roles dispensed with as women were offered a degree of liberation. So, with more flexibility of labour, Empire was able to generate much greater value upon which there was greater wealth to distribute. There was more certainty, as science replaced superstition. The world of western science had started to replace world of tribal ritualism.\nNow Ntokozo Qwabe makes a couple of points which whilst perhaps true, typify the limited and constrained nature of the debate. Firstly, the value taken, as he says the “resources and labour of my people” were acquired by the Empire builders but they, in exchange, liberated people from what by modern standards would be the horror of tribalism. Where this happened, it took women away from the savagery of FGM and assisted people in general to create better lives for themselves. Tribalism whether in Afghanistan or Africa is a way of life that no longer needs to exist; but where it does, lives are impoverished superstitious, obsessive and short and women’s lives often marred by institutional violence and discrimination.\nThe other point Ntokozo Qwabe makes is to claim that Rhodes saw Anglo Saxon culture as superior to African culture. Well if life is about creating value the Anglo- Saxon model was greatly superior to that practiced within tribal societies. The amount of value created by Capitalism allowed wealth for the empire builders (right or wrong) but also allowed some of it to better the lives of the indigenous Africans. To Claim this is racist is to miss the point. Rhodes and others were almost forced to conflate culture and race. It’s how it was for them; black people lived in ineffective tribal groups; westerners had the advantage of scientific methods to drive up value and create a way of life that reduced fear and uncertainty for all. And moreover, Marx would have agreed with Rhodes rather than Ntokozo Qwabe.\nIf we imagine that the ancient Egyptians had arrived in east Anglia in the UK in say 3000 BC, they would have taken the view that the tribal groups there were ineffective at providing high levels of value allowing a structured and secure way of life for all.\nThe Egyptians too may have made an association between skin colour and the British tribes shortcomings compared to themselves, as without doubt the Egyptians along with the Samarians were able to establish a form of feudalism whilst many cultures were still tribal. They may like the Romans much later have seen Britain as a country of savages.\nNtokozo Qwabe is benefitting from the economic system that has liberated him and could go further and liberate his continent from separatism, tribalism fear and war. It does not help the process of positive change when people criticize and attempt to destroy capitalism in Africa (and other places) and expect the result to be “socialism”. Socialism only comes through the birth canal of capitalism and through no other birth canal.\nThis move to socialism without passing through a capitalist phase never happens…. it can’t until people understand the concepts of contract, choice and consent (usually by being part of a capitalist economy at some point). In the absence of this understanding and full acceptance of Contract Choice and Consent plus a value generating economy society will only ever slide back to either tribalism or as we said earlier this week, with the help of an imperial civil service, feudalism can replace a failed or not yet fully established capitalism. The failure of ‘over ripe’ Capitalism in Europe in the 1920’s gave rise to a form of “technological feudalism” called fascism. Immature capitalism in Russia gave us Leninist-Stalinism.\nIn Africa and the Middle East today we have in too many places collapsing feudal societies and their relentless slide into tribalism. In Syria feudalism is sliding into tribalism and in Western inner cities, crime empires are, and always have mirrored feudalism but with turf wars over drugs and prostitution even inner-city gangs are adopting tribal values. The western elite don’t get this and the so-called revolutionaries like Russel Brand don’t seem to grasp it either. The moral practices of these nations or inner-city groups reflect the economic reality that they operate within be that tribal, feudal or free market.\nCapitalism has failed its global mission but has left a slightly more permanent imprint in the west with its ‘market-based economy’ founded on contract choice and consent. Unfortunately, the failing market-based society (as opposed to market-based economy) undermines it and leads to corrosive “secular westernism”. The danger is that by criticising the bourgeois wealth and liberty creators of the nineteenth century Ntokozo Qwabe simply undermines the system that may still liberate the non-westernised world but with people like him the west is not out of the danger zone yet.\n29.12.15 Acceptance of all faiths and none: How far is this determined by economics?\nReference has been made to the British being accepting of all faiths and none; a fact which we at Blue Revolution whole heartedly endorse. No country apart perhaps for the United States has done more to welcome and integrate those of other faiths than the British but there is another side to this good news story. This accommodation has more recently been made at the expense of our Christian heritage as much as because of it.\nin the past British willingness to accommodate all faiths was largely due to Britain’s capacity to absorb labour due in large measure to its thriving capitalist economy; the ethic of which was to take people who had productive capacity and turn them into workers or as Marx would describe them the proletariat. The most ambitious of these used the opportunity of freedom underpinned by contract, choice and consent to carve themselves a niche within the system that began by employing them.\nSo far so good; Christianity in the form of Britain’s Protestantism driving a well-tuned economic machine which grew with enough vigour to allow immigrants to be absorbed painlessly into the economy and thence into society. The “morality” of the system was driven by the needs of the economy, so all had to yield something of their culture to the demands of the economy but as within the United States there was scope to practice the old cultures too in what was described as a social ‘melting pot’.\nThe UK’s post war settlement created a new “socialist” environment which saw the state owning and running industries and the empowerment of the working classes which resulted in a model for wealth redistribution with the “state” acting as the conduit for re allocation of wealth from business to the workers. The idea that we have rowed back from “socialism” is true only in the sense that today Britain has had to abandon re allocating capitalist wealth which was created by capitalism’s workers and now re distribute government debt to the taxpayers having created an army of state employees and a growing army of the welfare and health care dependent.\nThe upshot of this “progress” is that Christianity has been undermined by the state and this has fed what we call “secular westernism”; the pursuit of personal stimulation and self-advancement and the abandonment of personal and collective responsibility to the state. The Post war settlement only worked when the value upon which the wealth was created and distributed was created by an army of workers rather than by a handful of financial institutions.\nWelfare once shorn of its legitimising Christian influence (to get individuals back to productive independence) became the progenitor of a new class of non-worker who simply settled down to collect benefits and live an aimless life of unemployment and poor health. This is where the relevance of our title comes in as into the ranks of what is colloquially known as the ‘underclass’, comes a whole class of immigrants who are also able to avoid the demands of contracted employment and the personal growth that goes with it. Contracted employment is an activity that forges a deep commitment to “freedom” based on Contract, Choice and Consent. Some settle into an angry aimlessness and a state subsidised obsession with faith as the end goal of life as is clearly spelt out in various Hadiths of the Muslim faith.\nAs we settle into secular western ambivalence Christianity has given up being little more than a cheerleader for the post war settlement in the UK. This coupled to the economic change that economic value produced by workers is now eclipsed by dependence on debt and welfare based consumption offers the newly arrived and more traditional faiths the opportunity to try and stop our apparently relentless decline into ‘ignorance of faith and moral depravity. In Belgium and France, we see much more worrying evidence of this process than we see in the UK. There is no point in welcoming people and then allowing them to settle down to generous welfare, subsidized to stay out of step with what freedom means to people of the west.\nSo, Britain has been a tolerant country and has a proud tradition of integrating migrants. The last thirty years may through welfare, the decline in the role of Christianity and the sheer number of migrants who have no heritage of freedom based on contract, choice and consent, undermine what can still, just about, be classed as Britain’s proud claim.\n01.01.16 Reflections on 2015 from Blue Revolution.\nIt has been in too many ways a worrying year for tolerance and acceptance of all faiths and none. At the beginning of 2015 we were shocked by the murder of staff at Charlie Hebdo with too many random acts of terror littered in between, culminating in the Paris shootings. Western countries and we include the Russians in this, are now exposed to terror for trying to tackle the horror of ISIS. Yet whilst the west tries to tackle ISIS it continues to turn a blind eye to similar regimes that, whilst seemingly “civilised” by virtue to being trading nations are really autocratic bureaucracies and are as intolerant and brutal as the criminals of ISIS. By this we mean Saudi Arabia and Gulf States\nTo bring some coherence to this conflicted situation , the west needs to identify a coherent narrative which leads and inspires the world and makes a clear demarcation between the “values” of the west up to and including freedom and those of other cultures which whilst promoted by legitimate governments, operate to separate and discriminate on the basis of faith, sex, gender and sexuality.\nThe problem with creating a coherent western narrative is that the west has a whole load of problems which undermine any attempt to credibly achieve moral equivalence with more rule bound and brutal cultures.\nThe Sultan of Brunei’s restrictions on Muslims celebrating Christmas is probably as much about what Christmas has come to represent in the west as it is to simple religious chauvinism. The challenge for the west is to try and achieve a culture which promotes “freedom” based on the capitalist/Christian concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent, whilst reigning in the unintended consequences of lifestyles characterised by industrial scale illegitimate birth, divorce, adultery, pornography etc. We at Blue Revolution are not concerned with a person’s sexuality any more than we are with gender or sex (other than to promote equality and fair treatment for females) but we are concerned by social decay and the proliferation of unsustainable lifestyles of all types. We would argue that Darwinian theory rejects any social system that promotes self-interest at the expense of the family, the community and wider society.\nThe situation the west has to tackle we call “secular westernism”. It is the modern culture of pursuing self-interest based not on wealth from productive activity (creating social and economic value) but on “wealth” created through consumerism, government spending and welfare.\nThe free market is amoral and has been used by many who are immoral to create wealth for themselves at the expense of the rest of us our children and the planet. These immoral wealth creators undermine social values and bring about a slow social deterioration which requires government intervention to mitigate its effects; more welfare and healthcare! This process also undermines any attempt to be ecological as more housing and consumption is the outcome. In fact, as in the UK today economic “growth” is in too many ways a vicious cycle; welfare funded social decay masquerading as sound economic stewardship. It’s complex but think about it.\nAs far as we at Blue Revolution are concerned therefore the arguments of the so- called ‘left elite’ are incoherent because the adherents of “welfarism” fail to recognise the full corrosive nature of the social decay created in their name. They also fail to understand the life limiting effects of welfare on the individuals trapped on welfare. Additionally, the left also fetishizes the need for more state intervention to correct the declining social reality welfare creates. Hence the growing epidemic in mental health problems. We believe in welfare but not if it dulls resilience and self-reliance and promotes the social annihilation of the family.\nSo just as in a Dyson vacuum cleaner there is more than one vortex’s operating simultaneously; the “growth through social decay” vortex and the necessary “growth of “good” government” to sort out the mess. Neither is sustainable and neither are the solution to the west’s problems. Accepting this is the challenge for the west in 2016 and beyond. The people, not the government need to act and to understand the nature of the wests problems and then by becoming “Blue Revolutionaries” do something on a personal level to contribute to the wests economic and social recovery.\nPeople should use their vote to support governments who want to row back a little from the march towards the kind of elite big state socialism of the last seventy years. Big state socialism is elitist and unfair the EU arguably being by far the greatest exemplar. Another example this time of big state elitism is the farce of the Paris agreement where the “public” wanted to make no changes to their lifestyle so left it to governments to negotiate what these would be but governments have no public legitimacy to do this so all agreed to collectively hand wring on behalf of their populations.\nIn respect of other cultures with perhaps extreme Islam (be it in Saudi Arabia, or Iran) at the most intractable end, they need to accept that the west struggles to understand the causes of its problems and does not deliberately try to promote unsustainable lifestyles that intelligent people of all faiths and none would find it difficult to encourage such as casual sex, and intergenerational welfare dependence.\nThe west just lacks understanding and a coherent response to the problems its “market-based economy” has created. The non-western countries need to work with the west to stop the terrorism that is intended to destroy the west and perhaps show some understanding that with the wests freedom comes the contract, choice and consent and thus allows individuals to fail and slide into immorality.\nFinally, the review of 2015 suggests to us that if we could promote, as the basis of our narrative to the world, Contract, Choice and Consent then the west may be able to come to peaceful and constructive accommodation with non-western regimes. These regimes may wish to recognise that with our cultural components in place the future for their citizens are less likely to be compromised by the growing demand for freedom leading to repression and civil war.\nHopefully this may happen without the decline into social problems which has characterised the wests early adoption of freedom as a way of managing society.\nHappy new year.\n04.01.16 Compare Saudi Arabia and Iran to observe the different economic factors which should be used to understand ISIS\nClaims that ISIS are beaten or are on the back foot and are, losing territory are largely irrelevant to the overall life span of this disagreeable group of thugs.\nIt is unclear how ISIS are funded or indeed how they are trying to manage the complex business of winning hearts and minds, so they achieve a level of legitimacy required of any state. In the absence of wide scale legitimacy ISIS are not a state they are a group of people who have taken over parts of a state and are now systematically destroying it by pursuing their seventh century dust bowl interpretation of Islam through terror and their brand of religiously sanctioned brutality. They will, as a result of their economic illiteracy, fail hence the reason they threaten to take their terror abroad. We at Blue Revolution are economic determinists; If there is no coherent economy for ISIS there is no state and no coherent society.\nSaudi Arabia is an interesting country to compare with ISIS; Saudi Arabia is a wholly functioning state with a standard array of State attributes for example Defence, Education, Health and Justice Systems. However Saudi Arabia is a country that holds that harsh punishments including death by public beheading are a legitimate way of dealing with the consequences of an individual’s personal weakness, as well as for real crime such as murder.\nThe whole structure of government and the Saudi nation is paid for by oil that is simply pumped out of the ground and sold to an oil guzzling west. This is an under considered fact about Saudi Arabia; it is nothing without oil. ISIS are nothing full stop. For too many other North African nations “Tourism” is almost a proxy for oil and just as precarious in the long term too. The whole region is therefore at risk of long term economic and societal failure. Particularly if Islam returns to more puritanical regimes elsewhere in the Muslim world.\nThe message therefore is that unless one has an economic vision and one which is coherent with the needs of the global labour and technology markets (competing with nations like China and India Europe and the US) one cannot optimistically call ones state a “State” with a long term future. If one relies on just one natural commodity one is in a precarious state. The vulnerability of Saudi Arabia once the oil runs out, can’t be lost on the Saudi princes and may explain the regional hostility to Saudi Arabian monarchy and some recent executions.\nIran is in many ways no less intractable on punishment under Sharia law than is Saudi Arabia. The execution of gay men is commonplace. However, they are a country more embedded within the global family of nations from the perspective of aspiration, technology, and a view that their economy needs talent and education to achieve its economic objectives. With this foundation, the way Iran does business makes it more compatible with the west. This may seem odd as the west’s relationship with Saudi is recognised as that of an ally, whereas until recently Iran was classed as an enemy. Taken over a span of many decades however the consequences of picking attractive but incompatible allies (particularly if they have oil) resembles that of choosing attractive incompatible partners; the relationship will be profitable for as long as you can pretend you have something in common.\n07.01.16 The Labour Party: A party for women. Oh yeah!\nWe at Blue Revolution are going to get unusually controversial because we going to explore the claim made by two Labour party activists, one an MP that the Labour Party is the party for women. No party in our opinion can really claim to be the party for women or indeed a party for ordinary men. The country is too diverse to enable this claim to make any sense. Women like men have a variety of aspirations and expectations that may be positively influenced by the tax and benefits system or they may not. Similarly, the nature of the economy dictates terms too, as does the culture based upon it. All this is positively received or frustratingly runs counter to the expectations of individuals or indeed their best interests\nWhat these Labour party spokes women said was “promoting the interests of women” was little more than the self-defeating consequences of social engineering, that started out in earnest under Blair’s “New Labour”.\nThe modern, state regulated mixed economic system, present in most advanced western economies seems to us to financially advantage a certain type of middle class individual who benefits from either a well remunerated government job, or a well paid jobs in industries that rely on that Wizard of Oz commodity “consumer confidence”; banking for example. So, if we park these people to one side, we can look at the rest of society and look at how our “social Engineered” society has evolved since let’s say the 1990’s and how it has affected people, but in particular, women.\nFor far too many house price inflation and debt is a substitute for real value-based earnings. House price inflation coupled to a weakening of the Christian marital contract of “for richer or poorer” has resulted in many couples breaking up. Just when the “richer or poorer” clause should have come into its own too many couples discover they have a nice little nest egg within which they sit uncomfortably together, stressed out with children and no longer fired up with our modern interpretation of love; namely lust, so they leverage and part.\nMarriages break down, children are separated from parents usually men, and women (and men) go off in search of “love”. The escalating rate of sexual abuse and domestic violence reflects this “sociological” change. As does the unrelenting increase in the number of “single mums”; too many of whom are on benefits and have “boyfriends” and can’t help bringing up children with an array of emotional problems or exposure to sexual abuse but may also be committing various types of benefit fraud.\nWe must not forget though that this “sociological phenomenon” has been socially engineered, because it drives consumerism, and drives the housing market and makes people feel “good about themselves”; or it is assumed it does it.\nWe don’t have numbers but in the UK the volume of “reconstituted families” and single parent families is something the “system” does not record. It would be too morally embarrassing to admit the numbers and that outside of the “state employment sector” the next biggest driver of economic consumer confidence is probably welfare, with its blend of “in” and “out” of work benefits delivered to a hotchpotch of fluid family units.\nNow the balance sheet! By treating women as though they as a vulnerable sex as much prone to ‘unwanted’ pregnancy as their Victorian forbears we undermine their moral capacity and we do it with welfare. Unlike the Victorian who had to show moral restraint to avoid unwanted pregnancy, the modern female (and male) must show little if any restraint. This diminishes for the women the vast array of non- biological sex-based opportunities that may be available for her. For the modern woman sex is casual and sadly a social expectation. For those of faith or of a Darwinian persuasion, this leads to casual procreation; not the pursuit of social improvement but a race into the evolutionary grave yard.\nInto this environment (and I’m not talking about the state employed or well remunerated private school educated middle classes) children are exposed to uncertainty and loss of dads, grandparents, homes, friends etc. It creates a range of personality problems for young people that lead to promiscuity or violence and require more of the soothing balm of state intervention, health services and welfare to mitigate its harsher side effects. The demand for better mental health provision is all the evidence we need that we are getting something wrong.\nIt is the girls who lose out the most in the “socially engineered” but inhumane system. Boys expecting, nay demanding sex and not just pleasurable sex love as Karl Marx called it. Boys who are insecure, unreliable and porn exposed are by and large an unappealing catch, so relationships last just long enough to pop out the next clutch of welfare babies.\nThis is a society without its Christian anchor points, a society that promotes the very characteristics that Faith and civilisation have been trying to overcome since the beginning of time; namely fear, insecurity and uncertainty. Incidentally Sharia law is seen by a growing number of men and women as the antidote to what we have described above. Sharia law would solve the problem and its advocates know this, but at what cost freedom and what cost to women?\nFinally, with the breakdown of the family and the decline of choice for too many women to achieve more than their “traditional” role as mothers, but without the traditional security of a loving family to help them, the final humiliation for women comes in old age. With no independent wealth derived from a life-time of work and saving, and with a malfunctioning or estranged family, they slide into old age, too often alone, but “managed” by the state, the State acting, as in their early life, as a proxy the family.\nThis is an unintended nightmare and parody of the post war settlement, and its then proud boast; the state offering support “from cradle to grave”.\nSo, when the Labour Party wants to claim to be the party of women we ask; how so?\n09.01.16 The EU reaping the whirlwind of naive policy on immigration.\nThe immigration situation in Europe is unavoidable. The Arab States and North Africa have been kept in a state of perpetual adolescence by the British, United States and European elite as to their advanced economies took advantage of these politically under-developed Nations and could make a living simply providing oil or cheap holidays in the sun. Now due to economic under development and Western foreign and economic policy wars people are forced to migrate from nations on the slide back to tribalism.\nThe complex nature of Capitalism with its free but unequal relationships and core of Protestant Christian theology (Which we at Blue Revolution maintain gave rise to the economic trinity of Contract, Choice and Consent) drove a period of productive growth and economic expansion that continues to provide enormous wealth for those fortunate enough to be on the right side of the debt based twenty first century economic equation. Unfortunately, as peddlers of essentially one product Arab and North Africans are on the wrong side of this equation.\nWhat European as opposed to British “Capitalism” has failed to do is leave a capitalist legacy south of the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike the European Empires the British left proto “Capitalism” a legacy which whilst not perfect and exposed too often to the corruption of dictators has seen many African nations withstand the inevitable slide back into tribalism. Tribalism as we have said before is a form of social order that is rule based and discriminates against others and women.\nHowever we see tribalism returning all over the world in the same way we observe authoritarianism consolidating or even re-emerging or in the case of Iraq being destroyed by a naïve US/UK Foreign policy that believed it could impose “democracy” on a country that had a heritage of submission both to God and to the secular state.\nWhen you destroy authoritarianism as in Iraq you get tribalism and the desire to fight until a city resembles one of those pop-up car parks you see in modern city centres before the developers move in do the final pulverising. To think the UK and US considered going after Assad and even flirted with the idea of bombing Iran is absolutely frightening. These policies would have ushered in Armageddon, not with nuclear weapons but with a slow relentless guerrilla war, destruction of the west from within.\nSo, what do we at Blue Revolution consider to be the answer to what is clearly the worrying corrosion of advanced western values by gangs of uninvited guests fleeing countries destroyed by a combination of tribalism and western hubris?\nFirstly we need to understand that western culture is not about “democracy” per se. “Democracy” and “Freedom” are by products of Contract, Choice and Consent and the only way you get these dispensed on a mass scale is through the development of a capitalist economy…Sorry all you lefties but go and read your Marx again…….. and properly this time! So, we need to get our “guests” into the habit of working for their wages and to stop the subsidisation of idleness through welfare. Welfare for westerners is bad enough (see previous posts) but for people whose politics is theological and who’s theology goes little further than worshipping God, welfare turns them quickly towards thoughts of the creation of a European Caliphate.\nWe misunderstand this essential point at our peril, just look at Copenhagen and other European cities and tell us that we are really looking after the interests of western women by allowing men to systematically abuse them driving them through fear back into the home and off the streets or only to venture out accompanied or with a male relative; sound familiar?\nSecondly, we need to get the technocrats who run Europe to understand that money invested in jobs for migrants now they are here, is money well spent. The devil makes work for idle hands. We also need to recognise that the likelihood of any Arab or North African nation accepting “Freedom” based on Contract, Choice and Consent is unlikely within at least three lifetimes and containing the tribal impulse may need some form of slowly evolving feudal structure until “enlightenment” descends.\nThe EU could do this in North Africa and leave EU countries alone to get on with running themselves. We don’t need the EU, but North Africa does. Spending the EU levy to keep people in their own country and working to build their own “free” society would be money well spent.\nThe EU should be working with Assad and others and developing the Capitalist economy in the North African region as well as helping Africa to become the world’s breadbasket by removing barriers to trade. Not doing these things undermines Europe morally as well as economically and socially. The left will object but again go back to Marx and read him properly this time.\nFinally, we must accept we have been wrong over the last 80 years in respect of our policy towards the countries now devolving into chaos. And yet we don’t change tack. We have the Saudi’s, another “infantilised” nation with their oil wealth. Let us not remain silent about them, they may be our neighbour now, but they are not our neighbour out of choice more necessity. Who else can buy their oil and sell them state of the art weaponry?\nLet us also look at ourselves. “Secular Westernism” is a grotesque development of free market capitalism that has evolved because the west has lost its appetite for Christian moral behaviour. If we want to have morality springing from within each of us, rather that imposed from outside, we need to get a grip on the tendency of the market to commodify everything including sex and human relationships. Perhaps this is the biggest challenge for the west and will determine whether we succeed, or we fail to move the world towards a culture recognised globally as “good” as opposed to various types of bad.\n16.01.16 David Cameron suggests lessons in family life and the EU lessons in how to treat women AIMED AT MIGRANT MEN. Both are missing the point.\nDavid Cameron believes that the lamentable state of family life for many children in the UK can be addressed by “lessons” in how to be a family.\nThe EU equally baffled by what to do about the situation they now find themselves in with migrants roaming the street in search of single women who according their simple Islamic culture are immodest and are therefore offering themselves for sex by their “immodesty”, offer a similar solution.\nNeither really hit the point; both are a bureaucratic response that skims the psychological surface of the problem. Here at a Blue Revolution with our collection of divorces, failed relationships and reconstituted families have an alternative analysis but as with all revolutions the solution is neither easy or without pain.\nThe issue of attitudes towards family life and the way migrants treat women is fundamental to the values of the individual. It is a bit like the attitude towards debt. You know how much forbearance you have towards acquiring debt; some totally opposed to it, others rack it up and then some more. Having ‘lessons in debt’ would achieve little unless there was some “pain” that resulted from the levels of debt acquired; mere lessons would quickly be forgotten when outside of the classroom and the gains and losses could be rationalised and the conclusion reached that justified ones attitude.\nShifting social attitudes is always problematic and over thousands of years attitudes are shaped by the interplay of economic, religious and social factors. In simple societies attitude shifts are often met with a violent response until over time the economic logic of the change is apparent. And so, it is with “family life” and “attitudes towards women”. We have two different problems here, but we have one single solution. The solution is “exposure to moral hazard”.\nThis is how we at abluerelovution.com we believe it should work. Firstly, the financing of family life is returned to the employment market as opposed to being state subsidized irrespective of the “competence” of the parents. An economically “competent” couple who manage their finances competently (whatever that looks like as long as it is legal) can offer competent parenting. The current arrangement where “welfare” babies are born to the unemployable and often criminal are a social aberration that will undermine the strength and vitality of our economy and therefore our future.\nWe bang on about CONTRACT, CHOCE and CONSENT as the building blocks of a free democratic society and for this to be preserved, democracy needs to have new generations of those who have an embedded sense of Contract, Choice and Consent. This is where bureaucratic Socialism goes blindingly wrong, by compromising the three “C’s” the state ultimately undermines democracy.\nSo if your “welfare” baby is born the parents should be given activity to do; environmental work for example, that enables them to pay for the baby, a single parent will need to find a job to support themselves and in the absence of this the baby will be put up for “economic” adoption. Economic adopters are People who adopt but don’t cut the “birth parent” out the equation and get some subsidy from the “birth parent” and state. Keeping these “birth” people on board is important as they are the sad counterpart to the concept of full moral responsibility. Over time the attitude towards parenting will shift. Parenting will be it should be (and is by some) a very responsible socially and economically important job rather than is increasingly the case the product of a morally ambiguous “money shot” from two people who have entitlement and adolescence as their defining characteristic.\nSome will argue that this approach undermines women’s rights, but we say undermining a woman’s economic role by subsidising her biological role is just as undermining and skews the concept of choice.\nFinally, our migrants. Work, Work and more Work. No one should simply arrive uninvited and sit around watching TV and working themselves into an adolescent froth about the absence of tribal or authoritarian “morality”. Give them all jobs, even made up jobs doing environmental work. Also give them a warm safe place in a hostel and tell them to work (i.e. paid private sector employment) their way out of it or go home, when home is safe enough for them to go. To Mr Cameron and colleagues in the EU economics we say this the answer to your issues, economics on a very personal level.\n19.01.16 The Lefts hatred of capitalism is as irrational as the fetishizing of socialism. Both are unsafe in this slippery world.\nRussell Brand once spoke on the subject of capitalism and identified some issues….. let us try and capture his drift:\n” People are becoming hostile towards a western socio political and economic hegemony wot systematically undermines freedom and alienates the masses, creatin anger and alienation wot reflects the malfunctioning of the bankrupt prevailing military industrial system through the disillusioned antipathy of the massed ranks of workers who’s consciences must be raised by a vanguard of revolutionary leaders who highlight the exploitation of the masses and expose the criminal activities of the prevailing elite. Wot needs to change is that the mass energy of the exploited should be turned to thoughts of overthrowing this criminally obtuse system of elite self preservation……..\nWell Ok he might not have said this exactly but it is the sort of pretentious half- baked Marxian waffle he would have said….or, so we at A Blue Revolution think anyway. But whilst Brand had a point, his analysis was woefully short of the mark and his solutions non-existent. But as we say….he had a point, many people have a sense that Capitalism or rather its modern manifestation “the free market” is going a little haywire and with that other things suffer too like democracy, but what exactly is the problem and is the solution more socialism?\nHistorically the role of Capitalism has been to free people from the bondage of servitude within feudal structures in the same way that the servitude within feudalism freed people from the horror and starvation and uncertainty of tribalism. Capitalism without doubt has its problems but the biggest one is that its early manifestations were essentially elitist in character but not in the most obvious way.\nThe elite feudal overlord exploited his tied workers who were bonded and essentially the property of the overlord and his land. In exchange for this arrangement the tied worker delivered his labour unwaged to those who were above him in rank and title.\nCapitalism achieved the task of freeing the tied worker; creating the waged “employee” who whilst free to sell his labour was also “free” to starve. The illusion created was that at this level capitalism was no different from “feudalism”. But of course, in the case of the worker it was. The worker might have been horrified by things like industrialising agriculture and the mind-numbing monotony of the factory system but unlike the feudal worker he could travel freely, move up the social rankings and achieve wealth by dint of his own brain power and effort. Feudalism had few opportunities like this. There were some notable exceptions to this general rule; Henry VIII’s treasurer Cromwell was low born…but Capitalism opened the flood gates to this process of personal improvement. It took centuries though.\nWhere capitalism left a mark, usually where the British empire left its imprint outside Europe, people became workers, not slaves or feudal subjects. Capitalism is what Capitalism does. So, in terms of this process alone people became “free”. Capitalism liberated people and has liberated women, admittedly too slowly but it is the capitalist system driving social change that has brought about liberation, it is sadly not the other way around. The proto fascism of female cultural subjugation was in large measure brought under control by capitalism according “worker” status to women, slowly making the woman a “factor of production” as opposed to subordinated wife or home bound mother. This process of liberating women from biologically determined roles has now been stalled by post war “socialism” and the welfare trap within the western free market system. More of this later.\nCapitalism can only be capitalism when certain pre cursors are present and these emerged about three hundred years ago. These are what we at a Blue Revolution call the three C’s, the essential precursors to Capitalism; Contract, Choice and Consent. It was with these three factors in place that Capitalism began to shift ordinary people away from servitude towards, we admit, a rather miserable freedom. But freedom it was and freedom it remains.\nHowever, the main obstacle to workers liberation and one of the two the main and significant “feudal” throw backs within the capitalist system was that the boss simply replaced the feudal overlord. Workers might be free, but they were still exploited. They got some of what they produced back in the form of wages but the largest chunk of value they created went to the capitalist who acquired and accumulated this value giving rise to the nineteenth century socialists claim that “all property is theft”. The other throwback to feudalism is that the whole system was hierarchical in character. Ranks of managers below the boss, reflected the rank structures of feudalism and allotting a place for all within a class system.\nBut Capitalism had to happen, without it, people would not have been liberated. without it, Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn would not be able to try to arouse the ire of the free “workers”. He would have been slain for treason. Had it not been for Capitalism, large parts of the world would be excluded from an economic family that can trade on equal terms with trust borne of the freedom allowed by Contract, Choice and Consent. So, when we hear the left criticizing capitalism and demanding its overthrow, we ask “what bits of it do you want to overthrow?” because some of it should be kept in the interests of freedom and progress. Chucking out contract, choice and consent to deal with ‘unfairness’ using an elite bourgeois parliament won’t do it at all. It will make matters worse.\nTherefore, for the traditional left-wing we believe this question is a little problematic as the “quote” from comrade Brand we hope illustrates. You simply can’t overthrow an old system without dragging bits of it into your new system. The existence of hierarchy being the bit of the old system dragged into Capitalism with the ever- present threat of its rebirth at any given moment of crisis.\nThe return to authoritarianism in Europe in the 1930’s arose from the collapse of capitalism in countries which were still feudal in character. The slide back into tribalism in the modern middle east due to the collapse of their authoritarian systems; no culture of Contract, Choice and Consent to spur an emerging capitalism so as to create the liberation and freedom the west enjoys (and as our 7 deadly sins suggest we abuse).\nSo, there is a defence of capitalism! A system that gave freedom but with a financial cost to the worker. What of the lefts fetishizing of Socialism and how dangerous is this?\nSocialism would not and could not have happened without the Capitalist system; a point all too often lost by the traditional left wing. The economic model that evolves into socialism has to be based on two of that capitalist systems key features; one is the creation of value on the kind of industrial scale that can only be delivered by capitalism, and secondly to avoid the slide into fascism there must be a genuine observance of Contract, Choice and Consent.\nAll too often we hear the left-wing criticising capitalism whilst offering an alternative which lacks enough of the four components of capitalism namely worker created social and economic value, contract choice and consent to make the new socialist offering both viable financially and fair. The left talks about “ending austerity” without recognising that if your economy lacks the productive capacity to create value, you have nothing of value to re distribute. The usual response is that the government can borrow or nationalise the banks and just about everything else. State borrowing however is unfair as it places the greatest burden for repayment onto the poorest and drives the cost of borrowing up too; hardly Robin Hood. Nationalisation creates a perverse parallel universe in which the benign State becomes the malign capitalist owner of the means of production. Along with other nationalised industries the whole economy slowly becomes a calcified job creation scheme producing nothing that people want other than unproductive government jobs. Socialism is basically a wealth redistributive arrangement. It took a while but in Europe we have learnt that governments do not make good capitalists. In the past these government capitalists created too little economic value. Look at Russia in the 1950s to 1990s the economy raced to the bottom from its high point in the 1930s. Far from “all property being theft” “all property becomes debt”……exactly as it is now and we in the UK are could not cope with more, no really we could not.\nOnce the economy is under the control of the government there is a massive reduction is the amount of Choice, and Consent there is around and indeed the whole “free” basis upon which the capitalist system operates becomes eroded. Rights diminish and the system run by technocrats or so-called experts rather than the people, guide the social and moral agenda. Therefore, lovers of totalitarian ideas from fascists to Jihadists love socialism and these groups hatred of capitalism is why socialists love them back.\nNow arguably when the left talk about economic reform or identify problems with the current economic model they may have moved away from full on nationalisation. But within socialism the belief that governments know best prevails and limits progress. This desire to put government in control is the slippery path from capitalism to socialism as bureaucratic authoritarianism; top down, lacking progress, and prone to collusion, corruption and coercion. The perfect cocktail to undermine freedom anyone could possibly come up with.\nIn this slippery world of Sepp Blatters’ and corrupt regimes, to lose sight of Contract, Choice and Consent and replace them with more incompetent government and a bankrupt redistributive economic model is folly indeed.\nAnd finally the EU is precisely the kind of “government” that is unproductive and bureaucratic, run by technocrats and therefore should be seen for what it is a fanciful 20th century form of bureaucratic authoritarianism. Not progressive at all really……not now.\nSo Russell Brand had a point and if you are still with us, you will recognise that the answer to his problem is not to overthrow all that is capitalism or to replace it with all that is socialism. The answer is a Blue Collar Blue revolution.\n21.01.16 The life of economic value. Where does it end up?\nIn the west some of us delight in the world of the celebrity; we love the antics of Paris this or Justin that and the world of the acting and celebrity profession somehow adds glamour and gravitas to the view that the world is so unfair and poor people need glittery advocates to promote their interests; at no actual cost to the “profession” itself of course. The acting profession and the Z listers who clutter up the day time TV slots and magazine racks have become good at skimming off a hefty chunk of what little economic value the western world creates. The mechanism involves magazines, films and television as well as the new trend for you You Tube celebs offering advice on all things trivial.\nThere is clearly nothing wrong with the entertainment profession; the western world has enjoyed poetry, song and theatre for centuries, and now enjoys Film, TV and Radio. However when one considers that the business of creating value is typically down to those who actually toil in fields and factories with the bankers (services nor speculation) and some of the high export earning celebs (Beatles etc) coming up the rear with foreign earnings (Jeremy Clarkson!) it is clear the vast majority of those celebs who make wealth out of the economic system we call the “free market” are simply acquiring the spoils of other peoples debt, welfare and welfare supported earnings, for little of any discernable value to the individuals concerned. The question is this; is this justified?\nWell whether it is justified depends on your vantage point in respect of wealth and how it is created and then acquired. If as many do, one takes the view that the way wealth is created and is acquired does not matter “one is relaxed about wealth” as one new labour stalwart commented, then the fact that the poorest members of the community are wasting money on frivolous rubbish will be of little concern as long as someone is getting wealthy. If however one takes the view that the stewardship of what ever income or wealth one has (whether it is from earnings or welfare) is very important if one is, as one should be, serious about providing for ones family, one should be saddened about the celebrity culture in the west and the waste that goes with it.\nSo if the likes of Paris that and Justin this start to wonder about the “global hegemony” they needs to look no further than their excessive earnings, acquired largely at the expense of the poor and misguided, to see how they could do their bit to help to sort out the West’s social and economic malaise; they could stop talking stop preening and get a real job.\n30.01.16 Does the world need Britain more than Britain needs the EU.\nThe battle for the votes of the British people in their much fought for referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU is beginning to take shape. It promises to be an emotional campaign full of the usual fury and righteous indignation, shonky statistics, falsehoods exaggerations and half truths on both sides delivered by a collection of “Big Guns” who sell the “concept” in or out one way or the other. This will be a campaign short on facts and honest argument.\nStuck beneath this thick adversarial froth with be the British people, required to take sides with little understanding of what is really at stake. So to get some thoughts in early we thought we would give some pointers as to how we feel at a Blue Revolution.\nWe always talk about “Value” rather than its liquid and easily produced derivative “Wealth”. Value is to economic survival what water is to physical survival. We have consistently argued that how a person country or empire produces value and who gets to control it is absolutely fundamental to understanding how that nation is constructed and more importantly how it works; namely to who’s advantage.\nWe have written about the EU before likening it to a feudal system and imploring people to consider what might happen if the EU gets too well established by say a British yes vote and like all systems an eventual fight to survive might ensues in the face of contradictions emerging. The EU will twist and turn and diminish people power to survive. Now it is time to develop that argument a little further.\nEveryone with a basic education has heard of the aristocracy; these are the people who wield power and to secure their position acquire a nations surplus value (essentially its valuables) based smply on their inherited rank, many will have heard of a theocracy, people who within a faith based rank structure achieve pretty much the same thing and finally the plutocracy a system of power based on who has money or can control money. All are autocratic.\nAs we point out money and value are not the same thing. You can create a lot of money with very little value so a Plutocracy is not the same as an aristocracy but through their wealth the plutocrat controls society rather than through rank as it is with the aristocrat. However power is still wielded top down.\nPost war Europe needed some overarching governance arrangements to ensure that it did not slide back towards armed conflict. Imagine a post war Europe, small nation states decimated by armed conflict twice within 50 years. The EU was an aspiration based on the desire to co operate and build strength through trade and a strong single market. Unfortunately just as all our other “ocracies” have had their day the EU quickly achieved the zenith of its original aim and then settled back into becoming a bureaucracy, and then from that it became a publicsectocracy.\nThis is a Blue Revolution word made up by us at Blue revolution to describe a society where the vast amount of social and economic value is controlled by a public sector paid for by the tax payers. This society consumes value because it has to keep its bureaucrats in work. The question is; does modern Europe still require this bureaucracy, is the work of the bureaucrat still essential as it was when post war Europe needed rebuilding, can we afford to keep this Bureaucracy fed with taxpayers cash? As a substitute for the bureaucracy we have proper trading agreements, a shared understanding of the importance of autonomy among nation states, and we have got over the neurosis of the last two wars, at least in economic terms. We trade with consent, choice and contract so essentially people understand how to operate in a civilised way….we would therefore argue; we no longer need the EU…….no one in Europe does!\nThe argument we would further advance is that the world needs more trade and co operation by those who create the social and economic value beyond the boarders of Europe, Africa and the Middle East for example. We need much less of this unaccountable EU bureaucracy which employs people on inflated salaries, salaries that don’t add social or economic value but is simply personal wealth for the recipients, who as individuals deliver little if anything of any economic worth.\nIn the same way we have thrown off control by feudal overlords and the clergy we should vote against more control by publicly employed Eurocrats and their form of autocracy their EU, a massive publicsectocracy. Down with another ocracy!!!\nThe world can trust the peoples of Europe to co operate and to trade with each other and other nations beyond Europe; spreading the language of trade and co operation based on Contract, Choice and Consent.\nBritain needs to lead the way to a truly global approach to trade by voting “no” to the EU and thus “no”, to yesterday bureaucratic solution to tomorrows global problems. The world needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU and the people of Europe need Britain to vote out to get the blue revolutionary ball rolling.\n01.02.16 Blue Revolution as seen from space.\nAstrounaughts have been quoted as saying on their first orbit of the earth they talk about their nations, the second orbit their continents and the third their conversation turns to discussion about the world. They become it seems shamelessly internationalist.\nInternationalism is usually associated with two ideologies; firstly Marxism lays claim to the original internationalism. The global rise of the proletariat. A few Trots still cling to the idea that there will one day be a Marxist revolution that will encompass the whole world. But modern experience suggests to us at A Blue Revolution that there is little chance of this happening when the recent experience of red revolution is a “vanguard” or revolutionary people of vision, become the government. When government is seen as the means by which “revolutionary” change comes about out democracy goes out of the autocratic window.\nIslamism is the second pretender to the Internationalist throne. But whereas aspiring internationalist governments typically usher in an autocratic system similar to the feudal system, Islamism on the basis of recent experience ushers in Chaos and delivers horror on an industrial scale without even the small scale legitimacy conferred on an actual tribe.\nWhen the spacemen and women are looking at the world they become immune to the nature of the political reality on this planet.\nHowever we at a Blue Revolution have taken the view that it is possible to be “internationalist” without being either a government with feudal aspirations or a rag tag army of jihadists. We rely instead on the fact that more and more people on our blue planet have had their humanity and values installed by capitalism and therefore understand that human relationships both intimate, inter personal and legal are based on Contract, Choice and Consent. The western worlds legacy to our blue planet.\nWith these three harmless words emblazoned on the banners of the revolution (as opposed to their alternatives; corruption, collusion and coercion) people can begin to evaluate their contribution to the cause of Blue Internationalism with its underpinning fairness and equality.\nInternationalism cannot be delivered by governments or quasi superstates like the EU….Their role is to protect individual people and businesses who are operating from within their jurisdictions thus promoting trade. This process of trade will eventually extend to people from other nations for the benefit of mankind.\nAll freely trading nations lift their people out of poverty and move their societies towards greater freedom and democracy for all. The only word of caution has to be that to achieve this internationalist goal there has to be a moral dimension to the “global free market” which does not encourage actions which promote moral decline. Our seven deadly sins and secular westernism sum up these risks. However with the renewed prospect of real social and economic value being created through co-operation between real economies by real working people as opposed to bureaucrats there will be less need to manufacture “wealth” (ie by QE) wealth which ends up in the hands of plutocrats like “Donald Trump” and Hugh Heffner.\nWhen David Bowie sang “planet earth is blue and there is nothing I can do” we would respond with; yes there is, look at the planet and join a blue, as opposed to red or even green revolution. In today’s toxic world only ours is truly internationalist revolution…….but also perfectly safe.\n04.02.16 The EU must accept Brexit…its progressive.\nWe sometimes disagree at a Blue Revolution. Like everyone in our neck woods the EU is testing us. Some of us were solidly in and others solidly out. But overall the arguments in and out are on the basis of different parts of the debate argued simultaneously and there are further splits generationally.\nYounger people are on the whole pro EU seeing the economics of membership as essential to the survival of the UK. Statistics are used in the argument which are compelling and suggest that the possible consequences of Britain leaving the EU would be economically catastrophic. There is little evidence that this catastrophe is likely to happen….but it is a strong an powerful argument. Alongside it is the power and influence argument; we would loose power and influence if we left. On the other side of the debate we have older people who perhaps measuring the changes brought about since our membership of the EU sense that things are not quite as they expected them to be; too much immigration; too much power transferred to the EU too many restrictions and regulations.\nThe problem with this dichotomous debate is that it lacks a certain vision on both sides, but this lack of vision is without doubt most pronounced on the “out” side. Young people like vision. It is therefore from the perspective of the young a case of “In” is progressive and evolutionary and “out” is little Britain in decline. The “Out” campaign has nothing with which to build what seems to be their limited “out” vision, aside from memories of the 1970’s and echoes back to Parliament as sovereign. Thus the Out campaign is characterised by its opponents as being led by wonks, anoraks and weirdo’s and looses credibility as a result.\nAt a Blue Revolution we are people who like to think of ourselves as visionary so for us the reality of “out” is not quite so simple as unhappy feelings and a few historical facts. Here is why.\nBritain was the first nation to industrialise and to drive capitalism throughout the world via its trade links with her empire. Elsewhere the industrial revolution began to send out into the world via industrialisation the keys principles of capitalism Contract, Choice and Consent. Contract, Choice and Consent are the building blocks of all free s0cieties or societies that aspire to be free.\nThe legacy of Capitalism (apart from Contract Choice and Consent) was to generate economic “value” in quantities that would have been mindboggling to simple tribal peoples. The combination of man, materials and machines made everyone better off and as importantly made life more certain. However some people got very rich and this gave rise to demands for the “product of the workers labour” to be more equally distributed. This would not happen out of choice, all property might be theft but there was no authority who could take it away and re distribute it, at least not until the 20th Century.\nEventually socialism in the form of the state took over in the UK and governments of all colours began, via taxes and benefits, nationalisation and state control to “redistribute” value and empower the working class. To do this ministries were set up and people employed to deliver the state objectives. This process cost money and eventually it began to cost too much and deliver too little so in the UK a general drift away from state control began under the Conservatives in the 1980’s and continues, sort of, today\nWhilst this growth of socialism was going on in the Uk after the war, on the continent, wounded countries came together to achieve peace and prosperity by doing a very similar thing; creating a bureaucracy to manage relationships and economies to ensure peace between people, groups and countries. This process grew into the EEC and then EU and is still seen as an evolutionary process even though the process has really reached its zenith and has started to impede the Evolution of global free trade. Global trade that will be the liberator of peoples beyond Europe.\nThe “Internationalist” Blue Revolution vision therefore cannot come easily from a large mono ethnic and class based bureaucracy that controls many diverse and economically distinct and unique economies. But whilst that is a problem for many it does not have to be the way things are done. No European country needs this Bureaucracy to protect them and to “do their business” and “mediate” for them. They all have a deep awareness of the need to create value by respecting Contract Choice and Consent as the basis for freedom, equality and democracy. The Europe of the 21 century could safely desolve its super state and pass control back to its many nation states. This will promote the worlds next phase of evolution “Internationalism”; taking trade and co operation to the rest of the trading world thereby promoting through trade, freedom, equality and democracy and achieving greater peace in trade than can be found in war.\nThe EU was a reaction to a specific post war problem, that problem no longer exists and the EU now impedes the worlds economies preventing too many coming together to trade using the common language of Contract Choice and Consent. Britain leaving the EU is not the act of a reactionary “old” country but the evolutionary act of a revolutionary country who wants to break away from the political limits of its own continent and go out into the world to trade and trade with confidence.\n05.02.16 The US might introduce socialism with Bernie S but let us hope they preserve self respect and personal responsibility unlike the UK version.\nSocialism is a phase of social evolution identified by Karl Marx which within a Marxian paradigm is the “negation” of “capitalism”. In the west we still occasionally refer to “capitalism” as though our capitalism is the “Capitalism” that Marx would have recognised. Thankfully that capitalism no longer really exists. There are many complex reasons for this but the biggest killer of “Capitalism” has been the drift in the 20th century away from the capacity of “capitalists” to create economic “value” and the drift towards the new obsession with debt based “wealth”. This debt based wealth funds consumer spending or as it is better known “consumerism”. We no longer ask how much value does something have? we ask how much wealth or money can you get from trading it?\nCapitalism was and will always be about creating economic value its inherent unfairness or “contradiction” was that this value created by labour was misappropriated by “Capitalists”. This no longer happens, at least not in the west. The demise of “Capitalism” and the intervention of government have changed the nature of western economies. Initially in Britain there was full on Socialism with state ownership of the means of production; now there is just welfare.\nSocialism in the early to mid 20C and mainly in Europe was the point at which the state began a redistributive programme; taking value from the “Capitalists” and reallocating it through state ownership, health programmes and welfare to the workers. In Marxist terminology the government is giving more of the workers economic value back to them. It started in the UK after WWII.\nThe problem for the west is that the western economies no longer create value in anything like the quantity necessary to support all the welfare and health obligations to which they have committed themselves . We export our value creating requirements to China and within the “free market” the banking system and governments generate debt based wealth. Therefore we only seem to be able to support our people on the proceeds of debt…it is a kind of economic subterfuge; it looks like an economy based on real value but hold on, what’s this underneath it looks just like…….oh my god is it really just cash and personal wealth based on a pile of over-priced houses, stock, collateralised debt obligations and quantitative easing? Yes I’m afraid that is all it is. Welcome to post- industrial economics.\nDelivering “socialism” in the US in something that is long overdue. The likes of Trump, Heffner, Buffett et al simply benefit from debt backed wealth. So whilst Capitalism no longer exists to be “negated” this unfair US system with its strutting coiffured buffoons who somehow benefit more of the proceeds of the nations debt than any one else, needs to be tackled. The workers of the US have had their noses rubbed in it for long enough.\nIn a debt based economy there should be an equality in how much of other peoples debt you benefit from.\nSo US socialism will be debt not value based. In that sense it is like the UK welfare system is now. Debt not value is the contradiction in modern socialist type systems. Debt will eventually overwhelm the Euro zone too and slowly re shape the EU and possibly even the US.\nHowever a word of warning; as part of a “socialist programme” welfare should be a net to catch those in need, not a trap to keep them enslaved to welfare. Any US welfare system should therefore preserve self respect and self reliance and should avoid creating entitlement. failing to promote or maintain self respect and self reliance amongst too many welfare recipients is the problems with British welfare and it therefore undermines any attempt to get back to a more egalitarian “value” based economy. An eonomy where real economic value and real social value are created. An economy which balances the creation of social and economic value whilst preserving personal responsibility one might identify with as blue revolutionary.\n.",

How does it work?\nWe will develop this later but it is about a few simple things; social and economic value and how it is created, controlled and allocated. It not difficult stoopid!\nThe issues of culture, cultural convergence and cultural relativism have to be understood or debated with common reference points. If not, confusion reigns as arguments are held which have common terms which unfortunately mean different things to different groups or cultures. It is essential that in the twenty-first century and particularly in the post capitalist, western post industrial period we gain some narrative which has a widely agreed objectivity so we can ensure that we don’t sacrifice our hard grafted for western liberty on the gilded altar of a neurotic moral relativism. Because this is going on now, unchallenged and utterly misunderstood. Simply look at the different ways “equality” is used around the world, particularly in relation to women’s rights.\nIf we deal with the world’s non-western cultures, and we won’t specify them but let’s just say they are the ones that discriminate on what we have come to know in the west as “improper” grounds, we find there is a lot of inhumane behaviour much of it state sanctioned, much of it a throw back to the primitivism that it was Capitalism’s destiny to sweep away. We have come to overlook this by adopting the stance of the moral relativist. Adopting this approach FGM is no different to a Boob job or a western contract based marriage no different from polygamy. They are legitimate or illegitimate versions of the same things. When there is a clash, for example, the death penalty for “sorcery” we turn a blind eye…..we have no narrative either to understand this or challenge it so we ignore it and the pathetic plight of those condemned by it.\nThe West has lost its moral leadership cowed by shrill claims of moral imperialism. The reason we have lost our humanitarian voice (except when talking to ourselves) is that we have lost touch with what makes and shapes morality….and that is economics transforming often barbaric holy books. It doesn’t matter whether it is tribal economics or advanced post industrial debt dependent consumer economics, economics shapes our moral parameters.\nBecause most “liberals” don’t understand the role of economics in moral behaviour they can’t create a narrative which helps us understand the traditional culture’s hatred of behaviour like homosexuality nor our western tendency to promote it. We can’t look traditional people in the eye whether here or in their country of origin and ask them whether they understand why they think our culture is immoral, or what it is about our culture they are most appalled by. We just don’t go there perhaps because we can’t face having our nieve belief that everything in the world is fine and “liberal” challenged by the opinions of “disadvantaged” ethnic groups who will shout “post colonial” at us if we challenge their moral perspective.\nThe only way to avoid being accused of racism or equally to avoid turning a blind eye to abuse of minority lifestyles in “traditional” cultures is to have a grounded narrative. A narrative upon which a debate can be found which avoids stereo types, or a mere race and ethnicity based slanging match but which draws out safe debate with people who harbour prejudicial views from whatever cultural origin including western culture. The basis for this narrative has to be economics as this is not only relevant territory for a healthy debate it is safe territory, at least it should be in the 21st century. Later we will examine how this relationship between economics and culture works. As we said above it is about value both social and economic. Is it as Marx suggested the riddle of history solved!\nFor too many decades now the west has failed to grasp that it’s unique offering to the world was its capitalist system. Loved and reviled in equal measure, those who loved it loved the wealth it conferred through its capacity to deliver massive volumes of economic value or profit. Those who hated it hated it because this economic value was created according to the left by “stealing” value from the workers. This “capitalist” system, the ability by risk taking capitalists to mix land, labour and capital to create profit was in terminal decline at the outbreak of WWII and was extinct we believe by the 1980’s.\nCapitalism however shaped the British nation and the British nation shaped the world or much of it. The capitalist system needed and got a legal contractual foundation free of corruption, it required consent and it required the right to make choices. The Corn Laws were and early battle by capitalists against state vested interests as perhaps Brexit for Brexiteers is today.\nthe contract, choice and consent basis that capitalism needed to thrive eventually took on what is called a “social character”. It moved from being merely legal or economic to being the bedrock of what is now the welfare system with its obligation to distribute wealth, as well as becoming the basis of the “free market”.\nEveryone in the west has freedom in enormous quantities, born of a capitalist system generations of westerners have grown up with and fought to preserve. We cannot imagine our freedom being under threat. But it is. It is because to accept it, you have to understand it and its origins in capitalism. Something the “stoopid” European and British “left wing” don’t get.\nIn the UK in Europe, Australia, Canada and America we have brought large numbers of people into our country who have no heritage of choice, consent and contract. When there is no consent in the west a crime is committed but in many cultures that escaped the furnace of 18th to 20th-century capitalism, consent is either a decadent idea or an utter irrelevance. These cultures know where consent is allowed to be practised and where it is not. Like wise with contract and choice. You cannot consent or choose to be Gay for example.\nThe final issue is about value. Before you can stop any culture practising discrimination against minority “lifestyles” that culture needs to produce sufficient “economic value” to survive changes to the way society is organised. A simple, primitive culture, namely one that does not create much economic value (pumping it out of the ground and selling it doesn’t count) will punish those perceived to be undermining the social and economic system. Thus gay people or those women who fail to observe a pre determined social role will be punished.\nWe hope this makes sense and readers can understand that capitalism liberated us and should not be condemned. We also hope the left wing will understand that by continuing their war on capitalism (even though it no longer really exists) they are waging a war on contract, choice and consent and playing into the hands of the primitive cultures for whom our freedoms are a theological and sociological abomination and our moral relativism is our Achilles heel.\nThe final point to ponder is this; we no longer create value in the west either social or economic, we create wealth…money. how long will our culture last therefore irrespective of the forces railed against it?",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_for-those-who-would-like-a-better-understanding-of-economic-determinism-or-why-are-things-as-they-are/content_308.html": "For those who would like a better understanding of Economic Determinism, or why are things as they are?\nWe are as ordinary people often given religious advice by many theologians of ‘faith’. Often the advice is anodyne, be nice to each other that kind of thing and sometimes it might be a little less nice, kill the non-believer for example. These theologians will, of course, argue their faith is the true faith and that you should follow them. What of course they won’t tell you is that faith is the product of economic circumstances. They won’t say that because they don’t believe it. Religion comes from heaven and not the earth upon which we walk they will say.\nThat may be a hard concept to grasp at first. Well, let us explain it like this. Imagine a world where you had to steal from other groups just to survive. You would be imagining a world that hasn’t really existed for at least 2000 years but has existed in the past. You have just imagined the ‘economic circumstances’ and pretty rotten they are too! Such a world would kill with little mercy. You don’t want many male prisoners but some women and girls would help to build your tribal strength. You would have no concept of rights. It would simply be to kill or be killed, submit and obey. ‘Ownership’ would be by possession. The man, and of course back then warriors were only men, would acquire ownership without a “contract” they took what they wanted and that as we have said included people, so no “rights” either. To our way of seeing things, this is scary stuff. Sparta in Greece was like this in antiquity and other places were too. It was a common phenomenon for early humanity and it was called by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels ‘Barbarism’. It is easy to see why.\nHaving established the economic circumstances, we have will have behaviours that reflect those economic circumstances, such as killing, stealing and owning by violence, punishing with cruelty. To make sure this system worked one would need some ‘morality’. A morality that reflected the harsh material circumstances and justified the brutal behaviour. It would serve two functions it would unite people and also ensure that stealing and fighting were accepted as a way of life under strict conditions. You could not steal from each other for example.\nThere is a line in the film ‘Salmon Fishing in the Yemen’ where they take farmed fish and put them is a tank of water. The water is still and the fish swim everywhere. However, once the water flows the fish swim against the current and once character remarks “ah it is in their nature”. The theologians of faith would like us to believe that their expectations of us are “in our nature” so that we submit to their teaching. Often, they will talk about issues to do with sex and gender, so it looks like things might be ‘in our nature’. But we are not farmed salmon. We, economic determinists, say there is no ‘human nature’ just the beliefs and values that relate to the economics of various periods in history, promoted as still relevant today in the form of religion. You may have ‘spirituality’ but religion is a way of shaping that spirituality to the advantage of an ancient or in the case of modern ‘bourgeois’ Christianity more recent economic elite.\nToday we have morality and laws derived from the values of capitalism to thank for our way of life, bourgeois morality as Karl Marx called it. It is the most modern morality, but even it is it is becoming out of date as our economies in the West take a turn for the worse. With capitalist morality came contract, choice and consent, which in turn gave us our freedom and an 18th-century democracy. It took a while to throw off older pre-capitalist values like gender, faith or racial inequality, but in the end, we did and now our rights reflect our ‘economic’ circumstances, the capitalist inspired free market.\nSo, we can stop worrying then? Well yes and no. The free market like the capitalist system itself needs real value derived from hard productive work to survive but now it is on the life support machine of debt. Our modern ‘bourgeois’ bankers, elite politicians in US or EU etc can see that our ‘economic circumstances’ are weakening by the decade, so they will want to maintain their power whilst controlling us in an impoverished economic situation. A State managed debt dependent ‘free market’ will have to have a new morality and at its core won’t be contract, choice and consent, we will have to behave or else. There are signs this is starting to happen now, and there are religions that can see an opening for a new kind of oppression, handy when our Nation has been bankrupted by our State elites and people are angry. Unless we use our hard-won capitalist values wisely we will undermine the case for them and someone will come along and challenge their legitimacy. Then we will all be in trouble…a sort of pre-seventeenth century trouble too…..nasty.\nNext weeks second (and final) post in this series will look at how we as individuals can use contract, choice and consent in a way that ensures their survival and preserves our freedom. And yes it is determined economically and in a collapsing western economy.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_what-is-wrong-with-the-british-public-sector/content_75.html": "What is wrong with the British Public Sector?\nWhat is wrong with the public sector?\nMost people feel that the public sector is in crisis, with low staff morale, poor service delivery and too much bureaucracy. The question is can anything be done to improve things and what is the cause of the vast array of problems it faces?\nThe Public Sector used to be an eccentric collection of largely autonomous departments of State and Local Government. It was efficient and whilst Salaries were low compared to similar posts in the private sector, the work carried a pension which was seen by staff as giving long-term security. people were also loyal to the concept of public service. Much of the Public Sector from the 1940s to the 1980s reflected the values of the post-war settlement. The Public Sector was financed by taxation for the benefit of everyone. Its basic values therefore would have tilted towards equality, fairness plus accountability, not to a bureaucratic elite but to elected representatives on Boards and committees. The public sector, therefore, tilted away from principles of elitism in favour of functionalism that delivered services to the public. This all started to change with the arrival in the 1980s of a growing belief that the model was inefficient because what went on was largely immeasurable. It coincided of course with the development of data. and growing faith in the ability of free market principles of unfairness, inequality and particularly managerial elitism, to deliver better measured and managed services to the public, but at what cost to the staff? Let us explore what has happened from Prime Ministers Major to Johnson via Blair and Brown.\nA characteristic of the old public sector, therefore, particularly in local authorities was that it tended to have hierarchies with few levels within its hierarchies, between those at the top and those at the ‘delivery end’. The system worked because everyone knew their role within departments and they had clearly defined professional boundaries, within which they operated autonomously. They had time to become experts at what they did. As they were relatively flat hierarchies, career progression was the exception rather than the expectation. Those who did ‘get on’ usually did so on the basis they were knowledgeable and experienced, generally respected, and likeable. All very simple.\nSince then, however, there have been significant developments changing the culture and nature of the public sector. These changes are based on a belief that the public sector required free-market principles to make it efficient. It has gone from being a simple collection of diverse but skilful departments, staffed by experienced professionals, into a data, training obsessed, and micromanaged behemoth that no longer serves the needs of those who work in it or those who rely on it and of course pay for it..\nSo, what has gone wrong? When the public sector was being expanded or in some instances ‘nationalised’ after the Second World War the only organisational model in existence was the industrial business model. The industrial business model, based as it is on capitalist principles has elitism and unfairness characterised by top-down control of workers. However, the layers of management and ancillary departments support whatever is the core business activity of the organisation.\nAny manufacturing firm may need Human Resources, training, and finance departments, or it can buy these in from elsewhere. All these ancillary roles create costs but must not impede key business. They must continue to allow control of business risk from the Board of Directors at the top, through managers to ensure the prosperity of the firm. Altogether the aim is efficiency, making a successful firm that makes a profit, can support its ancillary departments, take risks, and not spectacularly fail.\nIn the earliest iteration of the public sector (I am excluding the military which has structures requiring different command and control needs) the application of this industrial model, whilst ‘top down’ was reasonably flat and lightly managed. Profit wasn’t a preoccupation. It didn’t need to be. Workers were classified by their role for example practitioner or senior practitioner of this or that department, and a Chief Officer with maybe a couple of ranks in between, maybe a deputy to the Chief Officer. All colleagues would know the purpose of the department they worked in and would gain decades of experience in, for example, protecting children, managing offenders, providing housing, maintaining highways or upkeeping Parks and Gardens. From the 1940s until the end of the twentieth century this model worked reasonably well but even back then did and still does have difficulties that have been used by a newly created public sector elite to define its failures today.\nFirst among the old public sectors difficulties was that the model had no inbuilt ‘check’ on inefficiency, such as loss-making, or going bankrupt as is the case in the private sector. But given the public service values back then this was less of an issue. Wages were typically lower than in the private sector. In the past, the public sector and private sectors were recognised as different, with very different sets of values.\nOnce the public sector was uncoupled from its quaint ideas of public service or ‘vocation’ the new commercial ethos introduced bit by bit by Governments from the late 1980s onwards, has spawned not efficiency but bureaucracy and oppressive management. The public sector and its workers were never inefficient enough to justify the imposition of commercial principles. But that didn’t stop the trend from gaining momentum.\nThe aim of introducing a kind of free market discipline was to ensure that worker performance could be monitored, measured, and therefore managed. No longer does a local team deliver a service, knowing what is required of it by an informed public, the whole process is overmanaged by ‘Boards’, senior managers, and performance analysts. These people are remote from the front line, promote their career ambitions and create growth in non-core areas of business such as irrelevant training which leads to muddle, anxiety, and a loss of focus on what ‘core’ activity is.\nTo each ‘head’ or senior ‘leader’, their bit of activity within the organisation can be treated as a ‘core’ activity, whether that activity is ‘core’ i.e., Protecting Children from Harm, or less ‘core’ activity such as training staff, managing Human Resources, Data Management, or Quality Assurance. The actual core business gets lost among too many priorities. Department heads in the public sector now compete for resources, human and financial, keen to secure ‘investment for their bit of the organisation.\nThe next key problem for the public sector is the development of the accountability framework as a substitute for the health check of profit and loss in a private firm.’ If in the private sector core business is disinvested in, company losses will follow. Accountability frameworks inflicted on the public sector by successive governments since the late 1980s don’t work in the same way. When core staff can see problems but have no power to resource core business, it causes stress and crisis on the front line. The consequence of this model is staff being overmanaged to deliver unachievable targets for the organisation and the organisation’s bonus-obsessed ‘senior leaders. Absence and disillusionment quickly become systemic.\nThe response from management is More training and accountability to cope with problems caused by accountability colliding with a lack of staff at the critical delivery end. So why do we have accountability models that are so oppressive?\nAccountability would have less impact if it were not for the existence of ‘Data’. Data has ruined Public Service delivery. It has created an environment where people who deliver the core business are subservient to process and people who collect data, apply standards that require monitoring and inspection and who undertake quality assurance for the benefit of senior management.\nIt is at this point that an almost Marxian‘ contradiction’ can be seen. The most important people in an organisation who deliver core business become less important in attracting resources, sometimes because they fail to hit targets due to a lack of relevant staff. The measurers, weighers, trainers, and middle and senior managers take precedence, as they protect and justify the organisation’s performance.\nFront-line staff become mere cogs in an alienating, data-based, and micromanaged process. This turns professional decision-making into ‘expected standards’ within a generic ‘accountability’ framework. It renders the ‘coal face’ and core business, a stressful and toxic environment from which everyone wants to escape because the demands are too high, the risks are too great and the rewards too little. But then with no public service ethos, what are the reasons to enter the challenging public sector coal face? Put bluntly, promotion and higher salaries, or a move into an ancillary role.\nThe Public Sector’s insatiable demand for public money usually means that money is forthcoming when needed, particularly in high-profile services like Health. However, this extra money all too often gets ploughed into more management oversight and accountability, Quality Assurance, or training. In effect, it does nothing to tackle the problems experienced by coal face practitioners who get more and more stressed whilst other qualified colleagues on the same wage, monitor, evaluate, or criticise their performance with the aim of protecting the organisation.\nThis is the reality for too many front-line public sector workers. Their workplace is stressful, and the core business is poorly resourced, relative to ancillary tasks and management. After the continued prevalence of management expanding to achieve greater organisational control and accountability, there are other major problems with the delivery of public services. This next issue is perhaps the one that has arisen since the Millennials became the aspiring generation.\nThe most significant change in the public sector is the emphasis placed on accelerated promotions based on self-declared competence rather than old-fashioned ‘experience’. This has allowed a younger and more ambitious group of largely inexperienced staff to quickly gain promotion into management including senior management. Competent at ‘intelligence’ and psychometric testing, they enter the public sector for its well-remunerated career structure rather than its core business. Remember management never was a core function.\nIt is not uncommon to hear young people entering public service roles describing an expectation, sometimes born of narcissism, that they will get out of core activity and go into management. The reasons are lower stress levels, and career opportunities elsewhere. This is where they will acquire their career-defining salaries, as opposed to old-fashioned character-defining public service. Beyond the level of core delivery and into senior management salaries and rewards, packages are often more than one hundred thousand pounds per annum whilst some workers who get such salaries are barely experienced and still in their mid-thirties or early forties.\nThis latter point captures the most outrageous ‘contradiction’ in the provision of modern public services, namely the highest salaries are paid to those who take the fewest actual risks. The risk in any public service is at the delivery end, the police officer, nurse, social worker, probation, or housing officer who must manage public expectations whilst exercising authority face to face, which is increasingly becoming the authority to say no to an entitled and expectant public.\nThis difficult and increasingly risky core business does not go on at the level of the senior leaders as they are encouraging us to style them. This is a topsy-turvy world where risk is not rewarded but is actively avoided by promotion away from it, and where remote and meaningless managerial responsibility for the burden of risk carried by others is far too well remunerated. But this is now considered ‘normal’ in the modern Public Sector.\nIt is considered normal because it meets the needs of an ambitious group of career operators who have been encouraged by politicians, employee bodies and the clueless civil service to create the bureaucratic micromanaged public sector as a means of driving an efficiency framework based on accountability but which justifies an ‘elite’ workforce of overpaid managers. The public sector has now removed itself from the core principle of public service which once financed the delivery of services by professionals working directly with and on behalf of the public. It has become a career structure complete with accelerated promotions and plenty of hubris.\nIf this reality was not bad enough, the managerial solutions offered for stress and ‘burnout’ are either the provision of counselling services to build resilience or the patronising Blue Peter-like reward and recognition schemes or ‘shoutouts’ for those who manage to hang on in. Both these miss the point that it is the workplace that is toxic, and it is made worse by the data-driven expectations of over-paid management plus of course the demands of the general public with a growing sense of entitlement..\nIt is this that makes the public sector workplace a toxic environment for too many of those who in diminishing numbers carry the risks of the system. The solution seems to be more data, more scrutiny, more management oversight, and more training. But the public sector’s growing army of little emperors has no clothes.\nSo in summary the public sector’s original post-war values of fairness, equality and service delivery have been replaced by a rapacious free market ethos of unfairness, inequality and elitism, within a newly created management hierarchy that has been created to achieve targets in order to secure funding and in some cases Chief Executives bonuses. No one within this corrosive system apart from the coal-face workers themselves can see anything wrong with this model. The management of this system predictably enough behaves like an exploiting and unaccountable class. When Chairman Mao identified in 1966 that China was developing an elite caste of bureaucratic overseers, remote from the workers he was seeing exactly what we are seeing in the Public Sector today. We don’t need a murderous cultural revolution to deal with it, however just some restructuring and going back to properly funded values of public service and democratically accountable professional public servants.\nSo, how might we achieve this? Well firstly government must not let public sector careerists persuade them that data, accountability, and more management or training is the answer to serious incidents and high-stress levels. It is not, in fact, it is the opposite. We need more qualified and experienced personnel to leave their current ancillary roles or management positions and take their experience back to the coal face. Remove the absurd differentials in salary where workers who carry massive risk do so for little reward, whilst senior managers who carry no personal or professional risk are over rewarded for simply protecting the reputation of the organisation. Rather than a levelling up, what the public sector needs is a levelling down, an increase in coal face workers and a stripping out of strategic management and the costs associated with data collection, needless training and accountability. With massive savings in management costs and the costs of losing big bureaucracy, an enhanced package of pay should be available for those front-line staff who shoulder both risk AND responsibility for the increasingly challenging work in all areas of public service The experiment of the elitist public sector ‘career’ could then be ended, and not before time.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_solving-the-riddle-of-history-simplified/content_366.html": "Solving the Riddle of History.\nIntroduction\nIt was Karl Marx who said Marxism solved the riddle of history. His nineteenth-century analysis explains a lot about the world as we know it today.\nPeople are feeling that the world is going mad. Clashing sets of values and ideas causing anger and outrage. But no one seems to be able to make this situation intelligible. Most theories that try such as Critical Social Justice Theory (1) just make people confused and angry.\nBooks are published on topics as wide-ranging as of the climate crisis, overconsumption, the perils of affluence and the absence of love or community. These issues are all associated with the present state of the West and by implication the state of the whole world.\nA world of vastly different wealth and social and economic expectations will give rise to different ideas about what is wrong and what should be done.\nThe suggestions for solving the world’s vastly different problems all too often involve western people changing our lives, by for example eating less meat, being less stressed, buying less stuff, being more mindful of White privilege, more tolerant, less wealthy, critical of the past or just handing more power over to a state that likes to bully us with political correctness.\nThe question is, why with such a mountain of advice does nothing ever change? Why do we feel so much tension living in the early twenty-first century? Why is it always down to the western worker to change? What, if anything, has the western working class done wrong? Maybe we need to revisit Marx’s riddle of history and try to explain what has happened in the past, and what frightening prospects there might be for the West’s working people in the future unless they, -we- ‘get’ the riddle and avoid being either bullied or seduced by their elites who have adopted fashionable academic theories.\nIn simple terms, nothing changes dramatically because our consciousness changes far more slowly than the events that it must confront. It is largely fixed by our life experience. This is true of everyone in the world, from the tribal areas of Pakistan to the sandy beaches of Southern California. But it is not necessarily true of our ideologically driven elites who are committed to their own self-preservation by whatever means necessary.\nIn Classical Marxism, consciousness is what people think and importantly, why they think it. The tramlines of ‘normality’ which we carry about in our heads and which make us see certain things in certain ways. For Marxists, consciousness is determined by the nature of our economic circumstances and the level of scientific discovery upon which our attitudes are dependent.\nWhy do we, for example, accept women’s freedom and autonomy and some other cultures do not? Why do we value freedom of speech and other nations have blasphemy laws? Why do some people who newly arrive want to change western society so it better reflects their social expectations? What makes violence acceptable to some people to achieve ideological outcomes? It is all about consciousness, theirs, ours, yours, and mine and as significantly the collective consciousness of the people in charge of the structures that govern us, parliament, the law, councils, and courts etc. Let us decode this riddle properly.\nOur consciousness and where it comes from!\nOur economic system and society, plus now the internet and its vast wealth of information, create our thoughts and beliefs but give us no understanding of how that process happens. What makes us behave in the world the way we do? What makes us feel the way we do about the world or the society we inhabit?\nThe collective reality of billions of individual consciousnesses, navigating their world and jostling together is an unavoidable reality for humans, as we are, unlike other creatures, self-conscious animals.\nHumanity makes the world intelligible by creating frameworks for understanding it. We have come to call these, cultures, religions, and ideologies. They promote the benefits of their economic and social systems and protect its vested personal and economic interests, allocating power, and justifying one dominant idea over others. The aim of culture and religion historically is to make inequality intelligible and more importantly acceptable to people, be they citizens, subjects, voters, slaves, workers or whatever.\nTo make society function peoples’ acceptance is needed. In the absence of this, the elite must suppress people’s opposition by force. If the collective consciousness of people is at odds with what they have to accept as their reality, or the justification for their unfair treatment is weak, there will be trouble. Revolution in fact! Are we in such a period now?\nKarl Marx also observed that the history of humanity is the history of economic exploitation, how most people are taken advantage of, and how this is maintained. How does a minority, the elite, get to control the labour-power of the majority and the wealth that labour-power creates, make themselves rich and powerful and stay rich and powerful?\nThe process has involved an interesting cast of characters like Gods and prophets, warlords, books of revealed truths and more recently philosophers, and politicians. It all goes back thousands of years and has led to the promotion of ideas which make the people of the world think and behave in different ways. All to the same end though, to protect the rich by protecting their economic and social power structures. It is not a process linked to race, it is a process linked to class and status.\nThe need to understand the role of consciousness in this process only became relevant once humanity found a way to ‘make a modest profit’ initially on the back of slave labour. In traditional tribal communities, there was no wealth to control, so power structures were irrelevant.\nFor at least four thousand years the profit, created by workers or slaves, has fallen under the control of powerful personal or family interests. In short, the elites of every era.\nWe can look at different cultural influences to see what might inform different social and economic expectations. For example, Islam is an ideology that captures accurately the reality of the harsh seventh century Arab Peninsular. It is a world of warfare and submission to God with strict rules about society and sexual behaviour. The Qur’an (2) promotes this historical reality as the word of God. Today some followers of Islam attempt to introduce ‘God-given’ law by force. Whilst our elite might criticise their methods, and some academics identify cultural ‘disadvantage’, only working people will openly challenge the notion that these ‘laws’ come from God.\nAlternatively, Christianity said we need peace and love. For Jesus, there were enough economic resources going around for everyone to have a reasonable share. The loaves and fishes story illustrates this point (3). So, for Jesus, whilst reality was unfair, kings had more than slaves, he said we should stop thinking about having more for ourselves and think about others; ‘Love thy neighbour’ so to speak.\nThe willingness to ‘believe’ something like the Gospels or the Qur’an, something beyond our actual life experience is another essential component of human consciousness. We are the only animals who can ‘believe’ things which are absurdly not true. This is great news if you want to control people without force. What we believe and why we believe it is what gives us our unique, culturally specific consciousness and its various personal variations.\nWhat consciousness gets downloaded into our heads is complicated, but it is essentially a task for those who control society at any given time. That is until revolution forces change. Today with so much freedom and global communication, societies everywhere are a muddle with all sorts of ideas being promoted and accepted, even ones that are hostile to the concept of personal freedom itself.\nMaybe we no longer know what to believe, so anything goes. Maybe there is a consciousness being engineered to shift the world towards a global consensus. Agreement about what is right and wrong. Or maybe a sort of global consciousness is just emerging nudged by our global elites so that eventually everyone from the rural areas of Afghanistan to the coffee shops of New York will willingly accept it. Consciousness can and does change. Will it be good for western working people of all racial and other backgrounds though?\nSince biblical times economic changes have made people’s consciousness clash with new material realities. In the modern West, these changes have given rise to a freeing up of the rules that once forced us to accept overt control by others. Our modern western world of choices and freedoms allows each of us to create our own rules within the law and decide what we accept as normal. We create personalised ‘normality’. We have a fragmented collective consciousness that reflects our fragmented western world and our fragmented but free and generally tolerant society. But much of the world is not like us. It is not tolerant, or open-minded but why?\nBeing able to construct personal normality has not happened by accident. The economic reality of western society built up over hundreds of years makes it impossible for us not to have evolved our thinking the way we have.\nOur forebears could not have predicted the internet or aircraft travel two or three hundred years ago but how we have used these, is a result of the economic system they created, were all forced to accept, and then promoted as normal. For example, until the eighteenth century, we did not have the freedom to travel abroad. Part of their consciousness, a belief in freedom, became part of our consciousness. We, or more accurately our elites, have taken an eighteenth-century principle and woven it into our modern consciousness. Our elites have created our fragmented individualistic and personalised collective consciousness from what they and we have inherited. It is conceivable that our freedom is not a popular development everywhere in the world.\nIt is up to us to now understand how our individualism might go wrong. How our forbears’ house, once built on stone, has become our house built on the sand of western individualistic ‘normality’. Maybe there is pressure from a global elite to reverse this process. To create a new ‘normal’.\nOur foundations: The Wests Christian consciousness.\nReligion is ideology given the status of the divine or ‘God-given’. It was a trick common in the ancient world, that if you wanted your ideas to be taken seriously, you claimed they were from God and you were a prophet. Christianity went one step further claiming that Jesus was God. The message from first-century Jesus was “I bring you a revolutionary new message, love thy neighbour”. His disciples said, “copy the example set by Jesus in the Gospels”. Fairly simple stuff. Basically, be nice to each other.\nJesus was so out of step with the reality and collective consciousness of the ancient world, characterised by warfare and barbarism that within six centuries his ideas were replaced by more traditional ideas of warfare and submission to God as revealed by Muhammed in the Qur’an.\nBy the time Islam became the regions dominant ideology Christianity was pretty much pushed out of the Middle East and beyond. Christianity made its way to Europe, a wet, cold, and unappealing part of the world of little interest to Arab raiders. The Vikings, who knew the European territory, were responsible for Northern Europe’s seventh-century land grabs, in the name of their God Thor. That is until they converted to Christianity and the ideology of ‘love thy neighbour’ saw their distinct form of longboat barbarism slowly disappear.\nThis idea of love thy neighbour and the story of Jesus born of the Virgin Mary is the first step towards modern western consciousness. It represents the separation of the world of humanity from the world of God. Or in a modern take on the same theme, the separation of the world of human lives, from the world of human ideas.\nIn medieval Europe life was brutal, people suffered at the hands of aristocrats and kings, but the Christian Church ensured that there was always a distinction between humanity and God as represented by Jesus Christ. This separation of religion and the state became accepted as normal.\nThe Bible and Christianity did not combine the world of human conduct and the world of God into a single book of rules or laws. God could forgive even if humans could not. Jesus had died on the cross to forgive humanities sinfulness. This was a radical departure from earlier consciousness as prior to this an individual’s behaviour was laid down as a set of rules with punishments arising from failure to comply, all sanctioned by God. Stoning, for example, appears in both the Old Testament and in the Islamic Hadith. There is nothing like this in Christianity. Morality was more Gods business than humanities. God would sort out the unrepentant sinner in the afterlife.\nExtending this idea of the world of humanity being separate from the world of God, meant that in Christianity, the poor and the pious were willingly encouraged to accept their lot in life because they knew their impoverished earthy life would secure them a place in heaven if they ‘loved their neighbour as themselves’. As the Christian Hymn has it ‘the rich man in his castle the poor man at his gate, God made them high and lowly, and ordered their estate’. Christianity laid the foundation for accepting things as they are. Uncomplainingly, peacefully and with a view to your love for others seeing you enter the kingdom of heaven.\nThis belief in the normality of poverty, the forgiveness of sin, and acceptance of the power of others, based on their use of practices like coercion, and compulsion, defined European consciousness for hundreds of years. Indeed control, coercion and compulsion are, as we will see, the default position for all elites who are not forced to accept freedom as a basic right for everyone.\nBack in Medieval Europe whilst on earth everyone was unequal, by showing love to others, even the rich, you would gain equality with them in heaven. This belief endured for centuries until the Church itself departed from Christian doctrine. The Church failed to follow the word of God.\nThe Christian Church in the form of Catholicism failed to reflect the basic biblical requirement to ‘love thy neighbour’. The Church became bloated, bureaucratic, and self-serving. It was increasingly seen as incapable of extending the love of God to anyone. It became a reflection of earthly power, status, and wealth. The corruptible world of humanity replaced that of love thy neighbour.\nRather than simply tolerate poverty the Church began to create poverty by taking wealth from ordinary people using compulsion and coercion. By doing this the Church departed from the message of the Gospels and gained many critics.\nAn emerging revolutionary Christian elite began creating a new consciousness, and in doing so challenged coercion and compulsion eventually creating consent-based choice or ‘freedom’. This better reflected emerging economic and social reality.\nFreedom would eventually lead to freedom of speech and would allow people to abandon the Catholic Church, create different types of Christianity, and succeed in the world unimpeded by a greedy church or state. Christianity had served the feudal state well by making poverty acceptable to rich and poor alike. But times were changing driven by new economic realities.\nWith an unwillingness to accept centuries of personal poverty as normal, this Christian revolutionary class started to gain strength from the sixteenth century onwards. Over time it changed the consciousness of the political elite, emerging the victorious class by routing feudalism at the end of the seventeenth century. These revolutionaries were called the Bourgeoisie. They created the principles of contract, choice, consent, freedom, and democracy which now form a major part of our modern western consciousness. These principles were known as bourgeois principles.\nWith these principles, the bourgeoisie created capitalism and built a political and legal system supporting their new revolutionary view of consent-based personal choice and freedom.\nTheir new consciousness over time became our consciousness, whether we know it or not, or liked it or not. We value the freedom and consent-based choice they created, which some other ‘rule-based’ cultures do not recognise as legitimate. Our consciousness based on freedom ‘buffers’ with rule-based consciousnesses. Even today political correctness and wokeness challenge concepts of freedom (4). Both are part of a new rule-based ideology, that is attempting to return us to a world of coercion and compulsion in thought, language, and behaviour.\nThe eighteenth-century development of western consciousness founded on consent-based choice or freedom has been unique, formed as it was in a furnace of economic change. Capitalism required freedom in a way that feudalism or slave societies did not. Principles like contract, choice and consent were legal principles underpinning freedom and were ruthlessly defended in the criminal courts of early capitalism. Of course, freedom was not welcomed by everyone. There would be numerous push backs.\nThe feudal system might have kept you powerless and poor, coerced and compelled but the church would give you food or alms and tell you that you would be guaranteed a place in heaven because of your poverty or if you repented of your sins.\nCapitalism created poverty too if you were unable to use your freedom to get rich unlike feudalism, it was happy to let you starve. Alternatively, it would execute you if you stole the private property of others. It was OK to contract for something, but to take it without consent was a capital offence. The courts put on trial thousands of petty thieves who were then executed. Transportation to Australia and the workhouse eventually became the capitalist systems way of treating criminals ‘humanely’.\nEventually the English church by now no longer Roman Catholic, thanks to Henry the Eighth, stopped supporting the poor. Slowly the state stopped using coercion, control and compulsion and embraced a brutal new reality; freedom backed by Protestantism, and all based on contract, choice, and consent. The Protestant work ethic was born.\nPeople were free to become rich and in doing so acquire power, status and influence, but they were also free to starve, to be exploited by capitalists (5) and to experience a hard life of misery and ignorance whilst other people, the bourgeoisie or capitalists got rich.\nGet rich without adopting capitalist principles and it was the hangman’s noose or the debtor’s prison. This early capitalist system was brutal. No wonder people came to hate it so much, people like Lenin (6) and Trotsky (7) who were Russian revolutionaries in the early twentieth century.\nCapitalisms eighteenth and nineteenth-century history remain the benchmark by which the western world’s traditional left-wing view capitalism, even in the twenty-first century. But most on the traditional left, and those who adopt Critical Social Justice Theories have a very crude understanding of capitalism and overlook the fact that like many ideologies, including socialism, it had its good points, like contract, choice, and consent as well as its bad points like continuing to promote status, inequality, and unfairness.\nOf course, whilst contract, choice and consent were getting established as principles underpinning capitalist freedom and democracy for the elite, the old principles of earthly power based on coercion, control and compulsion had not gone away completely. In fact, the economy of the eighteenth century was a confusing mixture of both feudal and capitalist principles with the ‘theory’ of freedom coexisting with the ‘reality’ of compulsion based on the need to avoid starvation.\nIt depended on your social position, as to how much contract, choice and consent or freedom you could enjoy and how much control, compulsion, and coercion you could avoid. Initially, the capitalist class was seen by the poor as worse than the old feudal barons, they at least had provided land to be worked and poverty was a virtue.\nIt has taken centuries for the consciousness of the working people to uncritically accept contract choice and consent. This is because the worker’s economic situation made it impossible for them to exercise what were their legal rights. What made early capitalism so brutal was working people were forced by poverty to ‘freely’ choose coercion and control on pain of starvation for themselves and their families.\nImagine the anger a situation like that would cause. It is this anger that marks the next great stride in our western consciousness. We started to reject the idea that contract, choice, and consent should be used by a greedy economic and political elite to trap us into accepting coercion and control.\nIn Summary\nFor thousands of years, humanity accepted violence and barbarism as a way of life. This violent activity was part of our consciousness, it was tolerated as ‘normal’. In the first century, Christianity adopted a revolutionary way of thinking, ‘love thy neighbour’. This idea was eventually superseded by the re-establishment of more traditional behaviours typical of the area and era such as holy war and rule-based submission to God.\nChristianity moved into Europe and began promoting the idea that we accept our lot in life peacefully, and uncomplainingly, as Jesus had when he died on the cross. This idea of being passive and accepting coercion and compulsion lasted until the church became hungry for power. A new set of economic opportunities and legal principles emerged, contract, choice, and consent. These created the concept of freedom available to an elite and eventually, it gave rise to democracy.\nCapitalisms freedom was brutal. Freedom to starve and if you disobeyed the rules by ignoring contract, choice, and consent and for example stole, the early capitalist state would hang you with little mercy.\nMaking Capitalist values the new normal: A consciousness being born!\nWith the old ways of compulsion, coercion and control being slowly superseded by an implacable application of contract choice and consent, the world was in for a turbulent two hundred years or so. Capitalists, who acquired the power of money, became just like their feudal predecessors, rich and obsessed with status, sitting on top of a political system which looked after their economic interests. They even found ways to rig the anarchy of the capitalist system so they could ape the lifestyle of the old aristocrats. This was the world of monopolies, mergers, and super-profits.\nThe churches stopped assisting the poor emphasising the virtue of hard work, not poverty. A new world was emerging and with it, a new consciousness was being formed. The anarchic early capitalist world of traders and merchants settled down to a new order of inherited privilege, status, unfairness, and inequality. All based on legal principles of choice and consent.\nThe population in the early capitalist world fell into two camps. Those who saw freedom based on contract, choice, and consent as capitalisms most valuable contribution to human life. These people then and now tend to see economic failure as a personal problem caused by fecklessness. Alternatively, there were others who saw contract, choice, and consent simply as ‘bourgeois values’, a way of bullying vulnerable workers into accepting low wages, poor conditions and poverty to make someone else rich under the pretence of ‘freedom’ and liberty.\nThese conflicting views have shaped different forms of consciousness in different parts of the western world. All claim to desire freedom based on consent-based choice but with different levels of control applied by the state, depending on how successfully ‘freedom’ is seen to be making individuals rich.\nBritain was the first properly capitalist country. By the mid-eighteenth century, capitalism was augmented by industrialisation to make Britain powerful enough to create an empire and extend capitalism via trade to much of the world.\nBritain was so wealthy the idea of capitalism needing to use feudal and barbaric principles of compulsion, control and coercion in its economic affairs was challenged, and rightly so. As a result, politicians and thinkers came to argue for constraints upon capitalists, holding them hard to bourgeois principles of contract, choice, and consent. Thus, slavery was challenged and eventually Britain abolished it.\nBritain has helped to confine that disgusting practise to the dustbin of history, at least in the western world. Slavery still prospers as it always has done in countries that allow the powerful to ‘own’ people using control, coercion and compulsion and then steal their labour power for self-enrichment. Labour power rightly belongs to the slave. In capitalism, it is not stolen but ‘contracted’ with ‘consent’ to an employer in exchange for a wage. This is accepted as fair in a free society.\nThe extent of contract, choice and consent being ‘believed in’ among the general population determine a nations political maturity, compared with ongoing belief in earlier power structures like authoritarianism and feudalism. The larger the group who could enjoy freedom based on these principles the freer and more liberated a country could claim to be. The counterpoint, however, is the society would probably remain just as unfair, elitist, and unequal Thus there is a tension between freedom being valued and freedom being challenged.\nBecause early capitalism generally improved the lives of most people, elitism, status, and unfairness eventually became accepted by most. Under mature capitalism, the views of all but the most hardened revolutionary would be, “using freedom based on contract, choice and consent, I too could become rich and have status, be part of an elite and accept unfairness as ‘normal’.\nThis is the world today and it is unravelling before our eyes because the system that underpins it, capitalism is now in trouble. To make capitalism work we now must use personal and national debt, not ‘capital’ (8) as Marx would have understood it.\nCapitalism in crisis is challenging us all to find solutions, it is shaking our confidence in our political and economic system and is reshaping our consciousness. It is possible to detect a trend against personal freedom because freedom is again being blamed for inequality, elitism, and unfairness. The advance of political correctness and wokeness are the ideas at the forefront of this attempt to return to compulsion and coercion to ‘prevent’ economic inequality and unfairness. But as always it will be at the expense of personal freedom.\nApart from a small but growing band of politically correct or woke activists, most westerners now believe in bourgeois values. They associated them with personal success and freedom. In the past, there was a good chance that anyone could achieve some personal success within the capitalist system. Our great grandparents and great, great, grandparents would have measured their success in terms of material comfort, the quality of family life, and the positions they held in the community. They would have accepted that there were ‘their betters’ and that even though life was typically unfair and unequal, they all had a fighting chance to make a good life.\nThe Elitism, inequality, and unfairness inherent within capitalism would have been part of their collective consciousness, but it would have been viewed as the price worth paying for living in a free society. Capitalism is unique in that people consent to their inequality. It is a trade-off.\nBy the nineteen fifties Britain was becoming a nation of individuals defined by a belief in good principles of contract choice and consent and bad but generally tolerated principles of elitism, inequality, and unfairness. It is important to grasp that bourgeois society accepts these six basic ideas in their totality. For Marxists, it is important to emphasise that the purpose of revolution should be to preserve the first three and minimise the impact of the latter three. That is what Marxism promotes. But why has ‘Marxism’ not delivered this reality?\nBy the heyday of western bourgeois values in the nineteen fifties Russia and China’s ‘communist’ revolutions had come and gone and the life of the Russian and Chinese worker was worse than that of the employee in a ‘free’ nation like the United Kingdom or the United States.\nThe problem for the Russians and Chinese people was that unlike their eighteenth-century Western European and United States counterparts, their twentieth-century bourgeoisie like Lenin, Trotsky, and Mao, the leaders of the Russian and Chinese revolutions, had decided that capitalism was a no go area, and so they supported state-controlled industrialisation, without the need to establish freedom through a bourgeois revolution based contract, choice and consent.\nRussia and China rejected capitalism. The political elite did not like the way consent and choice-based freedom had caused poverty in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Who can blame them? Whilst history might judge them as wrong, maybe it was not so mad to try and avoid capitalism if you had seen it in action in the nineteenth-century West, as both Lenin and Trotsky had done. Cruel conditions, low wages, no healthcare, no education for workers, whilst an exploiting bourgeoisie swanned around Europe on the Grand Tour (9).\nBy avoiding choice and consent-based capitalism however, Russia and China oppressed their people, denying them political freedom but guaranteeing them employment in state factories or farms. A gulf eventually developed called the Iron Curtain. After World War Two the world was divided between the free world, the West, and the totalitarian single-party regimes of Russia and China.\nUnsurprisingly the West came to associate Marxism with the Russian Revolution and therefore cruel oppression.\nIt was wrongly claimed that Marxism was the same as Leninism or Maoism. The result allowed western capitalists and politicians to persuade western workers that Marxism was a bad idea and would, just like in Russia or China, take away their freedom as Lenin and Mao had done. Such hostile views preserved the West’s unfair and elitist political and economic system and resulted in status, unfairness, and inequality going unchallenged, particularly in the United States. It reinforced in the consciousness of western workers that only capitalism guaranteed freedom. ‘Marxism’ which had analysed both the good and bad in capitalism, as we have done, was tyrannical because Russia and China were.\nIn Britain, there had been a socialist revolution of sorts after World War Two. Whilst extending the principles of contract, choice and consent to more and more workers, the post-war Labour government also started to end elitism, inequality and unfairness by setting up a Welfare State and providing access to the establishment for working-class children via Grammar schools.\nHealth care, welfare and pensions became available paid by National Insurance. This Labour government made Britain a democratic or ‘free’ socialist country. A country reflecting Marxist principles. The Labour Government too ashamed to admit that their socialism was influenced by Marxism, claimed British socialism was based on Methodist Christianity. Love thy neighbour!\nWhatever the Labour Party claimed, it still did much of what Marx and Engels had urged in their Communist Party ‘Manifesto’ (10) The post-war Labour government attempted to minimise the three bad aspects of capitalism, namely status, unfairness and elitism and extend to more people the good principles of capitalism namely contract, choice, and consent. And it worked until tragedy struck in the nineteen seventies and the bad bourgeois values began to be accepted and embraced by working people and their powerful industrial unions, and again consciousness played a part in this.\nIn Britain, the mature post-war mixed economy of capitalism with democratic socialism was the victim of its own success. It spread its ideology, principles and values creating a society and economy that was as near ‘socialist’ as possible whilst still being capitalist and underpinned by freedom. Sadly, however elitism, status and unfairness are like an infectious disease. Empowered industrial workers in nationalised industries began to focus increasingly on the opportunities to demand preferential treatment and create for themselves a better life than that of other workers. The upshot was that by the nineteen eighties the working class was divided by race, class, industrial-strength, status, and ideology. The last thing needed in the fight against unfairness, inequality, and elitism.\nFar from seeing working people as one powerless mass who should all benefit from state provision and increased democracy, these workers wanted to outdo other workers financially. They turned on the government and taxpayers demanding higher and higher wages. These workers had enjoyed the principles of contract, choice and consent and were now up for a bit of industrial elitism, status, and unfairness. This was the birth of the twentieth-century bourgeois socialist. No surprise their early leaders were called Trades Union barons. More latterly this ideology along with political correctness and wokeness has infected the ‘Left’ who no longer recognise what disadvantage really is or what needs to change to politically empower all working people irrespective of their ‘identity’. So-called Critical Social Justice Theory has only achieved further differentiation of the mass of working people.\nBy the late nineteen eighties individuals began pursuing their own self- interest using contract, choice, and consent in pursuit of elitism for themselves whilst becoming casual about unfairness to others. This became almost a ‘New Labour’ by-line! The bourgeois values that post-war socialism had attempted to minimise, were now driving the personal greed of the so-called free market. The fabric of society was straining as collective values disappeared or became matters of personal choice and political self-interest.\nIn America, a similar process was going on. Labour was getting the edge over ‘capital’. Bourgeois values of self-interest and elitism were undermining any attempt to bring solidarity to working people. Punishment and therefore prison building was the reaction of the American bourgeoisie to any challenge to the American dream or the idea of the land of the free. Socialism or any suggestion of it could destroy careers. Even with a declining industrial base and widespread poverty, America’s collective consciousness remained implacably elitist, unfair, and unequal and for most of the population proudly so.\nHowever, change may be afoot. America the United Kingdom and Europe may be forced to change, as younger voters are becoming concerned about climate change and structural inequality, albeit with a slightly muddled idea about what Social Justice should look like. This may trigger the inevitable shift in America’s collective consciousness. America is not ready for revolution, but it desperately needs something resembling British or European socialism.\nWith capitalism failing and falling into debt the worlds working people will have to pick up the bill. We will inevitably have to develop a new collective consciousness that rids the world of elitism, unfairness, and inequality, whilst striving to extend contract, choice, and consent to countries with a tradition of rule-based coercion and control. But this has massive implications for the western world’s eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century institutions which were not set up to empower ordinary people, just a bourgeois elite.\nThe bourgeois elite now mainly holed up in the arts, media, politics, and the public and civil services will eventually have to tackle a major social and economic problem which according to Marxists is an inevitability.\nWhat do you do when workers are happy to contract, choose and consent but are increasingly unwilling to accept the structural problems associated with elitism, unfairness, and inequality?\nWorking people’s consciousness is beginning to see elitism, inequality, and unfairness as major social problems, which discriminate against all those who are in the middle and at the bottom of the social and economic pile irrespective of their sexual or racial identity.\nThe populism evident in Europe, the vote to leave the European Union, the increasing number of people turning off the British Broadcasting Corporation or refusing to fund it via a licence fee, the rejection of ‘top pay’ for public sector workers in the United Kingdom. And in the United States a violent rejection of bourgeois power structures, all reflect the public’s growing belief that their money is paying for ‘fat cats’ and inequality. Financing with debt a remote elite who by their very existence promotes inequality and disadvantage.\nThe reaction of the global political and economic elite to this new awakening of workers consciousness is predictable. They use their remaining political, and economic clout to create and amplify minor differences within the mass class of working people. They finance Critical Social Justice academics and institutions that promote the idea that there are numerous disadvantaged powerless others. This has created a violent ‘Left-Wing’ groupthink based on the idea that there are numerous victim groups suffering injustice and disadvantage who need empowering, rather than one working-class experiencing mass class disadvantage.\nThis is wokeness. In its demand for political empowerment, it seeks to return us to a society of coercion and compulsion using the language of disadvantage, ‘inclusion’ and injustice. Maybe unintentionally it protects the global elite by taking the emphasis off class consciousness, creating fractious global ‘victims’ continuously at war with each other and their state. Its all good for global business and fuels the need for state control and state spending on ‘security’.\nThe more of these disadvantaged ‘others’ you create, the less likely that anyone single group of workers will be large enough to demand the dismantling of elitism and unfairness within the worlds political and economic system. Elitism and unfairness from which politicians and the economic elite benefit, whether it is in Europe or the Kingdoms of the Middle East, Russia, or China.\nThe aim of social progress should be to extend to all workers contract, choice, and consent to the point where it is so widespread and well understood that inequality, elitism, and unfairness is seriously tackled and replaced by cooperation, collaboration, and consensus.\nThe problem with any attempt to stifle social progress and prevent the expected reduction in elitism, unfairness and inequality is that people from all groups experience the world in the middle and at the bottom of society in very much the same way. So, whilst the activist is trying to create ‘awareness’ of ‘injustice’ by being ‘woke’ on behalf of one group or another, what they are really doing is creating division and differentiation.\nFar from tackling ‘structural inequality’ structural inequality is being promoted. This is done by forcing working people to see a world of political or economic disadvantage that is not linked to class but to ‘identity’. Indeed, the white working class is often presented as oppressive to other equally oppressed or marginalised groups. How did we end up with so much confusion?\nMaybe the consciousness of the politician, journalist, mainstream media news anchor, or the artist, actor, or celebrity is defined by their personal status, their elitism, and their lack of equality with the rest of us. It defines their lives and differentiates them from us. They do not have a consciousness that wants to eradicate unfairness, and inequality, they have a consciousness that is guilty about the existence of these things, but they are not capable of recognising in themselves that their privilege contributes to privilege or injustice overall. They blame racism, transphobia, western history, or right-wing governments. They do not recognise that racism, for example, is just one manifestation of the structural disadvantage of which they are themselves, torchbearers.\nThey, the bourgeois elite, are simply the poets and apologists for all so-called oppressed groups. They are not the undertakers of elitism and inequality; they are its most ardent practitioners. They are never going to change class disadvantage because they are the guilty, but willing beneficiaries of it. This is the riddle of history if not solved at least explained. Critical Social Justice Theory and Wokeness is the fog that allows the mechanism for injustice to continue. A mechanism, largely hidden from view by the politics of identity.\nConclusion\nThe revolutionary principles created by capitalism fall into two groups. In the good group are Contract, Choice, and Consent. Of course, it has taken years for many ordinary people to be able to use these principles and in some communities, for example, religious communities, women, and gay people still cannot use them. These principles underpin our freedom and democracy. In the bad corner, we have the leftovers of the feudal system elitism, status, and inequality. These are the bits of the old system that the rich and powerful nineteenth-century and twentieth-century capitalists wanted to keep. It ensured their position and more importantly our position as workers too.\nElitism and unfairness are increasingly unlikely to be promoted among ordinary working people. However, they are all too common among a privileged now largely a Left-Wing class of political activists, politicians and opinion formers who are reluctant to undermine their own class privilege, which is based on maintaining structural political and economic inequality.\nBecause bourgeois systems and structures use the currency of power to impose change and policy from the top, unless these elites are forced by ordinary workers to reform, they will not.\nWithout being forced to change the political or economic system will never get to the point where it realises that elitism, unfairness, and inequality confers no legitimate power and should be replaced by co-operation, collaboration, and consensus. That is, or at least should be a future we should all fight for. That is the riddle of history if not yet fully solved at least explained.\nTo show solidarity with the concept of Blue Revolution and our twenty-first-century reinterpretation of Classical Marxism try and raise your own consciousness above the economic and political world view of your childhood inheritance, what you as you grew up will have been told is ‘just the way it is’.\nThink about whether you really need to work harder just for more money? What is the cost to your lifestyle and your health and wellbeing? Think the importance of status yours and others. How much does your status preoccupy you? Should status or celebrity important? How important should having power be? Could you imagine a world where all people have similar amounts of power? Have you ever knowingly acted unjustly towards someone to get power over them? Did you feel justified doing it? If so why? how much do you genuinely care about other people’s welfare? People, who have deep-seated problems? Is their inequality something to be accepted? Do you think the current political system gives you a real voice? Does the current political system listen? Do you trust the political system? Is it ‘democratic’ If you do, why? These questions can only be answered by you, but your answers will give a clue to the state of your consciousness.\nThink about and talk about consciousness. How we are all, what we think, and how it makes our expectations in life difficult to change. If we see and benefit from elitism, inequality, and unfairness as the political and economic elite do, we will almost certainly find ways of using contract, choice, and consent to preserve them. Until that is the elite find ways of getting us to accept unfairness and inequality using the language of inclusion to impose control, coercion, and compulsion upon the mass of ordinary people.\nExercise\nElitism, unfairness, and inequality is called Structural inequality. How it works and why governments will never ‘level up’.\nA group of twenty people are in a room. They are mixed backgrounds selected randomly. They are all told to mingle and meet people with whom they might have something in common. They are then asked to form four groups of five people and then form four lines of five one line behind the other. Understandably the groups tend to form along sex and racial and other identity lines but not exclusively. Some groups are more mixed than others. Each person is given a piece of paper and is asked to scrunch it up into a ball. A plastic bin is put in front of the first row and they are told that to secure a £10,000 prize thy must get the paper in the bin. If they move away from where they are in the row, before the end of the exercise, they will lose the £10,000 and will have to swap places with someone else. They will also have to throw again from their new position. So, in theory, they could swap with someone at the back. All the front row get the paper in the bin. The whole row collects fifty thousand pounds in total. The next row back are told they have the same opportunity to get the paper in the bin and win the £10,000. The people in row two can see they have to overcome the people already in the front row. Only those in the middle nearest the bin or are tall enough to drop the paper over the heads of those on the front are successful. This row nets £20,000\nThe next group has the same opportunity, to throw the paper ball, and secure a personal reward of £10,000 but again must throw the paper over the heads of the two front groups as well as get it into a bin they cannot see. The front group being guilty but rich to the tune of £10,000 each, try and help by pointing to where the bin is located. They will not move away from the ‘top slot’ themselves. This is a guilty conscience, helping but really achieving nothing.\nThe third group and those at the back fail to get any paper in the bin. Some people at the front say the reason they failed was not that the rows in front did not try and help but because the people at the back were disadvantaged, in some other way. Some people at the back are accused of disadvantaging other people at the back by jostling them etc. One person at the back in a wheelchair is advised that this is the reason that she failed. The rest of her row is blamed by those at the front.\nDo you think it is Ok to have a guilty conscience like the people at the front and talk about helping people at the back with their disadvantage, but being unprepared to do anything meaningful about it because their consciousness simply makes it OK to accept wealth associated with inequality? They accept elitism, inequality, and unfairness because it benefits them personally.\nThis is the difference between a guilty conscience and a raised consciousness. Only the people at the back have the raised consciousness. They can see what is really going on! They have nothing to lose by speaking the truth or sharing what they have. In life in general who would you say is at the back and who at the front? Can you think of other fairer rules for the same game?\nThe Riddle of History Solved- a summary\nHistorical era Consciousness framed b Social outcome\nTribal society coercion, compulsion, and control Collaboration, cooperation, and consensus\nAuthoritarian/Feudalism coercion, compulsion, and control Elitism, inequality, and unfairness\nSingle Party Authoritarian coercion, compulsion, and control Elitism, inequality, and unfairness\nCapitalism contract, choice and consent Elitism, inequality, and unfairness\nPost Capitalism contract, choice and consent Collaboration, cooperation, and consensus\nOr woke intolerance coercion, compulsion, and control Elitism, inequality unfairness\n- Critical Social Justice is a collection of ‘theories’ that promote identity as the only basis for disadvantage. They use the language of Marxism such as consciousness but by focussing on identity fail to either effectively analyse class disadvantage or offer alternatives to political and legal institutions that promote unfair power relationships.

Few responses truly hit the mark that Islam and western values are totally incompatible. But why are they? V2\nA concert aimed at girls and their mums. A singer with an empowering feminist message. This is the reflection of a society that accepts independence and liberation for women as well as men. It is a society that has evolved from the reformation through Protestantism and having had its values seared into its western culture by capitalism and industrialisation now offers the world the free market. The free market is an asset to the world albeit one that is exhausting the planet due to its relentless ‘growth’. It is however at the same time as granting personal freedom the one thing that really seems to infuriate the Islamist to commit acts of unbelievable horror. But why is this?\nThe Islamist has a rigid view of the world, a neurosis almost which in pre-capitalist times would have been a common characteristic among many people of faith. It is prescriptive and determines who has power and authority. In this antiquated system, men have power and authority women less and what power they had, they would exercise through the authority of their husbands. There were set ways to do things and transgression was punished. This is 15th or 16th Century Britain but also Saudi Arabia today and this is the mindset of the modern Islamist terrorist. We have a problem.\nThe whole diversity agenda spoon fed to us by the Blair regime failed to recognise that different cultures and religions view basic differences between people in very different ways and this gives rise to discrimination. In simple Islamic societies rights are accorded on the basis of gender and status and some groups not only have no status but can be put to death for expressing themselves in ways that are prohibited. Freedom of expression, sexual liberation, choice and the right to consent to what happens to you are alien concepts in this kind of faith. They are alien because we enjoy them in the west as a result of our economic and social evolution. Contract, Choice and Consent come with capitalism. You can’t have one without the other. The free market is also based on these freedoms as it has evolved from capitalism in the late 1970’s.\nSo the narrative which we must adopt when dealing with Islamists or indeed anyone who professes a faith is this; “to what extent does your interpretation of your faith reflect the rights of the individual, of any individual (female, homosexual, person of whatever faith) to contract with others freely, to consent to behaviour or refuse to consent, and to choose their own lifestyle as long as it doesn’t affect others”. If you ask anyone of faith this question you would see immediately whether they accept the West’s heritage drawn from its capitalist history or whether they cannot reconcile our freedoms with the demands and rules of their faith. If Trump had asked the Saudis these questions we think he would have been shocked by how few if any “shared values” there are aside from selling arms and buying oil.\nWe don’t need to brag about our free market culture, there are many things that need improving but in giving the world Contract, Choice and Consent capitalism has liberated us all. Perhaps it is our freedom and its link to capitalism that makes the left so squeamish and prone to controlling policies and which finds Corbyn making common cause with those who hate the West. Corbyn needs to understand that capitalism wasn’t just an economic model that exploited workers, it also gave people freedom and a way of life that the Islamists are now trying to destroy.\nIndividual Muslims may have had their own personal reformation but the religion hasn’t and can’t. That bit of history has been and gone leaving its legacy only in the West for us to share with those who will listen.",

We offer a new paradigm.\nThe western world has morphed from a capitalist hegemony into a so-called free market. The transition began after World War two and culminated we believe in the final collapse of capitalism in the 1980’s. The legacy of the West’s capitalist past remains its economic and legal vestiges of contract, choice and consent which whilst granting freedoms also, underpin the growth through debt obsessed ‘free market, the new hegemony of the free world. This debt based free market is the basis for the West’s managed decline. A sad declining world where we are not alienated from our human essence by the capitalist means of production, that went east decades ago, but by our personal obsessions be they consumption, sex or dreams of celebrity. Whilst this is alienation, Marx would have recognised few of the symptoms and none of the cause.\nYoung people on the continent riot with flags that proclaim “we are fucking angry”. But we don’t really understand what they are angry about. They seem troubled by what they call Capitalism but whilst now gone this system gave them the free market, freedom and democracy and the right to be a woman and equal to a man or gay or transgendered and free. Arguably the West’s hegemonic structures such as the IMF, governments and banking system etc ensure that there is a ready supply of largely valueless wealth to slosh around the globe ensuring that the decline of the West will be almost imperceptible to the naked eye so no need to panic and riot.\nThe bankers and the elite will, of course, take a generous slice of this valueless debt based wealth and will ensure their survival in some middle eastern kingdom once the global system finally forecloses on the western world’s largesse. At that point, it will be time to riot but it will be too late all the freedoms the rioting youth currently enjoy will be gone and a morality which is coherent with crisis and shortages and anger will replace them, something like fascism or Sharia perhaps.\nThe rioting youth need to understand that the basic factors that underpin our so called western values are economic not just social of theological. The engine of the economy drives values which over time take on a social character and become’culture’. Once the economic fundamentals are gone, in our case capitalism has gone and the free market is bankrupt and will be going so, the rights and freedoms those systems offer will go too. Unless we seek to understand where they come from and preserve them.\nIt is no good rioting when you have freedom and your belly is full and you are the beneficiary of a system you claim to hate, a system which puts the individual in the west above the rest. Change the system peacefully or as Marx would have said ‘raise your consciousness’ and don’t wait too long to do it. You might end up rioting for your life or find yourself being treated like a woman or man as defined by someone else.\nSo if the Islamic paradigm is twisting in the wind all over the middle east, (except in Saudi where money keeps it going) and the West is facing nemesis for its debt based hubris what will a new paradigm look like. Well, quite simply we should live a life of modesty and self-restraint largely unimpeded by an expensive state or exploitation by one group over another. There must be a recognition nay celebration that in post-capitalist times our capitalist legacy has given us freedoms no other culture has had or currently enjoys to the extent we do, and that to preserve our freedoms we must preserve capitalism’s core values and not out of greed or stupidity seek to destroy them.",

But what is “culture”?\nThe best description of culture and one which gives an unintended nod to our view that economics underpinning it comes from the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain. We were critical of the Liberal Elite and their stupidity in not really understanding why in modern Britain we have people with a temperament and opinions which cut across the freedom and humanity we have created in the west over the last five hundred years but which we are now quickly undermining.\nIn the Parekh report culture is described as “The habits of mind, the intellectual-reflexes and the professional sensibilities which are historically ingrained and typical of the behaviour of a particular group of people…the unconscious understanding and assumptions concerning politics, social life and justice”.\nThis report seems to understand the right things and offered the hope that there would be a greater understanding of why for example anti Semitism exists in the Labour Party or why certain groups take a biblical view of adultery as a “crime”. However, it didn’t deliver what it promised. The reason seems simple to us. Firstly it has no idea where culture comes from. We at Blue Revolution know culture comes from the economic realities of life all over the planet and at various historical periods. And secondly, the report seems to have enshrined within it a belief that moral relativism and liberal bureaucracy are somehow vectors for change amongst various immigrant communities. We have seen that in too many situations this integration just hasn’t happened.\nThe reasons are simple. Traditional values hark back to an area (Pakistan for example)or an era (7th century Arabia) where rigid values around gender etc helped to preserve society. In the modern free market not only is there no need for rigidity around what is acceptable behaviour for men and women and what is not but the free market itself throws up many moral challenges to people of all faiths and many of no faith.\nThe solution to the problem of lack of integration and tolerance of western values is therefore very simple. Accept that western culture is in many ways appalling and also acknowledge why some people of faith harbour intolerant views about the legitimate behaviour of others……and don’t shy away from the debate!",

How does it work?\nWe will develop this later but it is about a few simple things; social and economic value and how it is created, controlled and allocated. It not difficult stoopid!\nThe issues of culture, cultural convergence and cultural relativism have to be understood or debated with common reference points. If not, confusion reigns as arguments are held which have common terms which unfortunately mean different things to different groups or cultures. It is essential that in the twenty-first century and particularly in the post capitalist, western post industrial period we gain some narrative which has a widely agreed objectivity so we can ensure that we don’t sacrifice our hard grafted for western liberty on the gilded altar of a neurotic moral relativism. Because this is going on now, unchallenged and utterly misunderstood. Simply look at the different ways “equality” is used around the world, particularly in relation to women’s rights.\nIf we deal with the world’s non-western cultures, and we won’t specify them but let’s just say they are the ones that discriminate on what we have come to know in the west as “improper” grounds, we find there is a lot of inhumane behaviour much of it state sanctioned, much of it a throw back to the primitivism that it was Capitalism’s destiny to sweep away. We have come to overlook this by adopting the stance of the moral relativist. Adopting this approach FGM is no different to a Boob job or a western contract based marriage no different from polygamy. They are legitimate or illegitimate versions of the same things. When there is a clash, for example, the death penalty for “sorcery” we turn a blind eye…..we have no narrative either to understand this or challenge it so we ignore it and the pathetic plight of those condemned by it.\nThe West has lost its moral leadership cowed by shrill claims of moral imperialism. The reason we have lost our humanitarian voice (except when talking to ourselves) is that we have lost touch with what makes and shapes morality….and that is economics transforming often barbaric holy books. It doesn’t matter whether it is tribal economics or advanced post industrial debt dependent consumer economics, economics shapes our moral parameters.\nBecause most “liberals” don’t understand the role of economics in moral behaviour they can’t create a narrative which helps us understand the traditional culture’s hatred of behaviour like homosexuality nor our western tendency to promote it. We can’t look traditional people in the eye whether here or in their country of origin and ask them whether they understand why they think our culture is immoral, or what it is about our culture they are most appalled by. We just don’t go there perhaps because we can’t face having our nieve belief that everything in the world is fine and “liberal” challenged by the opinions of “disadvantaged” ethnic groups who will shout “post colonial” at us if we challenge their moral perspective.\nThe only way to avoid being accused of racism or equally to avoid turning a blind eye to abuse of minority lifestyles in “traditional” cultures is to have a grounded narrative. A narrative upon which a debate can be found which avoids stereo types, or a mere race and ethnicity based slanging match but which draws out safe debate with people who harbour prejudicial views from whatever cultural origin including western culture. The basis for this narrative has to be economics as this is not only relevant territory for a healthy debate it is safe territory, at least it should be in the 21st century. Later we will examine how this relationship between economics and culture works. As we said above it is about value both social and economic. Is it as Marx suggested the riddle of history solved!\nFor too many decades now the west has failed to grasp that it’s unique offering to the world was its capitalist system. Loved and reviled in equal measure, those who loved it loved the wealth it conferred through its capacity to deliver massive volumes of economic value or profit. Those who hated it hated it because this economic value was created according to the left by “stealing” value from the workers. This “capitalist” system, the ability by risk taking capitalists to mix land, labour and capital to create profit was in terminal decline at the outbreak of WWII and was extinct we believe by the 1980’s.\nCapitalism however shaped the British nation and the British nation shaped the world or much of it. The capitalist system needed and got a legal contractual foundation free of corruption, it required consent and it required the right to make choices. The Corn Laws were and early battle by capitalists against state vested interests as perhaps Brexit for Brexiteers is today.\nthe contract, choice and consent basis that capitalism needed to thrive eventually took on what is called a “social character”. It moved from being merely legal or economic to being the bedrock of what is now the welfare system with its obligation to distribute wealth, as well as becoming the basis of the “free market”.\nEveryone in the west has freedom in enormous quantities, born of a capitalist system generations of westerners have grown up with and fought to preserve. We cannot imagine our freedom being under threat. But it is. It is because to accept it, you have to understand it and its origins in capitalism. Something the “stoopid” European and British “left wing” don’t get.\nIn the UK in Europe, Australia, Canada and America we have brought large numbers of people into our country who have no heritage of choice, consent and contract. When there is no consent in the west a crime is committed but in many cultures that escaped the furnace of 18th to 20th-century capitalism, consent is either a decadent idea or an utter irrelevance. These cultures know where consent is allowed to be practised and where it is not. Like wise with contract and choice. You cannot consent or choose to be Gay for example.\nThe final issue is about value. Before you can stop any culture practising discrimination against minority “lifestyles” that culture needs to produce sufficient “economic value” to survive changes to the way society is organised. A simple, primitive culture, namely one that does not create much economic value (pumping it out of the ground and selling it doesn’t count) will punish those perceived to be undermining the social and economic system. Thus gay people or those women who fail to observe a pre determined social role will be punished.\nWe hope this makes sense and readers can understand that capitalism liberated us and should not be condemned. We also hope the left wing will understand that by continuing their war on capitalism (even though it no longer really exists) they are waging a war on contract, choice and consent and playing into the hands of the primitive cultures for whom our freedoms are a theological and sociological abomination and our moral relativism is our Achilles heel.\nThe final point to ponder is this; we no longer create value in the west either social or economic, we create wealth…money. how long will our culture last therefore irrespective of the forces railed against it?",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_muslim-foster-carers-and-a-christian-child-in-their-care-should-there-really-be-a-story/content_278.html": "Muslim foster carers and a “Christian” child in their care. Should there really be a story?\nNo of course not. In 21st Century Britain there should be no issue with this. Baroness Warsi would make a great foster mum. She is bright ambitious, well connected and we assume able to square the rights of post industrial westerners with her own possible faith based reservations about a range of western identity pre occupations like sexuality or gender reassignment.\nBaroness Warsi, however, was not the foster mum in the recent Uk “Times” story. The foster mum concerned was photographed shrouded in black. The purpose of this traditional dress is that it ensures women observe very strict codes of modesty. This is irrespective of how the woman might feel about this, or indeed how a foster child may view it. The collective pressure of her community and the disapproval of others ensures compliance by te woman concerned.\nNo little girl “Christian” or otherwise should be encouraged to see women as an object of adolescent like male lust. An object that should be shrouded to prevent community disapproval, punishment or in the case of white girls in Rochdale etc the most appalling and degrading abuse.\nAre there any other issues that arise from this sad story about cultural incompatibility? Well yes. Taking a traditional view of a woman’s need for modesty should prompt the local Social Services team to ask further probing questions about the wider rights of women and girls and perhaps how the prospective foster carer views the rights of others like gay people or apostates etc (we should ask similar questions before granting citizenship).\nWe suspect that these questions are not asked. If they were we suspect that too many religiously observant foster carers would be considered highly unsuitable, and that seems to be Ok as long as their faith is Christan or rather non-Muslim. It’s Ok to have a go at Christians or others, they don’t hit back. This illustrates the point we at Blue Revolution make all the time and that is that in the land of the hard left London Boroughs, the general concern for individual rights including rights under the broad banner of “identity politics” can be set aside in deference to the Islamic faith. But why?\nA recent programme on BBC radio 4 covered the subject of Princess Diana. A feminist author took the view that Diana was a practitioner of “victim feminism”. We are not experts on feminism but it sounds like victim feminism is based on the idea that if you claim to be abused, discriminated against and demeaned you have a right to be angry, demand approval, forgiveness, and support, in essence, given “permission” to behave how you like.\nIs this what is happening within our western culture with our reaction to the orthodox observance of Islam? It may be that there are two battles going on against the West by Islamists and Islamophiles. One is fought out in the courts by Islamophile human rights Barristers all claiming special status for Islam as a persecuted and victimised faith. Whilst in Parliament the Civil Service and numerous Council chambers “victim” status is established for Islam scaring social workers, police officers and the like into acquiescence on a range of its cultural peculiarities.\nThe other battle goes on on the streets. On the streets where the cause of Islamophobia has its roots, where Islamism shows its aggressive and murderous side along side it’s general incompatibility with modern values linked to the rights of the individual. There is little if any Contract, Choice, and Consent in orthodox Islam and you can’t expect there to be. These are western notions forged in the white heat of capitalism and industrialization, which are alien to cultural Islam.\nThe lessons from this sorry tale of the little foster child are that whilst we should not in post industrial 21st century Britain be worried about anyone being fostered by anyone of faith, unfortunately, we have to be when that faith is orthodox observant Islam. Practitioners of orthodox Islam in almost all cases will hold beliefs that contradict a whole range of individual rights identity rights, and modern values. Beliefs that certainly won’t be compatible with the Human Rights Act such as the basic right of gay men to have a life or a woman to be sexually liberated from control by her “guardian” male.\nWith the skillful application of victim status by Human Rights Barristers within the British legal system and with a left wing Islamophle local government bureaucracy more than happy to champion these “faith victims” above all others, the dialogue with practitioners of orthodox Islam is silenced. We need a grown up conversation, not about Islam but about the values people bring to roles like fostering. The lack of this dialogue is what fuels Islamophobia. Shame on the establishment for letting the people down again!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_what-do-you-call-it-when-the-taxpayer-subsidizes-production-from-land/content_284.html": "What do you call it when the taxpayer subsidizes production from land…………..?\nWell it’s not feudalism? What do you call it when the ordinary tax-payer subsidizes labour? well it isn’t socialism? So what is it called when the ordinary taxpayer subsidizes capital? Well its not capitalism and it is probably the biggest rip off in world history. The land, the poor and the planet, are having to pay the price!! We need a planet saving, freedom promoting and capital preserving Blue Revolution!\nThis issue of the relationship between society and its means of production is elemental to our understanding how and why the world is as it is today and the likely success of the competing ideologies that are starting to wrestle for influence or supremacy in a world made fluid by the end, through bankruptcy, of the anglo/US two hundred year old trading hegemony.\nHow does it work? Well Feudalism is the theft of land value by an elite. The system has some legitimacy because only the elite are capable of maintaining order and thus making this economic model work. However once the land is subsidised by government it marks the end of land related authority. Should the land be subsidized? probably not! But neither should it simply be monetised by house building. This turns land value into cash for the few and not for the pleasure of the many.\nBeyond land based economic models we move to Capitalism and its massive productive output. Workers paid wages to enable them to create economic value for the capitalists. The Capitalists have supremacy. The State and the wage bill is paid by them but they still get a good return and political power. Socialism by contrast takes much of the Capitalists value and turns it into state expenditure. Subsidizing labour to the tune of health, welfare and pensions expenditure. Note it is the Capitalist who is paying the bill for welfare on the whole, either directly or via the taxation levied on their workers.\nFinally the end of this civilised model comes when capitalism can’t support the state or the States “socialist” aspirations and also can’t support itself as an economic system (i930’s then 1980’s and 2007/8 and finally 20??). At that point the Capitalist system is essentially dead and needs putting down but that could lead to social chaos. So the elite seizing an opportunity to make money put it on life support. That life support is a regime of taxpayer funded government and personal debt. The capitalist system is now no more than a valueless free market lantern show of of some of capitalism’s past glories such as “profit”. “Profit” is used to justify wealth for those who consider their wealth to be “legitimately” earned. There is no “legitimate” wealth in this system as the system produces no real value based wealth just debt.\nThe problem as we at Blue Revolution continually argue, is that the values (contract, choice and consent) that two hundred years ago transformed feudalism into capitalism and the values that transformed capitalism into socialism in Britain (health, and welfare), will likely disappear when the final embers of the unsustainable free market go cold. Then what?",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_how-moral-is-the-free-market-when-you-are-an-economic-determinist/content_367.html": "How moral is the “free market” when you are apply principles of material determinism?\nWe have tended to spend a lot of time thinking about the left, in particular, their denial of the origins of our rights in the capitalist system and their failure to grasp the importance of “surplus value” as opposed to debt in any kind of “just” society. However, their critique of the “free market” whilst well intended, has clearly failed to “hit the right spot” at least as far as we are concerned. How so?\nAlmost total economic reliance on the free market and the financial sector arose in the 1980’s, promoted by neocons like Blair and Clinton. They advanced a range of policies intended to stimulate consumption and therefore create economic growth.\nThe Western free market became more and more debt-dependent. What beguiles us is that whilst the free market has a lot of capitalisms DNA primarily values of contract, choice and consent which underpin our precious freedoms and liberty, it creates only fictitious wealth. Unlike real “surplus value” generated by capitalism, the free market relies on global labour market differentials and the financial engineering of debt to make a small elite very rich. It also keeps too many people in the West very poor.\nIt took us at BlueRevolution a while to “click” that the phrase used in the 1980’s to describe post-industrial economics, “a greater role for financial services” basically involved governments and people getting into more and more debt to pay for their and their nation’s consumption. Much of what is being consumed however is made on the far side of the planet so the act of “production” is removed from what should be an economic synthesis of production and consumption. A balancing act of land, labour and capital generating value to be acquired either by capitalists, workers or the State.\nWhat does this mean for morality? Well, it would lead us to conclude that a number of social difficulties arise from this new “free market” model. Firstly to maintain consumption but without production, the economy has to have money fed into it. This is where debt comes in. Italy has debt equal to 135% of GDP. The UK is less but only because of the willingness of its working people to get into debt themselves.\nBecause we are economic determinists we believe our lifestyles and our morality will become shaped by our material circumstances which are basically indebtedness. One obvious consequence is that we can consume more than is sustainable for the planet to produce, as we can defer payment until a tomorrow that never arrives. Global warming may or may not be man-made but pollution certainly is!\nAfter massive overproduction, the next most significant consequences of the free market model is that wage levels are fixed globally so work goes to the cheapest labour. The mix of land, labour and capital happens in China or Vietnam or elsewhere. This has resulted in a new class developing, not of revolutionary organised proletarians ready to seize control of the “capital” they produce, but a sad welfare and “healthcare” dependent class. This “class” is reliant not on worker produced capital or wages, but government debt for their miserable survival. For this group of second and third generation, ex-industrial workers (millions across US, EU and UK) choices in life are determined not by personal economic realities but welfare entitlements. The big pharma industries are always on hand to stimulate or lobotomise as required.\nThis is the constituency that is simply awaiting an ideology that makes sense to their hopeless existence and that could be Islamism or ideas from the far right. Certainly, in continental Europe the “free market” is both attracting migrants and then inflicting on them a living hell of welfare and idleness so they are at risk of becoming radicalised in ghettos.\nThe “liberal left” pretend to understand immigration, however, immigration needs a functioning economic system to proletarianise newly arrived people and turn them into workers with modern tolerant liberal values.\nThese values are based on capitalisms principles of contract choice and consent. The free market too often fails to find an economic role for these migrants. In the West promoting these values within an inclusive economy that demands their application as opposed to mere appreciation is how we should preserve our rights and freedoms and inculcate them into those for whom such principles seem alien. Particularly when women’s rights are considered.\nFinally, after debt funded overproduction and its contribution to planetary destruction as well as the inability to engage all in society in meaningful economic activity, we have the morality of we consumers ourselves.\nAn economic choice is an important principle, who you work for and for how much is the way we identify worker from slave or surf. However today we have too many consumer choices which with their basis in debt aren’t realistic choices at all. Moreover, too much choice which comes too easily breeds a sense of entitlement that is dangerous when governments try to reign in public spending and thus limit choice. Our binary political system fails because consumers with a vote tend to want more not less hence spiralling national debt. Political parties are no longer able to represent the nation responsibly. People in politics and less party is required.\nAs the western free market lacks mass collective production people identify themselves as consumers and individuals, sort of unique units of consumption. This we believe explains the death of the “class system” in the Uk. As production is no longer a collective activity but a best an individual one individuals market just about anything they can. This is the West’s Achilles heel. For in the West we can now find a provider for just about any form of behaviour or product we might want to experience. “Industries” are created such as the pornography industry which takes a private non-commercial activity and sells it as a product to be consumed. Eventually, this goes mainstream and erodes our sense of interpersonal morality. It affects how we relate to each other too, we are consumed or the consumer of each other. Divorce perhaps reflects this sad reality.\nSome “of faith” view this development as symptomatic of an increasing moral sickness and a sense emerges that our freedoms are to blame. The free market separates our behaviour from any sense of it being wrong, as long as what is produced and consumed has a price within the economy. A lot of groups and ideologies find this is justification enough to try and change our freedom loving way of life.\nSo, in conclusion, we have a free market loosely based on the values of capitalism but without capitalisms discipline and capacity to combine land, labour and capital to create value. The free market produces vast amounts of stuff for people to consume gobbling up resources and polluting the planet. People get rich within this model whilst others see their jobs go abroad and in the worst cases end up existing on welfare and drugged up in healthcare. The debt dependent workers pay for it!\nWe need to re-engineer our politics to reflect these economic realities making it more democratic and inclusive, to liberate people from what is becoming an increasingly dangerous and planet destroying economic political and social model.",

Both managed to attract voters back from smaller parties and maintain the political hegemony. It was like the Heath and Wilson years. Labour with a more appealing cream tea as opposed to the Conservatives threats of Marxism today under Labour. Labour clearly got the youth vote and the vote of those who have been getting the brunt of the Tories ‘austerity’ measures. Austerity it really wasn’t it just didn’t feel very generous and so fed into Labour’s instinct for manufacturing class war even when the only real classes there are these days are the working class and those on welfare.\nSo we have a depleted Tory party in the HoC and a resurgent Labour party. However, from the perspective of a Blue Revolution, it is all just another attempt to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic rather than spot the financial iceberg and steer the ship away from it. The main parties can only offer palliative care to the British economy and society because A) they don’t trust the public to assist them with the task of sorting the problems out and B) the institutions of the state which make so many people very rich will resist reform at all costs. For example, why should we pay for a refurb of Parliament? Turn it into a museum and open a new ‘virtual’ parliament in Milton Keynes based on our legislative college (see manifesto). In a globalised labour market that is exactly what a private company would do. It is what parliamentarians have allowed to happen to our industry and in doing so have created the second and third generation ex-industrial unemployed or as too many of them call them, the underclass.

It is as with Ukip often quite capable of shifting back too. Hence the current shift back to the 1970’s with both Labour and Conservatives. The 1970’s provides two well known although out of date operating model for both parties which somehow feels wrong to us in the 21st Century.\nWhat is interesting about the Labour approach to economics is how it mirrors the authoritarianism of what one might call capitalism at its worst. With capitalism at its worst, we had the man with the stove pipe hat ordering exploited workers about and then taking the proceeds of their labour as his profit. The reason socialists deride ‘capital’ is that it is the store of value which rightly belongs to the workers but has been appropriated by the capitalist. The structures within which the appropriation takes place are hierarchical, authoritarian and deny the worker a sense of owning the processes of their labour. They are alienated from the production process and therefore alienated from the economy. They, the workers, exist in an economy over which they have no control.\nWhat Corbyn and the Labour party want to do is replace what they believe to be a system which is like this system, with their socialist New Jerusalem. Jeremy Corbyn, Seamus Milne and John McDonnell at the head of a system that takes tax off people and which pays for services and industry. The means by which they will do this are unfortunately hierarchical, authoritarian and deny the worker a sense of owning the processes of their labour as even the poor have to pay tax for this expensive system and will operate in a hierarchy over which they have no control. The reason why the Socialist New Jerusalem is like this is that it takes its inspiration from the old capitalist system it is so quick to condemn. However where the capitalist system has risk and failure built in so that there is a churn in the market generating lower costs to consumers and improved services, in the left’s New Jerusalem the state halts all of this. It takes on ownership of the means of production and the delivery of services but with no functioning market, the whole system becomes atrophied. What also does not change is the hierarchy which has serried ranks of officials and politicians paying themselves tax payers money so they can enhance their personal wealth, payment to them for running the state and its industries. Unfortunately, this mirrors the exploitation of the worker under capitalism.\nThe bad news for Britain is that the progressive parties are far from progressive and the Conservatives whilst not wanting to re-implement this taxpayer exploiting model don’t do anything to reduce the people’s tax burden. No wonder we feel alienated, frustrated and ill. No one is arguing for us they are all in various ways looking out for themselves, most notably the progressives of the left.",

Not much justice in that. V3\nThe England football team; millionaires to a man, the luvvies who cried buckets over Brexit and who are also millionaires and Sir Philip Green another millionaire have one striking characteristic in common; they owe their wealth to other peoples debt. The mechanism is straight forward enough. In the west we don’t produce enough actual value to support ourselves, so we have to borrow. This maintains what “Keynsians” refer to as “aggregate demand”. Aggregate demand in a closed market system should be value based and would generate jobs and production which should kick-start economic recovery.\nHowever in an economic system such as there is in the west where there are “impediments” to the functioning of this type of market strategy for growth namely, profit by outsourcing production to China, little by way of savings and huge corporations and collusive governments, aggregate demand is maintained via debt. As a result there are routes through which certain groups can prosper and who can turn the low income and indebtedness of others into huge wealth for themselves. This money flows to luvvies and footballers and retailers who fail to grasp the basic injustice that their bounteous wealth is due to ordinary people either taking out debt or via taxes helping to pay government debt.\nIf a just system was applied, then people would not be in debt but would take the modest amount of surplus value at their disposal (in classical terms this is called “wages”) and they would allocate it to football or entertainment (or both). A properly functioning market would ensure that the footballer or luvvie was never able to acquire huge wealth as competition would preclude this. In the west however we have the TV companies, football Premier Leagues and Corporations who game the system and facilitate the elevation of certain individuals, applying to them a price which is excessive and requires money to be extracted in larger and larger amounts from poorer and poorer people. This might be justified on the basis of protecting the brand.\nThe debtmeisters of the banking system also feed this debt monster so they to can “profit” from this valueless wealth too. The need for the economic system to maintain “aggregate demand” forces more and more people into debt, including governments. It also crystallises inequality and disadvantage. It makes too many frivolous people very wealthy and either like luvvies very sanctimonious or footballers very rich and gaudy. The luvvies complain about a system that they simultaneously love to hate but which puts vast amounts of valueless wealth into their too often over stuffed pockets. The footballers don’t pretend to understand the process but enjoy the fruits of this market malfunctioning. Who can blame them!!\nWe at a Blue Revolution don’t do “Red” revolutions, namely building up the size of the state to enable it to take money off people only to give it back to other people. We believe in making the market work haed to avoid the excessive build up of debt based wealth by people who’s wealth is well above their ability to create value. To put this right “aggregate demand” has to be re evaluated in importance and we have to accept economic shrinkage before creating real economic growth. We also have to look at “market function” and re engineer it so it does not create these “one person monopolies”.\n03.07.16 The fear of poverty drives our opposition to austerity. However the poverty we have in the west is moral not financial. Are these in any way connected?\nIn simple terms the answer to this question is yes of course moral contexts drive economic levers. In a pre agricultural tribal society certain actions were taken to prevent “immoral” behaviour, genital mutilation, tribal “rights” etc. As we progressed as a species we began to loosen the preventative practices and to exact punishments instead. The amount of value mankind was capable of crating in post agricultural tribes suggested that some amount of freedom was possible but transgression was dealt with swiftly. In some “modern” economies there is still some element of this moral or existential neurosis which is reflected in death penalties, amputations and torture. The US attitude to guns and punishment is very “fearful frontier-man” a form of tribalism. Saudi Arabia……enough said.\nIn the west a form of market based morality has emerged; anything you want as long as you pay for it! Due to the intersession of the state the elements of this immorality which within a tribal society would have threatened the very existence of the tribe are not only mitigated by government policy but become positively rewarded. The problem is that the challenges that would have emerged in a tribal society such as adultery, illegitimate births, one person acquiring too much value (theft then just reward now!) and which would have resulted in swift death or exclusion have no consequences now; but the long terms effects are just as existential. If anything this is another good reason to exit the EU as its long term moral course is definitely exaggerating inequality and promoting immorality on a continental scale. All of this is promoted by technocrats, bureaucrats and the anxious Remainers as “progressive” which of course it is not.\nThe immorality that infects the west spawns a loathing for the mechanisms of the state and society that creates or is seen to create the immorality. Particularly problematic if you are a North African migrant living in a Paris ghetto and observing the “culture” around you from your vantage point of welfare subsidized rage. Fathers alone and childless, mothers who’s children are reared by “strangers”; the unspoken abuse inherent within such arrangements, the loss of grandparents as feuding goes on and on, loneliness, and substance abuse. Welfare babies on an industrial scale. We turn away from confronting this moral poverty at our long term cost.\nThe need for the west to deal with this moral reality “humanely” seems to us to be the cause of the anti austerity sentiments and the movement that promotes it. Anti austerity is not exactly pro moral poverty; however it won’t be possible to deal with moral poverty unless we reframe the argument in favour of austerity and moral renewal.\nNow who has the confidence to go there?\nNB we do not include homosexual relationships or transgender issues in our moral critique. In modern societies as opposed to tribal ones, all individuals have to make economically sustainable moral choices and sexuality has no relevance. This contrasts with having casual welfare babies and being economically encouraged to do so.\n04.07.16 Global trade is stagnant and the EU is part of the problem. There is untapped value out there in places like Africa and free trade will unlock it\nBritain is the most networked country on the planet. The views of experts from the EU and other places like the US about Brexit only served to make us at a Blue Revolution feel that Britain needed to be put in its place by a bolshie global elite. Not for them the liberating effects of free trade but the continuation of established arrangements that promoted the big bureaucrats and the big businesses. This is yesterdays economic model. The future belongs to the quick witted and the enterprising not to those who desire a “rigged” operating environment which favours the cautious over the brave. If the world our children and grandchildren live in is to preserve peace and to respect the rights of others then we have to send trade into places currently wrecked by war. The development of trade relationships which are as far as possible symmetrical but complex as opposed to one sided and simplistic (selling arms for example to oil rich despots) should unleash the productive capacity of nations currently viewed as “failed”.\nThe wests past “progressive” march to war is a failed methodology for dealing with hard to reach and influence places; trade should be, as it always has been, viewed as a proxy for war and the United Kingdom is better places than most to lead the world in a revival of trade and real growth based on Contract, Choice and Consent. With this as Britains post Brexit strategic plan not only will Britain benefit but so will the rest of the world and unlike the anxious attached of the “Remain” camp our children and children’s children will be safer and freer to be who they want to be in a newly un-trading world which is currently hostile to them, us, and all that isn’t “traditional” as defined by the late 7th century.\n06.07.16 Britain’s Labour Party; can a Blue Revolution assist the non reds inside Jeremy’s bed?\nThe guys and Gals at a Blue Revolution can’t help but smile at the mess the British Labour party is in. Whilst the Blue in Blue Revolution has little to do with the Conservative Party the contrast between the Conservative Party and Labour Party is stark. The Conservatives have straight forward, empathetic and humane politicians from different racial backgrounds, most “progressive” and articulate (one or two exceptions noted however) and they are about to elect their second female leader. Then their is the Labour Party with its shameful need for an enquiry into anti-Semitism, its treatment of Muslim women and its incoherent ideology of anti this whilst being pro that. With its internal squabbles Labour is an object lesson in how not to seek power and present as competent to lead. And of course there is Tony Blair and whatever shakes out of Chilcot today. Old Labour, New Labour, hard to decide which is worse.\nSo what advice would we at a Blue Revolution give to the more sane and rational presumably “New Labour” types in the Corbyn party? Well there are some options: stay put and hope the left and Momentum loose their, well, momentum. Secondly decamp from the “Corbyn Party” and start a “New Labour” Party. The problem with this approach is that it certain that many such MP’s will loose out to hard left candidates at the next General Election in 2020. Another approach could be to decamp to another party before they start to identify their own candidates for 2020. The issue here is that the success of this strategy will depend on who was the runner up in 2015. If a moderate Labour candidate won against a Lib Dem or a Tory it may be possible to hold the seat if standing next time as a Lib Dem or a Tory.\nHowever given the complexity of British politics and the complex political landscape it will probably be the case that the latter two options will be right for some Labour MP’s and simply hanging in to be de selected will be right for the others, whilst hoping the momentum of Momentum declines.\n06.07.16 After Chilcot: Why not crowd fund a case of non targeted misfeasance in a public office against Blair. Or has the time it has taken to publish the report rendered action “out of time”. V2\nWell why not have a look into it. A war criminal he may not strictly speaking be, but a misfeasor he might just be. And he has the wealth to enable him to pay damages to those for whom his war has caused the greatest financial and emotional damage. The Chilcot decision swerves the necessary criticism which may turbo charge a allegation such as a claim of Blair ill motivation or lying. However he was reckless, exaggerated the case for war and had an obvious awareness of the weakness of the case advanced for embarking on war. These issues are the meat and drink of non targeted misfeasance. Once the lawyers for the families have picked over Chilcot it will be interesting to see if they agree with us.\n09.07.16 The post Brexit landscape cries out for a Capability Brown but how revolutionary dare they be?\nWe have explored the issue of the long term decline of the west caused by “secular westernism” and the culture of confidence based “free market” economics managed through a Bureaucratic system of government manipulation that has as its aim and intent maintaining “aggregate demand”. Aggregate demand is the blood that runs through the veins of the modern “free market” and along with the commodification of everything gives secular westernism its unique if alienating immoral culture. Western Christian values don’t really get a look in when every one wants to be a Rock (or porn) star.\nBrexit gives the UK an opportunity to help kick start the world economy and get the meta values of Contract Choice and Consent embedded in the world beyond the West. However some of the post election Brexiteers seem to have adopted a position of viewing post Brexit as an opportunity to spend money saved from Europe on their pet projects within the UK and this of course involves welfare. However it is welfare that needs drastic reform and whilst this cannot in the name of humanity involve overnight change there has to be a shift back towards giving Britain’s adults the right to make decisions and to take responsibility for adult activity like reproduction and health. This has to involve decisions like how fat to get and how many children to have. These two totemic issues sum up more than any other the problem faced by a government with a Bexit windfall.\nAny money saved from renegotiation cannot be wasted on the economically unproductive and their numerous welfare offspring. Welfare has infantilised too many people and continues to do so. The dysfunctional cycle of prison, welfare, babies, next lot of prison has to be broken and broken humanely. But broken it must be. Like wise the instinct to set wage levels at a level higher than is currently the case needs to be reviewed. Minimum wages and welfare policy create the context for irresponsible behaviour. Wage levels for the poorest in the UK should increase simply by limiting welfare for migrants and preventing the flow of too many unskilled workers. There doesn’t have to be a minimum wage level in the long term if the labour market is re engineered properly. This was a Blair idea to ensure that with mass EU migration wage levels didn’t hit the floor. Which without a statutory minimum they would have done.\nWage levels like much else should ideally be set by the market and not government. Wage levels should enable an individual to pay for a roof over their head, put food on the table and allow some recreation and consideration of whether the personal economic forecast would suggest children should be brought into the world. The ability to make informed decisions in respect of marriage and children is something that needs to repatriated to Britain’s adult population. Currently the decision doesn’t have to be made, as welfare and the minimum wage effectively take choice away. Hence our high divorce rate and number of “single parent” households living not on wages but benefits.\nSo our Blue Revolution “Capability Brown” should start by replanting the post war bedding plants some strong perennials that can at minimal cost to the taxpayer grow strong and survive in the new competitive global context. We don’t expect people in the rest of the world to be as morally undermined as we have become in respect of health and fertility here in the west. Their competitive edge is born by hard work and sound moral choices with low levels of government subsidy for politically expensive but socially undesirable behaviour. We quite rightly have to compete in a world where our “soft landing social context” is the biggest cost to government and therefore to our competitiveness in world markets. The adults out there will not fear this future but the other half of the country probably will.\n13.07.16 Theresa May promises a bit of a Blue Revolution. But how far will she go to re engineer the society and economy left by Blair and co?\nTony and Gordon handed on a wonky bit of economic engineering to Dave and George. We all know it as the British economy. To the casual observer it looks like it works. Money seems to come in and money seems to go out, stuff gets done. It has a deficit which the government is dealing with, whilst the newly “confident” consumer picks up the slack and keeps aggregate demand at a level that appears to keep the wheels on the economic bus. Government seems to be doing Ok so people start to borrow.\nThere is one very important factor about modern Britain however. It is debt dependent. This debt based economic model was gifted to the 2010 – 2015 coalition government by Labour and was in effect a Blair/Brown model for taking peoples debt and turning it into personal wealth for a bunch of rich cronies of whom New Labour were notoriously “casual”.\nThis is the stinking core of the Blair model and it can be seen in all its naked glory as the “Blair rich project” trundles along as Blair himself mews platitudes of self justification about his role in destroying Iraq and the lives of British servicemen and women and their families.\nThe legacy of Blair in the UK is nowhere near on par with what he has done elsewhere in the world. However the damage is noteworthy. Open boarders and a tax credit system that turbo charged migration, a welfare and economic system that promotes personal”wealth” at the expense of “social value”; generating entitlement. This economic model has created three “classes” of people all of whom Mrs May should identify and begin slowly to diminish in size. The US has a similar classes but different solutions would be needed.\nFirstly the “debt masters” or “plastic capitalists” who like the ghastly Lord Peter M of New Labour fame seek out wealth and the wealthy, acquiring wealth which in a debt model is always at someone else’s expense, a process we call debtamorphosis. There are many problems with this because essentially the model depends on debt, mass migration, escalating stock and house prices, welfare and a tolerance for general moral decline.\nThe government provide wealth to the poor in the form of benefits, and the poor buy over priced cheaply manufactured rubbish and in doing so the government’s debt quickly acquires the status of wealth for the “plastic capitalists” (Sir Phil Green anyone). It also provides tax revenue for the government.\nAs we have said before many very wealthy people succumb to the belief their wealth is value based rather than debt based. In doing so they are simply in denial. However the role of a Government with Blue Revolutionary credentials is to raise the public’s consciousness about this. The real Capitalist created value and then nicked it off the worker. The plastic capitalist simply takes other people debt as their income via consumer spending. Arguably an even more immoral system.\nSir Phillip Green is a millionaire because he could work the market to get other people to borrow so he could become rich. Boardrooms with employees on the Board might help control “Fat Cats” like Green but overturning the structures and expectations that require debt to contribute to aggregate demand has to be a twenty year government project.\nIn doing this the economy will appear to shrink but it is a necessary shrinkage. Necessary before we start to grow economic value and not simply personal wealth. The army of plastic “Capitalists” who without real capital, use the free market to extract peoples debt for personal gain has to be tackled. Mrs May needs to recognise these so called “fat cats” for what they are; parasites on the poor.\nAfter debt dependent “Fat Cats” come the legion of public sector “Fat Cats”. The “Publicsectocracy” as we call them are one of two “synthetic” engineered classes (the other being the underclass). Basically “synthetic” classes are those which have no actual link to the working of the REAL economy. They are engineered simply by government spending recklessly.\nThe economy creates government money via taxation, this money is augmented by debt and this is paid to Public sector “fat cats” (those on 100K +) in the form of wages. The creation of public sector fat cats comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about who controls the fruits of the real economy; such as those fruits are these days.\nThe Publicsectocracy sees the fruits of the economy and the debt created by government as theirs to spend on themselves whilst trying to achieve socially desirable outcomes. The reason that most public sector “fat cats” don’t reform the top end of the public sector is simple; why should they. A Chief Constable in every county! now with a Police and Crime Commissioner in every county just adds up to needless cost to the taxpayer but a great income for those in these posts. This is replicated in every Government and Local Government office throughout the public sector. How do we pay for them all?\nMrs May needs to recognise the self promoting power of the publicsectocracy. Change needs to come in both scale and salary of those at the top. No one public sector worker should earn more than the Prime Minister. We call the process of culling these top wages “rescaling” the Public Sector. Here is a paradox…in every department of the public sector social value is contributed be it policing, providing housing, working with prisoners, or abused children or maintaining a local park. The maximum social value is added at the bottom of the organisation but as the “value added” goes down (as one goes up the hierarchy) wages go up. The top executives are essentially over paid figureheads who are paid to take a responsibility for delivery of a service they can’t and don’t have the skills to deliver themselves. The publicsectocracy needs to be brought to heel and that includes the top lawyers, Judges and medics. Let them go abroad if they want to!\nFinally the most ulnerable group who need massive reform. They are are again “synthetic” in that this class, like the publicsectocracy, is created not by the economy but by government policy. They are the underclass. This class of the unemployable, the misfits, the intemperate, and stupid add so little to the positive experience of daily life as to be seen as a burden on society by everyone except the hard left who with characteristic ignorance confuse them with the “working class”. The underclass are interesting as a “synthetic” class (much more interesting than the “publicsectocracy” as they don’t even maintain the pretence of wanting to add social or even economic value to society. Karl Marx would have found this class baffling, living on the value created by others, like an aristocracy but ignorant and uncouth.\nNow it is important to be clear the underclass or not the unemployed or disabled. The disabled and unemployed however may have members of the underclass within their ranks. The underclass like all proper classes have a set of values which define them. In the case of the underclass it is idleness, ignorance and a propensity to artificially move up Maslow’s hierarchy at someone else’s expense. This is the class that spawns the Jihadi both here and on the continent. This is the class that has welfare babies creating women who are not workers but wards of the state. These people reproduce but produce no value either social or economic.\nSocial value is the key to the future. If Mrs May can get the “publicsectocracy” on the back foot then more socially useful work can be transferred to the community. Unemployed people can make a positive social contribution by caring for others and promoting positive social health. Proper communities bringing kids up properly and looking after their old and infirm. In doing this the two synthetic classes will be put under existential threat and in 100 years from now that will be a cause of great celebration. Trust us!!\n19.07.16 America and its “gun culture”. Can we at a Blue Revolution offer some advice?\nAmerica. A strange yet familiar culture to those of us in the Anglo sphere. Strange even to many Americans. Until a few years ago it electrocuted its murderers, mainly black. America drove infeasibly naff cars, to feed its working classes, again mainly black, it created a working class diet based on corn syrup and fat. It spent its government money not on welfare but on arms and warfare. It created the post capitalist “free market” which, with bankers and assorted hangers on, turned an economic system based on value to one based on wealth; and wealth flows so easily to the unscrupulous, whereas value is so much more difficult to create.\nAmerica had its origins in a combination of Puritanism and survivalism. An odd combination given that Puritanism is inherently conservative and survival depends on a ruthless pragmatism. The Puritanism defined the economic culture. The ruthless pragmatism would have been applied on a continental scale to preserve the Puritanism. Hence Article two “the right to bear arms”. Every man, and we are sure many women, were part of a culturally homogeneous militia albeit one that was not racially equal.\nIf we look at what differentiates the UK from the US, it is that the UK’s existential crisis spanned hundreds of years, hundreds of years ago. Also the UK had a feudal system which was based on “natural authority” which prevented “Citizen militias”.\nThe industrial scale manufacture of weapons came at a time when the UK population had little need to protect its culture and land mass; it was safe and well embedded. However mass production of weapons occurred at a time when America did need to protect its self and its culture and every man was therefore part of a grand militia with a right to bear arms. All within a nascent democracy giving further legitimacy to mass gun ownership.\nThe need to widely disseminate arms was paramount in the USA’s past. The need to preserve culture and protect land from an existential threat has however diminished over time. The US is unassailable to external force now. The risk comes not from without but from within. The culture of freely available arms, and the urge to protect this culture has unsurprisingly in the absence of a shared set of universal values become degraded to the point where every lifestyle difference of approach can be categorised in the minds of too many as an existential threat. Not an existential threat to the nation but to the individual….unfortunately in too many cases the armed individual.\nThe secular western culture of “we make it up as you go along” has stripped America of its shared values and widely available guns have made the streets essentially a cultural and economic battleground. Within this context the government too is seen as an existential threat to too many Americans. As a result they are shooting each other. And worse the police have become identified with the “state” shooting the nations black minorities. The whole thing is likely to go up in flames.\nSo the advice. The NRA are seriously misguided if they think that American gun ownership is protecting a shared Anglo Saxon Culture. Gun ownership isn’t protecting anything and never will again. The NRA needs to stop promoting gun ownership as though there was still something universal to protect by some kind of culturally and racially homogenous militia.\nThe State and particularly the Federal Government is no more or less legitimate to many Americans than their own cultural opinions or preferences be they racial religious or secular. So the state should stop arming those who deal with the public as though the armed public servant is protecting a vulnerable political system. Arms should be removed from public display by public officers. The public and the Government should perceive themselves as having equal power, as in a democracy they should have.\nFinally the possession of weapons should be seen as a public health issue and those who feel the need to arm themselves for reasons other than Sport or agriculture should be seen as people who have a vulnerability that cannot and should not be compensated for by firepower.\n19.07.16 Clinton and Trump. On the face of it both very different, but in reality Trump is only different because he is a big mouth\nI think someone has written about the western economic paradigm on the a Blue Revolution website a little while ago. The theme was that nothing will change much in the secular western world because western politicians are enthralled by the need to create “wealth” by all and any means possible. All this whilst ignoring difficult places where there is untapped value, mainly dangerous countries with underdeveloped social and political systems.\nThe secular western world has become dependent on wealth as opposed to value creation at every social level. Whether the worker is public sector or working in the private sector, having high personal aggregate demand is essential to maintain lifestyles of choice. The government fearful of loosing votes indulges the public’s appetite for money and uses the upward volatility of property and stock values to generate debt based wealth. This is combined with government borrowing and welfare spending keeps the economic show on the road.\nIn the U.S. it is little different but not significantly so. Clinton is a government debt master or mistress; someone who is prepared to borrow and spend to maintain aggregate demand in the misguided belief that this is good for the economy. This policy can be toyed with because interest rates are low….too low to worry about. Likewise people borrow too and pump this leveraged liquidity into the consumer economy. The debt masters in the U.K. stretch back to Brown and Blair and their heirs apparent Cameron and the financial wizard Osborn. This secular western paradigm is dangerous in the long term. But Trump is different right?\nWell Trump talks about “The American Dream”. The American dream was essentially Christian culture using the transformative power of Capitalism to drive out, through sheer productive capacity, the benign tribalism of the indigenous Indians. The “American dream” was a phase of history that took under productive land and people a created a dynamic culture based on Contract, Choice and Consent.\nTrump talks about this “dream”but has little idea of what underpins it and therefore out of ignorance transforms what he believes it is, ie making money, into a showy form of prejudice against “non Americans”. To a pouting infant like Trump the American dream is simply being proud of America and being cash rich. The American’s lap it up and who can blame them. However Trump is a property man. A Debt Master himself. Property is the engine of the debt based western economy. So whilst Trump talks up America, his economic model (if indeed he can actually articulate such a thing) is simply to use higher property and stock values to leverage debt into the consumer economy. Osborne did it in the UK. The formula is simple. Talk up the economy to create “consumer confidence” sit back and wait for the personal leveraging to start and then add government borrowing too. The house price and stock inflation keeps the illusion going that there are reasons to be confident.\nIn the UK Osborn’s case his total hysteria about Brexit highlighted just how dependent his model was on confidence based debt. Trump will adopt the same strategy; because he has no idea what he is doing. With Clinton you will get a considered policy of government borrowing and spending on welfare or “investment” with the cost borne by the poor taxpayer and the consequence a bigger state. With Trump the newly confident poor will borrow their own money for their own spending as Trump and his consumer “free marketers” laugh all the way to the bank.\nWhat unites these two “Presidential” candidates is their morally bankrupt and socially corrosive debt based economic model. What makes them different is Trump has a big mouth.\n19.07.16 When will the liberal elite, particularly the left wing liberal elite, realise that “Education, Education,Education” won’t tackle Islam’s core values…….. and why should it. V2\nThere is something very frustrating about listening to the left wing trying to square the many circles that the real world throws up when the real world contrasts itself with the limitless naivety of their social hand wringing and economically illiterate perspectives. They don’t get confused themselves of course, they can mouth political platitudes like seasoned pro’s. They just confuse, frustrate and bore everyone else. Nothing illustrates their brain exploding confusion more than the interface between their liberal views and their promotion of minority values…..all minority views even regressive ones, particularly if the view can be linked to an anti capitalist ideology such as Islamism.\nWhether the “left winger” or as Marx would have called them “vulgar socialists” are hard left or from the social democratic wing they can’t accept that simple Islam is an intractable creed that has a number of illiberal characteristics such as it is essentially obsessed with sexuality and gender roles, and is based on male authority and submission to God. If the Church of England promoted a set of ideas like this it would be the butt of jokes on every broadcast media from the BBC to Channel 4. The poor sod who expressed the belief that being Gay might not be a lifestyle choice supported by scripture would be demolished personally and probably professionally by the left wing media.\nIn the case of the the left wing however they don’t understand Islamisms power of inter generational cultural purity and its contrast with what the devout see as the cultural slop of secular western culture with its obsessions on err………….well gender, sexuality and an enforced submission to the notion of equality and freedom at all cost.\nThe depth of these differences cannot be overcome by promoting a process of re education as left wing liberals think. This is patronising and has the effect of reminding the devout people of the Islamic faith that western culture is not one that provides the certainty and clarity of lifestyle that their simple expectations require. Education, education education or E3 is unlikely to heal the wounds between Islam and the west.\nSo why won’t E3 work? well people who “learn” do so because they have common reference points. The women who fought for the vote in the 19oo’s understood Choice and Consent because their husbands enjoyed it and to some extent they encountered it too. They simply wanted more of it. When you take a person who believes in male authority and has a family that believes the same and it is believed intergenerationally, it is unlikely to change because some well meaning left winger tells them there is a different way…..a way no more than 50 years old and not based on the Koran but on a creed of free market consumerism which not only allows but encourages all kinds of frightful personal behaviour.\nIf we want to stop being targeted by Islamists we need to first define the decent values we want to promote and change the delinquent behaviours that alienate us from people of faith….all faiths…….. and none.\n28.07.19 Is the role of Housing the same under”Capitalism” as it is in the secular western “free market”…we examine the issue.\nHousing and “Capitalism”! Isn’t “Capitalism” the same as the “free market” and if not why not?\nDoes this differentiation apply outside the UK and US?\nThe housing sector is a very politicized sector with builders being driven by shareholder value whilst the many social housing providers are largely influenced by the demands of “social justice” and the left wing requirement to build homes at any cost as a way of demonstrating a commitment to the poor. Not the economy…but the poor. This “any cost” includes food security and the greenbelt. Private landlords seem to occupy everywhere from a shadowy world of rogue landlords to the high end rental sector. The small private operator clearly didn’t impress George Osborn so he legislated against the sector that has flexibility across a range of tenures, costs and locations. Regulation yes undermining the sector nowe believe.\nSo what is the answer to our complicated question? Well in classical economics and indeed Marxism the housing sector reflected at various levels (class levels) the amount of economic value that was secured by the various classes. So at the lower end the small tenement was squalid and cheap and reflected the fact that the “free” to contract proletarian was paid a meagre share of the value created by him. The rest of the value was appropriated by the capitalist who employed him. His low wage could only pay for a poor quality home so the Christian reformers began to develop decent homes; some linked to employment (Cadbury, Rowntree) others just decent homes (Peabody). The mechanism was clearly redistributive undermining how the capitalist market place (the precursor of the free market) would operate to undermine the interests of the weaker worker against the Capitalist. Evenn if some Capitalists like Cadbury willingly redistributed some of their wealth via decent homes for workers.\nWithin the model above there was however real economic “value”. The economy was value based, profitable and so the redistribution of this value constituted a cost to the capitalist. Now if wages went up (not flat lined by migration) the homes got better and more plentiful. The market operated well with a modest amount of “engineering”from the pioneers of “social housing”. They led the way in decent homes standards.\nAfter 1945 and in the UK with the welfare state altering the economy, things began to change and to compensate for western economic decline within the “Capitalist” model, the “free market” on both sides of the Atlantic evolved, shifting the housing market from being a function of the labour market to being a major constituent of the actual economy itself (remember the 2008 crash).\nThis reliance on housing being a major component of the so called “real economy”seems to us to be why Wizard Osborn wanted to “create” a vibrant private sector housing market with numerous owner occupiers. Via the process we call debtamorphosis the worker became the slave of the debt masters of the “free market”. Poor people fleeced by a government led drive to get them into debt……including housing debt. No where is this better illustrated than student debt.\n“So”……as they say too often today; what should we be doing about all this. Firstly the economy might appear to grow with owner occupation as a sizeable proportion of the housing market, but it is just an illusion based on debt. Within an open economy “debt” doesn’t do what it does in a closed economy….it doesn’t drive value it drives consumption. The housing market undermines the real economy, in our view it creates an asymmetrical economy where people are housed in the wrong place and locked into housing they rely on to supplement their income. It also encourages social and community decline. And let us not forget it is all debt based.\nThe solution is to recognise that housing is and always should be a function of the economy, not a driver of the economy as it is now. So via public housing projects house people in decent homes that are a social asset which are never bastardised to become the financial prop for an enfeebled and misfiring “free market” economy. There will always be a private sector housing market but to stop it being used to support aggregate demand in the wider economy it needs to be counter balanced with a social housing market which actually houses the workers and can move them to where they are needed. Revolutionary indeed!\nFinally is this debt based housing model the same outside the UK and US ? It depends on the economy’s exposure to “owner occupation” and that is determined by how much debt is needed within the economy to support “aggregate demand”and how willing the government is to expose the workers to debt in a desperate bid to “grow” the economy via their home ownership.\n29.07.16 How popular would a blue collar revolution be if it peddled back from a world of debt based immorality and, well……debt. And how could it be done?\nWe hope we have covered what a “Blue Revolution” might look like in the various posts we have made over the last 18 months. We hope anyone reading our posts will get a sense of what we believe and why. If not we are going to try to spend the next six months creating a “Manifesto” for “Blue Revolutionary change”. We are not politicians and don’t want to be. We are interested in ecology, business and economics, politics, psychology and society….in short we are interested in planet earth and its people.\nHowever we believe that just as George Osborn and David Cameron were seduced into adopting the theology of “secular westernism” (the promotion and extension of a debt based, “free market” first developed as Reganomics and Thatcherism but then turbo charged by the slippery Clinton, Blair, Bush Troika) so many of us are benign fellow travellers.\nToo many of us buy into this “theology” of “secular westernism”, laughably the only opposition until recently came from the rather stupid “left wing” who neither understand the nature of the current system (i.e. their solution more debt please to “cure” austerity, oh a bit more government too just to add to the sense of achieving some kind of historical destiny for the masses).\nIn the US Trump and Clinton are both “secular westerners” but one is an intelligent woman the other an oaf. In the UK Theresa May could be the first to challenge the secular western theology with her more “blue collar” cabinet; but it is early days. We believe destiny is knocking on the front door but most people and most politicians are still answering the back door.\nWhat we are encouraged to believe about our culture, we believe, is all total nonsense, whether it is “Remain” as in the EU or “austerity” is class war, or “our way of life” delivers “justice” freedom, democracy and opportunity, or diversity is a benign cultural relativism as opposed to bone headed idiocy fuelling violence in the absence of any form of unifying philosophy based on economics.\nIt seems to us only a Blue Revolution’s collection contributing “workers” can “raise consciousness” in a truly Marxist sense. Hopefully more people will realise that saving the planet, saving our lives and liberties and yes saving the whale, is all down to people adopting the mindset of “A Blue Revolutionary”.\nWith a Blue Revolution there is no club to join, no badge to wear and no “revolutionary vanguard” so beloved of the hard and implacable left; just things to think about, reflect upon and try and assimilate into our own lives based on how each of us experiences our life in the early 21st century.\nAs with all Manifesto’s we will look at various themes. The next one will be “Tackling Debt”. Chapter 1.\n04.08.16 The problem of debt and how our collective love of consumption makes us all the puppets of the global debt meisters V3\nThis is the key to all the western world’s ills. It is something which enslaves us, sets generation against generation makes relationships either fragile of immoral and turns the wheels of “debtamorphosis”; a western banking and governmental process which turns indebtedness into wealth for those who are lucky enough to be the card sharks of the “free market”. These people along with the bankers and the Barons of the publicsectocracy do very nicely at the expense of the poor, the young and the general taxpayer. How has this happened?\nWell if you imagine a see saw 200 years long with a man with a stove pipe hat on one end of the see saw and he has his end on the ground we can call this end “value” and the other end “debt”. We can imagine that as we move from one end of the two hundred year long see saw to the other the balance shifts between “value” and “debt”. After two hundred years the man in the stove piped hat is replaced by a public servant who has his wages paid by government debt.\nAlong with the publicsectocracy we have the mass ranks of debt masters who either create debt or who benefit from debt. The super profits of the supermarkets, the corporations and banks all rely on debt, inflating domestic aggregate demand. It is aggregate demand which keeps profits up, people in a trance like state buying “stuff”, oh, and tax for governments keen to get re elected. Keeping this process going requires a couple of things; it requires increasing asset values (like housing and stock values) as this becomes the basis of lending against the debt.\nAll this is what passes as economic value but of course as 2008 showed us…..it isn’t economic value at all, it is government and societies debt. The whole process is utterly without foundation but economists still talk as though it is somehow “real”. The rubbish spoken by Mark Carney and George Osborne and some economists at the BBC (some have now left thankfully) is simply rehearsing a language based on an economic and social orthodoxy which has no actual value underpinning it.\nin many ways is like making up a language which doesn’t apply to the real world. Or at least changes the meaning of the words. It is a world of borrowing being “investment”, tax no longer being “value” wealth similarly, and debt being the basis for wealth and taxation. The whole system is based on “consumer confidence” in otherwords the whole thing is based on the public’s confidence the system will perpetuate itself. It is kept “real” simply on the basis of this “consumer confidence”; the confidence to borrow, and spend and tax and spend.\nThis debt makes people crave “things” rather than relationships. Everything becomes tradable and this too feeds the free market debt monster. With wealth the consumers main driver rather than social and economic value one family can a morally become two families, two families need two TV’s and the money tied up in the owner occupied family home becomes cashable to sweeten the divorce and provide some much needed aggregate demand to drive further consumption; oh and there is a need for an extra house just to help the house builder and the governments coffers too.\nThe winners are the rich and the publicsectocracy. The losers are the poor and the planet. We said that a Blue Revolution helps to save the whale…well debt is how the current system undermines the planet by driving unsustainable consumption and therefore its damages ecological structures and environments. This includes our living environment both social and economic.\nThe solution to this monster will be time consuming (no pun intended)….well the see saw is two hundred years long; but we can start to shuffle towards the pivot if we firstly accept that we are not living in a world of value but debt and anti austerity is really about more debt.\nRather than thinking that government taxation is taking real value off real capitalists who in the past would have “misappropriated” it from the workers; the capitalist no longer really exist and neither does the value capitalists used to create……at least not in the west. Today we have debtmasters and the wealthy who together manipulate the leavers of the markets to ensure that as much of the debt we and governments create ends up in the hands of the government elite and the wealthy bankers and business persons like the fat peasant Phil Green.\nMarx would have failed to understand this system, he was a classical economist at heart…….so it is odd that the left still hold to the old socialist methods of tackling the problem namely tax and spend. The British left are publicsectorcrats before they are representatives of the workers. Hence the reason they are f****d. More of this later when we consider “Labour isn’t working because “socialism” no longer works; we explain why”………as a service to Corbyn and Smith.\n10.08.16 Why do the left in the UK think their every utterance is “progressive” when in most regards the opposite is actually the case? We consider Grammar schools.\nHere at a Blue revolution we are a mixed bag, some “passed” the 11+ and some “failed”. Some never took it! As we have said before therein lies the problem with promoting selective education. It is seen as better and fairer not to have been tested than to have failed. However, we take a “progressive” view which we believe puts the solid old left ideas about selection into the 20th-century dustbin.\nFirstly the promoters of selection need to stop presenting the 11+ as some kind of test of intelligence and see it more like a psychometric test; a test of aptitude for a certain way of learning. The fact it is seen to be based on intelligence creates for the virtue warriors of the left the obvious link with elitism assisting those who are advantaged by their class.\nIf the test was rigorous, based on maths, and spelling (technical skills) and taken at the age of 13 on an opt-in basis it would be less a stigma not to be identified as non-academic”. The 11 plus is obscure and alienates the very people it should be motivating. It does this by being unrelated to the real world of academic study. It was intended to do this to keep those passing it as exclusive or elite as possible. But in doing this it excludes the children of the workers.\nIt would become by a child’s thirteenth birthday relevant for a small group of children (school or parental referred) within any county or group of counties who maintain a school fully state funded for this very skilled group of young students. If the bar was set high it would escape the claim that the levels of aptitude within the top to middle of the selected sector and non-selected are too similar to justify grammar school selection. The state would bear the cost of such schools where the “students with aptitude” numbers justified it.\nThe second issue is that of class. The old left talk as though a local bank manager, self-employed plumber, the owner of an electricians business or a doctor are upper class. They are not; they are working and earning a living; the fact that they are not part of the left wings new constituency of choice; the underclass, does not make them part of the hated bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie were capitalists not workers regardless of how well paid those workers might be. By keeping the children of ordinary people away from a grammar school education means there is an open goal for the public schools to snaffle the better-paid jobs and stop social mobility in its tracks.\nFinally something “socialist” from the Blue Revolutionaries. Life is about acceptance and not about chips on shoulders. For every John Prescott, there are people without chips on their shoulders who went on to achieve a position in life they were happy with. Lord Prescott is an exemplar of how failing the 11+ isn’t life destroying. However, it will lead to many young people taking the view that they would rather lorry drive or hair dress and save themselves the cost of a university education before errr…….lorry driving or hairdressing.\nWhilst the original reason we believe the grammar schools were scrapped was because public schools were being undermined and the old establishment felt threatened so the bogus claim of “equality for all” was used to preserve privilege for those able to pay for a private education so the current obsession with making all children “academic” even when they are not is we believe about preserving the “academic left” in “their” places of learning. In both cases, children are used ideologically and it is the “masses” and their children who suffer.\nOne final point is about cooperation. No one is an island and there is, in these less “class” obsessed times, more desire to work collaboratively to achieve team and group goals rather than being a battle of class against class. This class war is a 20th-century phenomenon wonderfully captured in the labour relations film comedies of the post-war era . So for every person who is highly academic (and the economy doesn’t need that many of these highly academic types) there will be an army of people upon whom these academic types will come to depend.\nThe next post will look at the “household” as one limb of the western world’s slow recovery.\nNB less class obsessed of course unless you are a left winger for whom class is an issue of existential relevance as well as self-preservation\n13.08.16 Labour isn’t working because “socialism” no longer works. If you still don’t understand why, read on…..V5\nUnfortunately, we have to start with Tony Blair and his cronies who believed that there was nothing wrong with getting “filthy rich”. Again unfortunately, Blair and Bill Clinton’s “third way” was a means by which the workers were exploited in a different way from the “misappropriation” of value to maximize profits under the old largely defunct “capitalist” system. The currency of modern “wealth” is debt not old fashioned value. In classical terms and Marxism, value is different from both profit and price and therefore wealth. We don’t need to concern ourselves with these distinctions here.\nThe capitalist system started to collapse in the west about eighty years ago being replaced by what we at a Blue Revolution call “secular westernism”; the amoral evolution of the “free market”. Secular westernism is even more immoral than “capitalism” as it requires the worker to be a provider of debt to maintain aggregate demand, with the government as the borrower of last resort using its debt and taxation for the same basic purpose.\nThe government also has the job of maintaining “consumer confidence”. This is simply the belief that borrowing and spending can continue into the future and therefore people will continue in jobs and be able to borrow and spend. personal borrowing also includes the most damaging form of indebtedness; student debt.\nThe Cameron Government’s fear of a drop in consumer confidence was clearly in evidence during the “Brexit” referendum with the Wizard of Osborn becoming more and more shrill as the prospect of Brexit became a possibility. For Osborn Brexit would have a damaging effect on “Consumer Confidence”. The fact the EU and the secular western economies globally, are utterly without sound economic foundations was either not recognised or ignored. “Confidence” was all and is all that matters.\nAs long as secular westernism continues to strive to create “confidence” based debt, which becomes, debt based wealth for the publicsectorcrats (the upper reaches of the Public Sector) and the other winners of the “free market”, everyone should be “happy”.\nSo from Thatcher to Osborn (Son’s of Thatcher to Heirs to Blair) the debt-reliant economic system was created and has evolved. With the systems ability to maintain debt and “consumer Confidence” we all continue to spend and borrow. The process creates immoral behaviour; on a structural level by Banks and at a personal level by people having for example children they could never hope to raise without government subsidy, or cashing in housing equity to pay for divorce. The role of the family is diminished as government steps in, to paper over the social cracks created by a bankrupt “real economy”.\nSocialism’s most dangerous tactic is to promote the idea that the government and its bureaucracy is a substitute for a properly functioning social and economic system. The legacy when failure comes will be to “progress us” back to the dark ages and woe betide a range of currently legitimate lifestyle choices when that happens. Gay people, feminists, and a plethora of others who have rights to contract choose and consent to lifestyles choices now, will be unprotected when the state will to too broke to protect them in the future even if ….and it’s a big if, it wanted to. This war of attrition on Contract Choice and Consent is being rehearsed in Europe by the bum fluff sporting disciples of ISIS. Contract Choice and Consent is what they hate…….as do strident socialists. Corbyn in particular is reckless with the three C’s particularly around women’s rights and the rights of the Jewish minority in his party. The reason is, these people think they understand socialism and how it has to be delivered; but to understand socialism you MUST properly understand Capitalism and how it evolved….and they want to smash capitalism not see it evolve as it must.\nSo where does our economic critique of socialism come in. Well in the old days “socialists” recognised the “capitalist” was rendering the environment toxic with pollution and the workers lives poor, uncertain and unhealthy via low wages. The Socialist’s mission was to take the surplus value “stolen” from workers ( the capitalist’s profit) by the capitalists, and to redistribute it. In doing so rendering the environment cleaner and with welfare safer and less uncertain. This simple idea is very complex because it is prefaced on the basis that “capitalism” should and does deliver “value” and therefore there is only immorality in the Capitalist keeping the lions share of the value as profit. It also assumes there is no immorality in the socialist taking and redistributing the value.\nSo far so good…Eventually the Keys of the Capitalist machine (Contract, Choice and Consent, Land Labour and Capital) are enjoyed by the workers. By then via collaboration. The liberated and now unexploited workers continue to deliver value both social and economic and also by this time the “state has withered away” and the system is wholly collectivist. This is social collectivism as well as economic but without the government mediating. The last bit is a bit fanciful….even Marx struggled to define this period with no state and total collectivism. The period of no state is centuries away. However the “socialist” bit we can visualise as we have created it already. And there in lies the explanation of why socialism no longer works.\nThe current economy (with government costs a large burden and clearly not in any way a withered state) is now reliant on workers “Debt” not workers mis-appropriated “value”. This is not an economy that governments can morally intervene with to redistribute….because what are they redistributing exactly?\nGovernments thrive off the GDP figures which a debt based economy still obsesses about (ask yourself why construction and housing are so important to the health of our current economy). Any attempt to correct the injustice of “capitalism’s past exploitation of the workers” has no relevance today as there is no value to liberate, but any diminution in debt will damage GDP the confidence so craved by the chancellor and bankers . The debt machine must stop…….and this is seen as a bad thing!\nIf you are still with us you will recognise that the exploitation the government covertly supports is no longer by capitalist bosses taking workers surplus value, but is the exploitation is by the financial sector and state itself, encouraging the indebtedness of the government itself in tandem with the debt of the individual. Debt is morally the worst kind of exploitation if it isn’t to encourage part of a functioning mixed economy underpinning a stable and morally sustainable society.\nBasically the Anti Austerity brigade, Corbyn, Smith and the more bamboozled Tories still believe that when Governments fund themselves through tax they are legitimately re appropriating “Workers Value” on behalf of the workers, rather than doing as they unfortunately are doing, encouraging the workers to support the free market via debt based consumption, thus creating an army of the “filthy rich” so loved by Blair. This overzelous public spending is therfore debt that ends up being spent by the Government on running Government and on the pensions and welfare system containing unproductive people. It undermines not only the economy but society as well. The idea that there is anything “social” about socialism paid for by debt is laughable. But we can’t let people starve so we have to re engineer the system and do it slowly and sustainably.\nSo what do we at a Blue Revolution think the future should look like? Here are a few ideas. Ask yourself how “socialist is it”:\nClean water and air, safe homes (Private and public, owner occupied and rental), safe places to work, a reduction in “stuff” manufactured for the sake of profit based on debt (also good for the environment, less production means less emissions). A smaller state. Operational workers (in health etc) paid decently, but a massive rescaling of salaries for the people who are paid at the top to deliver nothing at the bottom. Reform of higher education to end the “jobs for Guardian readers” hegemony in higher education. A welfare system that recognises that welfare is a government transfer of cost for the unproductive individual i.e. from the worker to the non worker and theretofore lacks “natural justice” and often encourages immorality. A recognition that debt as a means of delivering wealth to sustain consumption is doomed to fail with devastating consequences when it does fail….and it will.\nReducing demand reduces stress on eco systems and the environment as well as requiring a shift towards a more sustainable economic model. This Blue economic model does not contain the myth that the government is doing good by playing God but by making the public dependent on welfare and debt it is undermining long term social survival of the positive legacy of capitalism (Contract, Choice and Consent) and also undermining its own legitimacy.\nThe challenge is; how do we achieve change? Well, we need to stop seeing “Socialism” as the answer for a start.\nIf you still don’t understand it…..you are either in thrall to the western secular paradigm or you are yet to have your consciences raised.\n18.8.16 The white boys under perform and we still have to tackle a lack of cultural integration; Blue Revolution explains why we have not improved things…..yet. V4\nAnyone who was working in the British public sector in the “Blair years” will have been exposed to an attempted brainwashing with “diversity” training. The aim was benign enough; we are all the same really. However, the model was feeble in that it didn’t empower people to challenge discrimination unless it was premised on the power imbalance between black and white. There was, therefore, an unintended boost given to those cultural simplicities that promote a range of discriminations; against women in particular but also against Jews and those of different sexualities. In Britain and within the EU people could not find it in themselves to challenge a range of actual behaviours which reflect this discrimination. A silence was believed to be the best ploy.\nHow wrong that was and unfortunately still is. Diversity was intended to promote the idea that we are all the same underneath our skin and culture, however, it overstressed the difference in a morally confused environment of hand-wringing and embarrassment. So far so bad.\nAt a Blue Revolution we believe the reason for this was our old friend the confused and morally ambiguous “western liberal culture”. This is a culture which in its economic manifestation promotes consumerism and debt (secular westernism) and therefore offers no unimpeded economic infrastructure demanding the creation of value via an economically literate, self-aware and motivated workforce. Its moral ambiguity which promotes pornography and a general disregard for the lives of vulnerable people, also allows people to become economically inactive and welfare dependent. What this means for society is that with no strong moral principles people slide to the lowest possible social and economic level.\nThe white working class find themselves in casual promiscuous relationships with the bonus of welfare babies for the girls, with the boys enjoying the toxicity of casual sex which too often becomes a preoccupation overtaking the need to earn a living. The welfare model also allows families to maintain relationships along traditional lines. The number of men of Pakistani descent driving taxis suggests that in work welfare keeps family income at a level which allows wives to remain within a traditional family structure.\nAs we have seen with the Labour party’s lamentable treatment of Asian women in places like Dewsbury there is little opportunity for women when the local culture still harbours the view that man has dominion over women. It also doesn’t help that western culture is sexually preoccupied……which it is. So with this asymmetry and a “diversity culture” of “don’t ask don’t tell” within a free market culture, there is nothing driving integration. Integration if it is going to happen needs an economic foundation. Whilst Capitalism couldn’t have offered “diversity” preferring conformity (the standardised “worker”), it did offer Contract Choice and Consent which is now under threat from diversity. Perverse but true.\nIn the pre-secular western world of “capitalism” the workers would have had to work, wages would be the only source of income and with no welfare “top ups” babies would have rightly been a financial liability for hopefully loving parents, not financial asset for the sexually reckless Within a family all of working age would have to be at work. A lack of financial security would have resulted in a levelling of rights for all. The Contract, Choice and Consent (three C’s) would have been the basis for all relationships, women, school leavers, wives, husbands, fathers and mothers. It was capitalism’s potential to underpin real integration and equality with choice and consent at least in a non-wealth sense.\nSo what is the solution? Well, here at a Blue Revolution we believe in the three C’s but don’t believe these rights can be exercised in a community motivated by debt and made fat on welfare. We believe that the economy needs to properly re-balance so that families are responsible for children up to and beyond the age of 60…..yes sixty. The “child” is no longer a homogenous “factor of production” destined for “the Pit” factory or to raise a family. This is because the social, psychological and economic environment is too complex. However, work and the social nature of people has to be promoted within a new framework which reflects the reality of a “Post-Capitalist”economy. This has to have a basis in the real economy to avoid being a sort of Corbyn utopianism. Let us take an extreme example.\nIf a child has Aspergers or autism they are diagnosed and then essentially pushed out of the working environment which is still geared for the 40-hour week worker. The same applies to the ex-offender. The opportunity to manage their lives based on a possible combination of co-operation from family and community plus employment arranged on a flexible basis is not really an option. The welfare environment does not currently reflect the desire of many people to genuinely “promote diversity”. A Diversity agenda without some kind of economic model underpinning it is just utopianism or as we call it “waffle”. Because it is just a waffle no one takes it seriously, so after twenty years of brainwashing we have no significant integration, white boys underperform, there is little cultural integration. The disabled find it hard to enter the work place and the mentally ill are sidelined by the economy but can get counselling. Offenders become a breeding nuisance.\nPeople who can’t do forty hours per week but get trapped on welfare are pushed out of the workplace. society is about as un”diverse” as it is possible to get whilst being just about able to claim it is “striving for diversity”. Yet the economy is flexible enough to offer some solutions. The answer is not simple but change is possible. We should not expect the government to determine the standards by which we live our economic and social lives. That creeping nationalisation of our lives via welfare, nieve diversity agendas, a criminal justice system that scoops people out of society, undermines all of us as individuals, families, households and communities. The government, of course, has got a role, but to comply with our three C’s it has to be more complex than delivering welfare on demand which as we have seen diminishes equality, opportunity and diminishes standards for white working class boys and Asian women. The welfare trap needs slowing down whilst people are expected to support themselves with the support of their family in the first instance. Of course, the left will claim this is socially divisive rather than socially liberating. But with people taken out of the economy by “welfare” socialism has no plan for integration other than more welfare.\nAs usual, the well-intentioned hand wringers make the problems of life for ordinary people worse by trying to get them to conform to a standard model of social existence in a consumer obsessed welfare reliant and debt dependent early 21st century, rather than letting our diverse economy shape a diverse society unimpeded.\n24.08.16 Many people think they know who is in the much derided “establishment” ….but unless you view it from a Blue Revolutionary perspective you are unlikely to see your friends amongst its ranks or indeed yourself ! V2\nOwen Jones has had a go, and with his outriders and others seemed to see almost everyone in well connected Britain falling into the establishment; except himself of course. However, the litmus test for “who is in and out” of the establishment was Brexit. There are those who are not Jones like “out-riders”, but are lower ranking “establishment figures”; those who like a modern day overlord support the power of the establishment because they gain from its patronage and protection.\nBefore embarking on our Blue Revolutionary analysis we want to make it clear that whilst the monarchy provides some of the trappings of rank for the establishment; titles, gongs etc the monarchy its self is not “establishment” at least not in Blue Revolutionary terms. This difference in opinion casts our Blue Revolution as very different from our rather eccentric, very earnest Red Revolutionary student activist cousins. For us the presence of the monarch is of little consequence to the way power is acquired, passed on and used in 21st century Great Britain. We also dismiss the “fourth” estate……perhaps with the exception of some elements of the Broadcast media as “establishment”. For us, the terms establishment and anti-establishment are about as relevant today as they would have been during and after the English Civil war. The terms could only be applied in any meaningful sense by outsiders, and just like then, today there are very few of them around. Most of us think we are one thing when perhaps we might actually be the other. How so?\nAll periods have those who have negotiated their way close to the top. The top is determined by two things; the way value is created and who it is distributed to. Those negotiating their way to the top are identified by how much of the wealth from the top they have been able to acquire for themselves. In feudal times the king distributed wealth, or the ability to gain wealth to favoured noblemen. In capitalist times exploitation was mediated by wages. Workers free to contract in a system designed to enable the capitalist to appropriate value from the workers who create it, by paying a wage much lower than the value created by the worker.\nThere is nothing immoral about this system as it is based on “consent” but the skill of the capitalist (entrepreneurialism) is rewarded more than the workers who create his profit. The king and his court, the lower ranking barons are the “establishment” in feudalism. The Sheriff is a minor functionary but still his position is made possible by the role he plays in the feudal state.\nWithin capitalism, the establishment still had to endure the presence of the old establishment (lords and the monarchy) but over time, the contractual choice based relationships in capitalism moved the old establishment away from the centre of power. The new establishment was capitalist and the branches of State such as law, the Church, education and parliament became infused with the values of this new capitalist establishment. With Contract, Choice and Consent at the core of the capitalist system liberty became a right if not exactly an achievable right. The workers were “exploited” in Marxist terms their rights were real but irrelevant due to the poverty too many of the workers experienced.\nThe capitalist establishment was unwilling to look at this issue of poverty and charities set themselves up to protect the vulnerable. Protecting young women in service from exploitation for example. Into the establishment, therefore emerged radicals. These people knew how the system worked and could see that it was unfair. The capitalist system allowed rights but for the poor, women and the disabled the rights to contract, choose and consent was limited by the lack of wealth these marginal groups had at their disposal.\nEventually, the “radicals”won the day and by 1945 the majority Labour government was able to deliver more contract, choice and consent, backed up by a fairer “distribution of wealth”. This was probably the finest hour for socialism. It needed “investment” in a bureaucracy to deliver the desired social and economic outcomes. However, the social and economic outcomes became a disease which slowly undermined the economy culminating in the winter of discontent in the 1970’s and high levels of moral decay as people gave up personal responsibility to the government. This period was the point at which the “new establishment”; the post-Capitalist establishment began to assert itself. It had an agenda to promote; itself, public sector services are based on the values the new establishment believes should be widely understood by the people.\nHowever, the values it promoted were ultimately found to be of benefit to them only. The Banking crisis was not delivered just by banks but by banks on behalf of the government. Government reliant on financial services to create debt which becomes the basis for economic confidence and “growth” via consumption. With too much debt and an “economy” based on consumption the social fabric of society disintegrates and the state has to step in, crime goes up and the state steps in. We call this theun-virtuall circle. It is all paid for by debt….the nonsense of debt being “investment” is something only socialists still believe. Debt is a burden on the public but it keeps the new establishment in place. It protects the publicsectocracy. The publicsectocracy and the banks dance a very involved tango which sees the government depending on the central banks who maintain confidence to gain greater and greater levels of indebtedness thus keeping consumption levels up. Whilst they are low ranking the universities provide establishment “cheerleaders” and lots of indebted students pay to become cheerleaders too.\nSo who are the new establishment; well the Remain group in the Brexit debate contain many of them; people who would prioritise bloated European bureaucracy and “progressive” EU law ahead of dealing with the indebtedness of the British economy are part of the establishment. They believe in their own jobs and euro jobs not the success of an independent British economy. The bankers are the money men of the new establishment and part of the new establishment itself. However, they are not the top of the tree. At the bottom of the establishment tree are public sector workers on 100K plus (Chief constables, top Civil Servants etc), “progressive left” often unionised public sector workers are the new establishments “drones” (in the bee sense!), actors who have a simpering view of the “poor” but can’t see that their wealth is illegitimate as their wages are determined by “corporations” not “consumers” but like everything else their fees or wages based on debt.\nThe top of the new establishment is tree are driven by strong but often misplaced values and a sanctimonious belief that the British people are uninformed, bigoted, and stupid. Britain needs educating to promote the correct values. The top people read the “Guardian” and are able to use law to square many of their political circles. They acquire power from the state and the law, which they use directly or indirectly to deliver laws which protect their interests. This all too often means “protecting” people but also institutions. The Courts are part of the new establishment, delivering via the Human Rights Act case outcomes which promote the interests of the new establishment their allies and apologists. Politics, law and medicine are three pillars of the “new establishment”, however, if there is one group who can rally be said to “top off” the ” new establishment it is …….\n……….ladies and gentlemen, liberal lawyers and in particular those who are also politicians. Politicians are still top of the power tree. These politician lawyers use the law to manipulate the state and promote their own self-interest and the interests of their fellow travellers. This explains the relationship between the banks, the rich and New Labour and Cameron Tories. The new establishment is however under threat from an even newer emerging blue-collar establishment; the political representatives of the people; Nigel Farage, Theresa May, Liam Fox, David Davis and Boris Johnson politicians who the people are able to trust in the main (at least for now) as they so obviously have no links to “the new establishment”. Corbyn, Saunders and Trump gain support for being anti-establishment but only Saunders really is a political outsider, the other two……..Enough said.\nThe “old new establishment” The “heirs to Blair and Blair himself are a risk to Contract, Choice and Consent and are a risk to the British people because they don’t like what British people believe and see the views of the British people as a threat to their “progressive values”. Their values simply promote their interests. If Contract Choice and Consent don’t deliver their view of progress, like a Remain outcome…then ignore the outcome. Democracy indeed! more like a Platonic rule by Guardians….Cheri and Tony, Bill and Hilary anyone……No thought not.\nWith Brexit the old new establishment has had its nose rubbed in it and for most of us, it looks and feels great. Now it is time for the people, the masses, who generate social and economic value to drive politicians away from their obsession with creating wealth for the few within a “progressive” administrative culture that traps people in poverty, undermines real equality and promotes perhaps unintentionally “immoral outcomes”. All people need to start to think about how they can create economic and social value for the many…….a blue revolution.\n25.08.16 A Clinton or Trump Presidency is an opportunity for Britain post Brexit.\nTrump offers comic stupidity and has his wall sending his message to a largely politically illiterate but rightly angry constituency of blue collar workers. Clinton offers dull conformity with the prevailing orthodoxy of debtamorphosis. This requires the workers to accept government and personal indebtedness to keep the levers and buttons of the state and economy turning. The purpose; to enable the state to continue employing well-heeled Oxbridge or Ivy league graduates from a certain class background to “run” things. All this whilst pretending it is really all about maintaining aggregate demand and “consumer confidence”.\nThis flawed model is going to tip the western economies over the edge sometime around 2025. But by then Clinton, the likely presidential winner, will be out of office with a pile of debt based wealth in her personal bank account and chaos on America and Europe’s streets. Having paid its debtamorphosis to the wealthy, they will walk away and leave the chaos to the poor. The “progressive” left consensus will have endowed the Blairs and Clintons with unfathomable wealth as we all struggle to survive in a society of little or no social or economic value. Gosh it sounds horrifying but the west is beyond the thin end of the wedge; just look at the state of family life (social value) and the reliance on debt as the real productive economy declines is significance.\nClintons adherence to this “progressive” model in the US is almost certain. This “progressive” economic model is or was the model that underpinned the EU and with the UK sensibly getting out there is an opportunity for an alternative model to be offered and the trickery of the current model to be exposed. With Osborn and Cameron no longer in office, Theresa May can look at scaling back debt, expose the con trick of debtamorphosis inherent within “anti-austerity ” claptrap of the “left” and its fans and beneficiaries. She can rebalance the British economy in favour of production instead of debt, get unskilled work back in the hands of unskilled British workers, whilst at the same time promote a fair but selective education system which will hopefully get the children of blue collar and lower managerial workers into the establishment where the expectations of ordinary people will become better understood.\nAllied to these domestic changes, the possibility exists for Britain to offer a social and economic model to the world as with Clinton and Trump there is an absence of global leadership and a lack of a new but realistic global vision. We can aspire to create a world that can trade widely on the basis Contract, Choice, and Consent. With scaled back welfare underpinning the economic model we can incentivise work, free movement can be liberalised to those who want to come and work , taxes can be reduced and what is left of the social fabric of the country used to rebuild family life as the state is no substitute for the family and community. The world needs a moral revolution and Britain is well placed to lead the way.\n28.08.16 The point about HS2 is that no one can really remember the point. We offer some guidance for those who want it.\nHS2 belongs to an age oh about ten years ago when “major infrastructure projects” were seen as the salvation of the economy by New Labour. There were two basic reasons; they were seen as a good in themselves in the case of HS2 trimming twenty minutes off a journey time to London, but most importantly they were seen as a way of pumping money into the economy via wages and the purchase of raw materials. This is neo-Keynesianism and of course, it doesn’t work. It doesn’t work because the world economy is open and thus money is not really “invested” it is borrowed and “spent” on vanity projects like HS2 and the wages paid contribute to immediate consumption. Much of this consumption is often “off- shored” or spent on foreign goods and holidays. And it is of course raised from the indebtedness of the British people. So it won’t have the “multiplier” effect it would have had in post-war Britain when there were limits on how much currency you could take out of the country.\nGiven the fact that the contractors moreover are often not British the advantages to the economy are limited to the final outcome of the infrastructure project itself. In the case of HS2 this will be to draw people to London by train with a saving of twenty minutes and a subsidised cost for that twenty minutes saving of goodness knows how much. The government will have ratcheted up debt and the money spent will achieve little more than maintaining immediate consumption for those undertaking the job of building HS2.\nIt fails the economic necessity over cost and long-term economic impact test. Basically, we think it is a waste of money.\n30.08.16 The legacy of the Blair years the “third way” a combination of socialism and greed. Lets look at who has their snout in the trough.\nSocialism, as we have explained before, is a product of advanced capitalism. The capitalist system offers important rights to all people ( we summarise them as Contract, Choice and Consent), however, only the capitalist and the wealth remnants of the feudal age, the aristocracy, enjoyed them to their full extent. Socialism was the result. It was a grass-roots movement by workers and more progressive bourgeoisie to deal with the of the imbalances within capitalism. Many 19th century capitalists were benign but the system created insecurity and uncertainty for workers. It was not a benign system. However much to the fury of modern “progressives” it worked. It created value, social and economic and it put bread on the table for the vast majority of western workers. It was the value capitalism created that formed the basis for socialism’s initial programme of reform and redistribution. In the UK this happened after the last war. In the US and over the same time-scale it was a martial plan; “welfare” for taking up arms on behalf of the state and going into foreign theatres of war. The governments in both countries began to acquire the nation’s productive value to pursue its political objectives.\nIn Britain, the lack of aspiration following on from the lack of Contract, Choice and Consent was an early target of the new socialist government. Mistakes on the way included wrongly ascribing fostering inequality to the Grammar schools, undermining the stability of the family with welfare, and driving enterprise and industry out of the country whilst promoting the acquisition of wealth which is devoid of actual value. We call this debtamorphosis; the process by which government or a consumer’s debt becomes someone’s wealth.\nBy the early 1990’s the “yellow brick road” of wealth acquisition was beguiling governments and those who would aspire to be wealthy. Businesses were manufacturing abroad and selling here at prices that got the consumer into debt but made the “business man” very rich. Shopping Centres or Malls were springing up and work was becoming minimum wage and unskilled. This wealth was important to Governments as they have spending commitments and needed to tax it. However, it was also important for the wealthy to overlook the debt based origins of their wealth, and try and avoid paying tax on it. It is staggering to think that you make more profit selling something than you make producing it. But that is the nature of the global economy. This system was largely created by the free marketeers of the Thatcher-Regan era. However, we don’t believe the full implications of this system were fully understood.\nThis wealth created by the economy was important to Governments as they have spending commitments and needed to tax it. However, it was also important for the wealthy to overlook the debt based origins of their wealth, and try and avoid paying tax on it. It is staggering to think that you make more profit selling something than you make producing it. But that is the nature of the global economy. This system was largely created by the free marketeers of the Thatcher-Regan era. However, we don’t believe the full implications of this system were fully understood.\nAs we said there was a drift into low wage employment, value creating jobs were disappearing in favour of service jobs, but along with the value creating jobs mainly in manufacturing, “organised labour” was being pushed out too. Life for workers was getting uncertain again. But the workers themselves didn’t help. The 1970’s confirmed that when bosses and workers stop thinking about the product and go into battle over wages the economy and individuals suffer. For a Blue Revolution, the greatest tragedy was the appalling industrial relations of the 1970’s and the pointless battles between workers and bosses that destroyed the economy. Had the workers known that manufacturing could be outsourced to China would they have been so stupid and to destroy their jobs and industries. If they known their jobs would be replaced by jobs dependent on debt, would they have been so keen to see their industries collapse; had the government realised that people were getting rich…..stupidly rich, creating nothing much at all…selling sort of cheap “stuff”, would they have tolerated this Alice in wonderland world and, more importantly, would they have relied on it for tax revenue to pay for their social and economic vanity projects.\nWell, of course they would, because by the late 1990’s Blair and co saw the money this model was delivering into the economy and were “casual” about people being rich because they had no idea how the money was created. Their economic illiteracy, however, was compounded by an old socialist agenda of wealth redistribution, and a desire to “socially engineer”a better society. Any student of Karl Marx would have known that social progress was a function of the economy, and regulated capitalism had done a reasonable job to date ( we accept not perfect) providing freedom based on work rather than race, gender or any other “improper” basis to use current parlance. However, to Blair and Co, the wealth of tycoons like Phillip Green was real, based on real value, had solid origins not sweat shop origins, and along with what tax could be extracted from his fawning tycoon fan base Blair could, along with government borrowing, create the ideal “third way” socialist society. Socialism relying on greed….the origins of secular westernism.\nAnyway, the dissonance between the aspirations of the blue collar workers and the Blair elite has become more exposed as the smoke and mirrors basis for the economy has been exposed for the fraud it really is. Politicians who should represent people representing corporations. Politicians who should be creating the conditions for business, protecting corporations ahead of struggling workers and small businesses. A social agenda which, inspired by the EU wrapped small and medium business up in red tape whilst protecting corporations by subsidising workers wages. The rich men of Blair and Cameron’re economy were little more than card sharks skimming the politicians for all they could get away with. The moral decline goes hand in hand with this economic madness.\nThe final part of the process, of course, is the law. Blair and his gullibility did not only expose the economy to risk but by buying into the idea that business was good but public bodies were in need of scrutiny and were inherently bad he engineered the rise of the human rights industry. We all understand human rights, public bodies can’t hit you, steal from you or otherwise abuse you, but we have gone beyond the actual law into an Alice in wonderland law, a law which as Marx would attest reflects the fundamentals of the Alice in Wonderland economy. Nice work Tone!",

The Islamic authorities say so. Read our letter to Zac Goldsmith MP.\nDear Mr Goldsmith 17 August 2019\nFor several years there has been a debate about the use of ritual slaughter and how this can be reconciled with the grizzly business of slaughtering animals as humanely as possible. The UK is said to have a good reputation for animal welfare whilst ignoring the fact that in Halal and Kosher slaughter there is no pre-stunning and animals have their throats cut whilst fully conscious. We are a small group of people some of whom identify as Marxists and we wish to offer a contribution to this troubled debate based on the reality of ritual slaughter within the Qur’an\nArguments that are used to challenge ritual slaughter refer to the welfare of the animal. For those communities for whom an uncritical acceptance of divine authority is a cultural expectation, it is unlikely a welfare argument will be persuasive. Uncritical acceptance of religious doctrine is something that in the west we are no longer familiar with. The religious doctrines of the Qur’an (called into being by the Archangel Gabriel dictating the word of God to the prophet Mohammed) and a strong sense of religious identity are often contrasted with the lack of a coherent cultural identity in the west. What is perceived by western people as a strength, creating dynamic diverse communities, may be viewed as a threat to communities who wish to retain a distinct and doctrinal identity based on their understanding of the word of God.\nThe expectation that the west uncritically accepts halal slaughter, therefore, gets combined with westerner’s desire to have ‘diversity’ within their communities and the welfare of animals gets overlooked.\nIt is in our opinion possible to encourage diversity whilst also being cognizant of the need to protect the welfare of animals during slaughter. The hygiene obligations and rituals surrounding slaughter are clearly tailored for the realities of the seventh century, hence the need to ensure animals for slaughterer is healthy so the meat to be consumed is fresh and has not been contaminated by disease or after death by animals in the wild. Once these requirements have been addressed and an animal is fit for slaughter the offering of a prayer respects the dignity of the animal about to die. It is at this point that modern ‘halal’ slaughter seems to us to part company with the traditional expectations of Islam.\nIslam requires excellence in all matters pertaining to the slaughter of animals *. Animals are a gift from Allah and their slaughter reflects rites other than just the use of prayer before slaughter and no pre-stunning. The animal must be calmed and must be slaughtered quickly and expertly with a sharp knife and without any awareness of what is likely to happen to it. It must not be slaughtered within the vicinity of other animals due for slaughter simply to avoid its own and their distress.\nSuch practices clearly reflect the Quranic expectation of small-scale ritual animal slaughter but are a requirement of Islam and therefore should be observed as halal. The industrial slaughter of cattle and sheep required today because of the greed of a consumer society is out of step with halal to such an extent, the non-use of stunning alone cannot qualify the slaughtered meat as halal and therefore the justification for no pre-stunning is totally without doctrinal foundation or justification. Indeed, pre-stunning may ‘calm’ the animal.\nOn the basis that the Qur’an requires animals to be at ease at the time of their slaughter and that industrial slaughtering is not and can never be halal within the requirements of Islam please can you consider supporting the abolition of halal slaughter except in circumstances where due to low volumes of animals being killed appropriate observance can be made of the strict rules that apply within the faith of Islam.\nBlue Revolution\n*Abu Ya’la Shaddad ibn Aws narrated the relevant hadith",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-history-of-politics-simplified/content_160.html": "The history of politics, simplified.\nThe history of politics, simplified.\nBlue Revolution.\nWhen it comes to politics, we all feel confused. ‘Left’, ‘Right’ or maybe ‘Centre’. Liberal or totalitarian, Socialist, Revolutionary Socialist. What all these political ideas lack is a broad understanding by ordinary people.\nPolitical change has always involved a small group of sometimes angry people like some of those above taking control of the state in the name of ‘the people’. This has never been a good idea, but it continues to go on, even now. Politics is therefore about power, who has it, how they get it and what they do with it.\nThis pamphlet was written to help the curious. It adopts a modern theory based on peoples’ experience. We call it ‘lived reality’. Today it reflects the reality of living in a globalised ‘free market’, but ‘lived reality’ works just as well for the lives of people in the past.\nOur lived reality, therefore, describes how we got to where we are economically, politically and socially.\nAccording to the Blue Revolution, all political decisions should be grounded in the reality of all working people- not a small minority. The last time this happened was thousands of years ago when we lived in tribal communities.\nIn Box\nPolitics is confusing. Too many political ideas are in existence with many ideas conflicting. Politics is all about how politicians, be they kings, political party members or business leaders get power, or influence those who have it. But it is also about how ordinary people experience the power of politics.\nChapter one\nPower in ‘tribal’ communities. A harsh equality starting in the Middle East.\nThe earliest type of organisation is the tribe: a community of people and basic rules and principles which ensured order.\nRules controlled every aspect of life. For example, ‘marriage’, which today is a legal ‘contract’ between two adults in tribal times was instead an arrangement between different males and females in a tribe. In a tribe, rules were just accepted. Broken rules were punishable by death in order to preserve the values necessary to protect all its members.\nThings like child marriage were not considered strange, the average age of death was 33 years old. The tribes’ survival depended upon it. Child ‘marriage’ minimised problems of adjustment by putting children in different households at a very early age.\nReligion evolved from economic necessity and reflected the need for survival. Religions were used to legitimate authority and control behaviour. Stability created economic and social value.\nTribal rules required a fair distribution to all. Generally, men hunted while women reared children and were homemakers. There was a strict division of labour, but men and women would have been equally as important to the maintenance of the tribe. This is the sort of world that Islam’s prophet Muhammed would have known and explains why Islamic ideas take the form they do and why some Muslims are outraged by modern criticism of what are essentially the social and economic values portrayed in the Qur’an. ‘Islamism’ is an attempt by some radicalised Muslims to promote these ideas and impose them on others by force. They unquestioningly accept as ‘truth’ the Muslim holy book the Qur’an.\nMost but not all tribal societies evolved over many thousands of years. Australia and what became the USA before Europeans arrived, were cut off from the economic melting pot of the Mediterranean and Middle East, so it meant that economic and social evolution failed to happen.\nThese Australian and North American tribes remained completely intact until European settlers revolutionised their ‘reality’ and changed their society by changing their economy. These tribes went from simple hunting and gathering to overt control based on the top down authority of the imported Christian church and British and Dutch monarchy. Even today some individuals have not adjusted to this cultural change of pace and like many people in the twenty-first century, are culturally conflicted or confused.\nTry and imagine being part of a tribe in the Middle East or Mediterranean as it evolved between 5000 to 500 BC. Life was harsh with continual fighting for resources between tribes, but generally within the tribe itself, things were harmonious. Everyone had a role and values were simple even though practices like child marriage, cruelty or banishment of those who broke ‘tribal custom’ may have been normal.\nThere would be little rule breaking as people would have been socialised to conform by repetition of rules. You can still see the repetition of rules practised in certain communities today. Think about a person’s reality if they live in the western world having migrated here from non-western communities where ‘traditional’ values are still important. They may have to come to terms with rules or behaviour, some of which might be incompatible with their own culture of origin.\nImagine what tribal communities would make of western culture; our freedom, absence of different roles based on our sex as well as our different sexual lifestyles, our apparent lack of care for the elderly and our unregulated sexual behaviour. Our modern lives may be classed as immoral. Tribes had to have all these things under some sort of control. There was no choice.\nThose with a desire to maintain simple faith-based or tribal values and practices may struggle to adapt to the modern free market and reject our twenty-first-century values. This has led some liberal-minded western people to play down the impact of traditional cultural practices on those from non-western backgrounds even when those practices conflict with western values of free choice and consent. This ‘liberal’ approach promotes the interests of certain groups instead of the individuals within those groups.\nMany modern westernised people would find it hard in a strict tribal society. For the modern westerner, our reality is based on personal and economic freedom underpinned by our experience of the free market. Today we desire individual choice!\nCultural ‘conflict’ therefore is caused by lived realities being based on different sets of economic and social expectations. Globalisation is responsible, but western governments are to blame for the problems this causes. They do this by failing to promote the rights of individuals in the face of demands for collective rights, which may discriminate against groups, for example women. The demand by some groups to protect religious practice is one such example where individual and collective rights conflict.\nIt isn’t possible to adopt, promote or impose one simple set of moral rules and maintain personal choice. The contradiction for militant Islamists is that whereas tribal values were coherent with the economics of tribal society militant Islamists want to impose simple religious values on non-tribal twenty-first-century societies….by force.\nIn box\nOnce we all lived in tribes and accepted simple tribal values. There was economic equality within tribal communities but different roles for men and women. Today conflict comes if different sets of values based on different economic expectations clash.\nChapter two\nHumanities first Revolution. Political power becomes normal as kings take control.\nIn the Middle East, around six thousand years ago, tribal society started to change due to technological improvements. These improvements created the first agricultural revolution and gave rise to power by a minority over the many, political power! This helped create the Middle Eastern faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. All these faiths tried to deal with the unfairness of political power by turning simple values into a set of ‘moral’ behaviours for all people.\n‘Top-down’ control (which is like feudalism, as well as other systems of top-down authority) came about because people were able to organise the economy so that surplus food was available (a bit like a profit). To begin with, it was not a money surplus, but as people created more food than was needed, it became possible to trade and eventually money and wealth became possible. Inequality was born! A few people who did not work themselves could acquire wealth from the work of others.\nAs a result, ‘immoral’ behaviours like prostitution and adultery became possible. These would be activities almost impossible in tribal society but with surplus food production, people were more than able to support women (or men) who provided sex. It was also possible for rich men to support ‘their’ women, so some women did not have to work as they had to do in tribes. Patriarchal society was born, and the control of women in society began.\nIn its latter stages this period was an era when art and beautiful artefacts could be created by artisans, who were paid to create beauty rather than to hunt for food.\nThis economic revolution obviously changed peoples lived realities. The Old and New Testament of the Jewish and Christian faith and the Qur’an plus other religious views expressed by the prophet Muhammad are all about trying to re-establish a virtuous society during this period of economic upheaval.\nOver thousands of years, where surplus value was created the bonds of tribal society were permanently broken, allowing a minority of people, an elite, to take the surplus value from working people and slaves and make it their own. They used this economic advantage to create and maintain power structures, so they could dominate and control ordinary people. Once this authoritarian system was established, life would never be the same again for billions of ordinary people.\nCan you imagine how the Reality of the majority was affected by this significant economic and social change? People had lost tribal loyalty, tribal equality and predictability and were now subject to authority from elite minorities. For ordinary people, life was a complex mix of submission to various authorities, observance of religious rules and working hard to create property and wealth for others.\nAuthoritarian societies were thus considered by many to be very bad indeed. With economies in the hands of greedy kings, this era became humanities ‘nation building’. It started in the Mediterranean and Middle East with the earliest power based authoritarian systems in Egypt and Iraq. These authoritarian systems existed when other people, even in the same area of the world were still living in simple tribal society.\nThe ‘top-down’ model created by feudalism and similar authoritarian systems was very efficient and is still used today in politics and public service and public administration. People at the top of organisations and their ‘leadership teams’ make ‘decisions’ and as a result, earn more than the people creating the value whether it be an economic surplus value (profit) or social value (e.g. caring for society). It is not the nature of the activity that is the problem but the difference in reward which should as in tribal society be proportionate to the overall needs of society and its ability to pay.\nGrowing feudal and authoritarian societies encouraged further economic and social development because they allowed risk. They gave the power to change society and takes risks, to a king (or in some nations a queen) and abolished permanent tribal rules imposed and upheld collectively. The creation of economic surplus set humanity on the march towards modern politics and modern society but also created the inequality we still experience today.\nEarly and successful Middle East authoritarian systems were conquered by Islam. Some of these then adopted and developed mainly Greek science and other modern ideas of the day.\nWhilst Islam in the Middle East was able to conquer authoritarian systems, these sorts of economic systems were eventually willing to accommodate Christianity too.\nWith Christianity, authoritarian systems such as feudalism adopted a religion which was unconcerned with earthly power and so accepted the idea of inequality on earth. Whilst Islamic authoritarian societies were forced to accept economic inequality, within Islam itself economic inequality was haram or wrong. For some devout Muslims today, this remains a major cultural rubbing point with western economies and some Muslim states like Saudi Arabia. In Islamic law there are strict rules about profit and fairness.\nLike everywhere else in Europe, and parts of the Middle East, Britain was finally wealthy enough to develop feudalism after the Romans left in the fifth century. It became fully established after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Its decline began after the Black Death in the fourteenth century when a shortage of labour forced wages up and drove economic innovation.\nIn Box\nFeudalism was the theft of resources from the many by a small elite who set up power structures to maintain their authority. The ‘right’ to do this was at odds with tribal values but elite politics won the day. Britain developed feudalism after the Romans left in the fifth century.\nChapter three\nNothing lasts forever. Feudalisms decline and the rise of capitalists power. The action moves to Europe.\nIn Europe Feudalism endured for centuries and in various forms it still exists today in parts of the world that are not yet industrial but are no longer tribal. Its main characteristic is still its top-down, unaccountable authoritarianism.\nIn Britain we consider ourselves beyond feudalism, but traces of it appear in ceremonial form in ours and many other modern European States. These states maintain power based on status/property/income and have as a ‘democracy’ a system based on the representation of the people by an elected as opposed to hereditary elite. This is promoted by politicians and generally accepted by the people as the acceptable antidote to past unaccountable feudal power and authoritarianism.\nBritain remains in some senses feudal with democracy grafted on, because we now elect and pay our elite. We are still subject to their rules and decisions, however much we disagree with them. Disagreement between the people and our elected elite seems to be getting more common as they no longer seem to ‘represent’ the people who pay them. Us!\nIn Britain, feudalism’s decline began due to increasing levels of prosperity generated by education, science, further agricultural advances, and the work of an intelligent emerging ‘middle class’. This change began to develop after the ravages of the Black Death in the fourteenth century when labour was in short supply and wages were going up.\nThe earliest challenge to the British feudal system came about because ordinary working people were trading and by their combined efforts and expertise were creating greater wealth than had been previously possible. The feudal aristocracy who ‘owned’ all wealth were, therefore, getting rich at the expense of ordinary hard-working people. The aristocracy was also wasting wealth on wars and personal vanity.\nKings who at one time broke society away from predictable tribal society were no longer promoting economic and social evolution but were holding back changes demanded by a working middle class who were not benefitting politically from their skill and enterprise.\nThis middle class made up of innovators, merchants and hard-working ‘entrepreneurs’ was getting restless, angry and their workforce hungry. There were riots in England from the fourteenth century onwards due to food shortages and abuses of feudal power.\nIn Germany, ideas were developing based on religious scripture that supported a new economic model based on hard work that challenged the idea that the church was entitled to the economic wealth created by ordinary people. These ideas also challenged the role of the church in supporting the poor.\nAs with the change from tribal society to top-down authoritarian power like feudalism, the reality of different groups of people was again coming into conflict. This gave rise to revolution. The final stage of this economic revolution began in Britain in the seventeenth century, France in the eighteenth century and wider Europe in the nineteenth century and Russia and China in the twentieth century.\nThese revolutions put capitalist ideas into what had become declining feudal societies. These revolutions broke the power of those born to rule and replaced it with power based on the economic or political interests of a new elite. The elites were landowners and capitalists and their group interests became political Parties. Much later ‘workers’ gained their own parties too.\nBy freeing people from feudalism and reforming religion so people had to work hard for wages or make a profit rather than live on ‘welfare’ from the Church, capitalism promoted the world of the economic rather than the religious or feudal elite. Capitalism like feudalism still relied on surplus value being created, but under capitalism it was created by workers free to contract with capitalists for work. The surplus value was then acquired by capitalists in the form of profit. To succeed as an economic model capitalism needed people to be free to think, speak, innovate and trade. The legal principles of contract, choice and consent were the basis of capitalist economics, not as had been the case under feudalism: compulsion, coercion and control.\nCapitalisms values of contract, choice and consent have been and continue to be liberating for working people, which is something that many left-wing politicians struggled to accept. Before capitalism, as we have seen, the aristocracy controlled the nation’s wealth. It was revolutions that had to be used to dislodge them.\nIn Russia and China, one form of feudalism with kings was replaced by revolutionary socialism: a system based on control of the economy by one political party that believed it represent the working class. Any one-party state is called totalitarian. Revolutionary Russia and China therefore did not become capitalist instead they fused their one-party political system with industrialisation. This undermined the workers who, whilst still creating surplus value (as in capitalism proper), were subordinate to the one-party state.\nAll ‘modern’ political systems all over the world including within western democracy promote the importance of the political party, but in ‘democracy’ there is a choice of parties to support.\nIn the west, capitalism did liberate innovators, workers and people of science from what had become the menace of the European feudal system. Once the scientist and innovators had ‘industrialised’ there was no holding back this engine of economic and social progress. A combination of people and machines created more surplus value than the world had ever known.\nThe British Empire was financed by capitalism. Like all empires, it had many moral failings. Eventually it was based on trade, freedom within the law and the accumulation of capital (surplus value turned into property, wealth and bankable money). Whilst based on trade, it was still skewed in favour of the capitalist economic elite. By the eighteenth century, it was fully exploitative of the nations it had conquered but to function properly it was able to leave a legacy in some ex colonies of contract, choice and consent and British common law.\nSocieties that could not innovate within the capitalist model due to religious observance, for example, created growing poverty for their subject peoples. As a result, Islam’s Eastern empire had disappeared by 1928. Islam is now re-emerging as a moral force across the globe funded by Saudi oil money.\nWhilst capitalism as a system did not discriminate, it impacted harder on poorer, predominantly black or religious majority nations who have historically been unable to build up the capital or wealth necessary to be part of the capitalist system. Today many poor countries have authoritarian heads of State who don’t believe in liberating their people using freedom based on contract, choice and consent.\nBy creating so much wealth industrial capitalism was widely viewed as a force for prosperity and liberation, particularly for those middle-class owners of capital who maintained the system. They disguised its unfairness with religion, parliamentary democracy and the law. This is what is known as right-wing thinking; promoting the interests of capitalism.\nHowever, capitalism was experienced as very unfair by the workers or as they were called then the ‘working class’ They knew they worked hard to create the surplus value necessary to make others very wealthy.\nFrom the nineteenth century onwards, within western democracies industrial capitalism reigned supreme until the turn of the twentieth century. But industrial capitalism was a system that had in built ‘contradictions’ such as too few winners and too many losers, so over time legislation and taxation had to be used to minimise the bad impact of capitalism on the working class.\nCapitalists wealth came and went often within families and usually over several generations and when capitalists failed the capitalist system took workers down too, leading to unemployment.\nWhilst capitalism might have been ‘just’ because anyone, man or woman of any ethnic background could in theory become a capitalist by employing workers and accumulating wealth, it was unfair because it exploited the workers (exploited means making them work harder for their wages, so they created surplus value or profit for the capitalist). The unfairness of the capitalist system created ‘left wing’ thinking.\nIn Box\nCapitalism took over old feudal systems and created a form of democracy that promoted the interests of its wealthy capitalist elite. Workers were ‘free’ but had to contract for employment and were exploited by capitalists. The unfairness of this economic arrangement gave rise to left wing political ideas.\nChapter Four\nChange again: Socialism. The rise of the left wing political elite.\nSo, in summary by the late nineteenth century, the UK, USA and Europe were capitalist countries, using representative ‘democracy’ to legitimise the capitalist systems so called ‘exploitation’ of workers.\nIt is at this point we meet socialism for the first time. There exist two kinds of socialism. Democratic socialism is not to be confused with revolutionary or single party-based socialism (like early twentieth century Soviet Russia, China or Nazi Germany).\nWhilst capitalism was based on contract and choice e.g. a worker had ‘choice’ of who to work for, it also meant working people toiled on low wages and in poor conditions to make a few people rich. The rich were rich because they employed millions of people and took the surplus value those people created banking it as their own.\nAs workers became more educated and organised (both expected within a ‘progressive’ capitalist system) they began to see the unfairness in what was happening and how the whole religious, political and legal system justified their exploitation, holding them back economically.\nLeft wing socialist ideas started to be promoted by an educated working and politically ambitious ‘middle class’. At first, they demanded capitalist industrialisation should be destroyed by violent revolution and replaced with socialist industrialisation. This was revolutionary socialism. It took hold as we have seen only in places like twentieth century Russia, China and North Korea\nConcerned about possible revolution, democratic governments who wanted to improve capitalism used taxation to support those who fell out of the system and into unemployment. They also restricted the capitalist’s ability to take advantage of their workers.\nIn the free western world, over time, governments improved workers conditions and introduced clean air, education, housing and employment rights. Much of this is what revolutionary socialists had demanded. Similarly, rights like the right to vote or stand for parliament, rights that only capitalists enjoyed in the eighteenth century were extended to more and more people. It started with working-class men in the nineteenth century and then women in the twentieth.\nThis use of laws to support workers was the beginning of socialist ideas. Most would agree that this was the elite doing good. Revolutionary socialists disagreed they wanted economies taken over and run by socialist parties.\nIn the early twentieth century Russia and China experienced the revolutionary socialist elite taking control of the economy. For many decades after World War Two, this form of socialist state industrialisation became a political-bogeyman which western leaders called ‘communism’.\nFor working people in so called communist countries, the reality of industrial work was little different from the west. But with more freedom and innovation the west was more profitable and could offer a better lifestyle to its workers than communism, particularly in the USA.\nAll economic systems apart from tribal ones, need surplus value/profit to invest in maintaining the economy/society. Revolutionary socialist Russia never created enough surplus value/profit to pay for its bloated industrially inefficient state. Russia’s socialist experiment ended in the 1980’s. Arguably the EU is a similar bloated system today.\nFrom the end of the second world war British capitalism was viewed as an economic model that had too many problems such as poverty amongst the working class, to be allowed to continue without some state involvement. Various means of re distributing wealth were introduced by the post war democratic Labour Party. These ranged from public ownership of some industries like Coal mining, Ship building and Railways (Nationalisation) to tax changes that put a high burden on the rich.\nThe welfare state and National Health Service also came into existence. It was also seen as desirable to control the economy by pumping in money when it began to stop employing people because demand for what they had produced was low and they were unemployed.\nWith a growing need for so much state control, the elite became ‘experts’ trained to manage the economy and society. The elite were now just as likely to be state employees like civil servants as capitalists. The term used at this time was the ‘mixed economy’. It was capitalism controlled by socialist ideas.\nIn Box\nCapitalism was unfair to workers so ‘socialist’ ideas developed in Britain. After the second world war ‘democratic socialism’ regulated Britain’s economy. The idea behind democratic socialism is to take wealth off capitalists, wealth which workers have created and spend it on state provision like health care or welfare.\nChapter Five\nGovernment ‘experts’ and politicians become the new elite. Debt to the rescue!\nThe changes introduced by the socialist British Labour government after the Second World War led to a period of sustained prosperity. Inefficiency set in from about 1970 onwards. At this point the tax payer began paying for the nationalised industries that could not pay for themselves.\nBecause of changes in the global economy that have taken place since the 1980s capitalism in the west has had to evolve into what we now call the ‘free market’.\nA free market is exactly what it says it is. Anyone can, in theory, become a producer or consumer. A process helped by the internet with ‘You Tubers’ making millions in sponsorship. People can produce almost anything and consume almost anything.\nThe free market relies on economic relationships which are negotiated by a global economic elite who, depending on how you see the free market, have either a monopoly over how this free market works or have no control over it what so ever. Those who influence the free market are amongst others the Multi-National companies, tech giants as well as national governments including the EU and global trade organisations.\nThe free market, unlike eighteen and nineteenth-century capitalism, is not concerned with personal morality it only needs ‘consumers’ with enough income to buy products. So, thanks to the free market’s need to have consumers, ‘lifestyles’ previously discriminated against by religious or cultural prejudice can be accommodated by economic freedom and the acceptance, for the time being, of the western political elite.\nTo enhance consumer choice some western businesses have sent their production to developing countries to save money on worker’s wages and thus maximise profit on their popular retail brands. This makes people in a few companies very rich but reduces the number of wage earners and taxpayers employed in the west.\nBecause of the way the free market operates it is seen by many as not just unfair but immoral. The free market is not capitalism. It is not an economic system based on a set of unfair but coherent economic principles reinforced by religion, politics and the law. It is essentially a global economic free-for-all. A religion of personal self-interest, desire and choice.\nThe free market has progressed around the world spreading the same values that gave rise to freedom in Britain, the United States and Europe, but in these economies its wealth-creating capacity has become weaker. So, to support its profitability money must be pumped into the economy by governments. Money based on debt and taxation.\nTo complicate things further, profit made by big western corporations is often taxed ‘offshore’ and therefore doesn’t contribute taxation to help pay for state the state bureaucracy we have inherited since the second world war. The government must therefore borrow money to pay for the services it provides. Services which many of us use.\nThe result is that powerful western elites and their parliaments, political systems and bureaucracies who in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries would have been paid for by capitalisms tax payments are now relying ordinary workers to pay for them via income tax and indebtedness. Workers are therefore sacrificing their power to consume, to pay for the state and government.\nAs we have said the ‘free market’ is a consumer market, therefore, the next revolution has its basis in spending power. It’s here we find the free market’s major problem. Expensive western governments reduce the ability of workers to consume. But to remain ‘free’ with values promoting personal freedom under pinning it, the free market needs consumers.\nNew consumers are also needed beyond the economically troubled European and American economies. Brexit should be about creating a greater global economic fairness by spreading consumer equality via spending power beyond the so called ‘rich’ but indebted nations of the west.\nIn addition to tax reducing consumer spending, consumer spending is worsened because the big corporations sit on mountains of profit and don’t put it back into the world economy as ‘spending power’ via wages. This economic model is unsustainable.\nIn Box\nWhat was left of capitalism finally stopped working in the 1980’s. It became the market financed by debt and managed by global experts. It needs consumers, but governments take money from consumers. The global elite are making us pay for them and this limits our consumer spending. The free market protects our rights but is now debt dependent.\nChapter Six\nWhat future the free market as the elite go global. Power for the few, debt for the many.\nGovernments need money just as individuals do and the money needed is no longer available through the profitability of western capitalism. Today our state with its big employment bill relies on debt and tax to pay its way on our behalf.\nNo one questions the need for state employment (Dr’s, nurses, social workers, police etc) but the cost of paying the elite that manages them is no longer justified due to the nation’s lack of profitability and reliance on debt.\nIf free of the burden of too much government debt and tax the ordinary worker can become a more effective consumer, spending more of what they earn to enable other workers to be employed locally in businesses, shops, coffee houses and bars or in caring for their local community at large.\nAbove a certain wage level, payments do not add directly to local consumer spending but end up in the global economy. The power base of our wealthy political and economic elite.\nTo add to consumers woes much of our private debt which we are encouraged to take out to help with consumer demand, needs to be underpinned by some form of value. This value comes from land or property. In the case of land, an increase in land value works its way through the financial system as people raise money by mortgages. This gives us a contribution to national income based on asset value-based debt. This is what led to the 2007-2008 banking crisis when loans to customers were backed by land values and land values went down.\nBy basing much of a nation’s ability to pay its way on debt we are slowly gobbling up our food production capacity by selling land for debt backed development etc. This model provides well-paid work to service sector employees like bankers/lawyers/estate agents and land managers. It also provides taxation on profits for the state. Big corporations benefit too as tax income plus government debt pays for contracts to do work in NHS/defence/education and criminal justice or indeed build roads. All political parties in the UK must uncritically endorse this value backed debt model. What is the alternative?\nMore seriously, with all our debt we are slowly eroding the long-term viability of our planet as we in the west over consume its natural resources. The debt based free market system is damaging the planet to a far greater extent than any system before it. However, it has extended people’s rights and ended illegitimate abuse of those held back economically by low status or discrimination under earlier capitalist, feudal/authoritarian and tribal systems. As a culture our attitude to the free market is therefore ambiguous.\nSome people believe the moral confusion of the free market requires a return to ‘faith’, Christian or Islamic. Others believe in taking whole national economies under government control.\nA modern free market economy only works when people have almost complete economic freedom without fear or sanction. With state ownership, we might have jobs, but we give our economic freedom to the state and compromise our right to contract, choose and consent as we, rather than the state sees fit.\nTo see the impact of religion on a society look at Iran or Saudi Arabia. People crying out for the economic and social equality offered by the free-market, particularly women and the gay community. Lack of freedom affects prosperity and peoples happiness. It causes anger by supressing freedom and makes states oppressive.\nReligion and traditional democratic socialism, therefore, fail the freedom for the worker test. They are solutions to a looming economic and ecological crisis that simply can’t reflect the expectations of a modern workforce enjoying lives based on choice, consent, freedom and limited democracy.\nBlue Revolution is based on what is called ‘economic determinism’ or economic reality. In other words, the reality of working people. What working people experience should be instinctively more important than the views of people at the ‘top’ with their unconscious ‘global’ self-interest.\nIdeas to improve society must come from the economic experience of working people and not from various political party conferences where policy is created by party members (a tiny minority of the people) then imposed on society (all the people) when parties get into government.\nTo preserve freedom ordinary people must now set the political and economic agenda just as the middle-class capitalist did in the eighteenth century. Political parties products of the eighteenth century have no significant role in influencing this process.\nPeople should take more control in politics because having fought for the right to choose and consent and having gained our freedom and our limited democracy, it now seems like political parties and a global elite both paid for by our debt and taxes are taking our rights away and imposing their ‘global ideology’ on us. An ideology that accepts the abuse of people elsewhere in the world whilst undermining western national identities and the hard fought for rights that go with those national identities.\nIn Britain we need to reform our political system so for the first time ever it becomes a system that protects western values and our belief in the principles of choice and consent, freedom and democracy. Working western people would preserve and extend these rights to all the world’s working people. Every other class or powerful group restricts them as they always have done to preserve their power.\nLook around you, most people you see would support all your freedoms unquestioningly as you would support theirs.\nIn Box\nThe free market creates our rights to choose and consent, but it relies on an economy which is dependent on debt. We need to preserve our free market to ensure we preserve our rights as working people because in much of the world people have few rights. If the debt dependent free market disappears our rights will go with it.\nChapter seven\nAnd finally, people power? Another Revolution where the people replace the elite!\nWe have been through this brief history of wealth and public power otherwise known as politics, explaining how working people have created wealth but have not held the power that wealth should grant. In the twentieth century the left wing had believed it was working in the interests of the people but once they had the power of the ‘state’ behind them they undermined economic rights with policies which increase the expense of the state, at a direct financial/social cost to the taxpayer.\nGovernments need to recognise that far from being an asset to the British economy, they are a pitiful hinderance to it by taking too much money in tax to pay for bits of their system that we no longer need, like their hierarchy and power structures in politics and in the public sector.\nState costs reduce peoples spending power. Spending power is needed to preserve our free market economy and therefore our choice-based lifestyle.\nSo, what can we the nation’s working people do today to protect ourselves? Ordinary working people did not bring down feudalism (it was the capitalists that did that) and we did not bring down capitalism (it has been saved by corporate global economics and as the free market it is financed and threatened by debt). The next revolution is our revolution and we can’t afford to mess it up. Yet most people don’t even realise a revolution is needed.\nSome things to consider\nFirstly, Blue Revolution doesn’t need to have all the answers. We do not want to be like a political party promoting policy and selecting candidates in-house. We are simply a political ‘Brand’ anyone can use should they wish to.\nWe suggest that political policy must not be developed and implemented by a party elite. The most grotesque examples might be the Blair/Bush war on Iraq or the creeping power-based unification of the EU, but there are lots more examples besides, like the creation of the police and crime commissioners or The High-Speed Rail link (HS2) These policies never had the peoples approval.\nUnder our eighteenth-century parliaments political policies generally have nothing to do with the views of real working people. We, therefore, need to change the political system to make working people’s views more relevant. We need to stop our elite 650 British MP’s using their party’s membership to manipulate democracy in favour of their special interests, be those interests bankers, house builders, Trades Union Barons or militant identity groups.\nBlue Revolution believes the only solution is to extend to the lowest legitimate political level, for example to parish councils, the power to contribute to debate and vote on national policy. Voting using technology would be very quick. A debate would be more interesting too, with a level of engagement that would be massive. It would be set up to ensure that where necessary every contributor had knowledge of their subject.\nThe effect would be that the elite Westminster bubble would burst because a parish councillor may advance the best challenge to an idea from a remote village in some-where-shire. The government would still be drawn from the largest group in Westminster but the people who debate their proposals and vote would come from a group of people considerably larger than the current 650 ‘handpicked’ party political MP’s.\nThe role of religion needs to be addressed too as traditional moral views are being promoted within a newly confident Islam. This poses a risk to equality in a way not seen since the seventeenth century. Religion has always been used by elites or those who would like to become elites. It does their mind controlling for them by promoting ‘spiritual’ compliance within the elite sanctioned faith.\nTo deal with ancient moral systems we need to dismantle all state authorised religious teaching and recognise faith as a personal choice that reflects a person’s spirituality but does not extend beyond that into the realm of politics or public life. Religion takes advantage of peoples innate spirituality and turns it into something that supports a political ideology. There should be no obligation on the nation or her people to accept any religion.\nToday we see the consequences of religious morality as it violates twenty-first-century human rights, rights extended over centuries by progressive economic and social development in the west. This fact is lost on our culturally illiterate European elite who protect all religion, irrespective of that religion’s commitment to preserving the rights of the individual.\nIn addition to managing religious influence maybe working people should not have their opinions ‘informed’ by an over promoted media elite working to maintain a failing party based parliamentary political system.\nThe news department of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) should avoid bias and become a limited ‘public service’ news department paid for as now by taxation or licence fee, but which provides fact-based news or the attributable opinion of a wide variety of informed people. This would mean that the BBC or its employees would not be allowed to express their own opinions on air.\nWith News coverage based on facts and the shared reality of working people, workers could shape policy and make politics truly dynamic operating in the interests of the economy and working people and not the state or any elite.\nFinally, unless change takes place the western economy will in the words of Karl Marx collapse under the weight of its economic contradictions. Today the most troubling contradiction is western government debt being used to enable consumers to buy goods made abroad. This does not generate sustainability for western workers or the free market system upon which people’s rights are dependent.\nReliance on this system will bankrupt the government first and then, the nation itself. Moreover, western companies like Amazon diminish jobs in retail and sit on a mountain of profit which doesn’t become via wages, more consumer spending. You can’t run an economy on this basis. It will eventually collapse. And then what? Religious authoritarianism, political totalitarianism, both?\nPlease support a Blue Revolution simply by thinking aloud and differently about your life and your needs. Think about your values and where your values and ideas come from and how you could become more outspoken to protect those values from the many challenges faced by working people in the twenty-first century.\nIf you want to you can donate even a very small amount to our group by going on our website ABlueRevoluton.Org.\nBetter still stand as an independently thinking and voting candidate for the independent brand Blue Revolution (read our website for details of how). You are totally free to promote your own political beliefs with Blue Revolution. We are not like other parties we have no bureaucracy and simply endorse you as a candidate if you share our values. You will be the people’s choice!\nAlternatively, just contribute to the debate in your own way.\nRemember peoples personal freedom is shaped by their economic and social life experiences and these are now under threat because we have a near-bankrupt western free market. We need to start the discussion. We can’t trust the elite anymore……if we ever could.\nThank you for reading.",

The Deputy Chairman commented that 2018-19 had been disappointing in respect of developing a local media profile. This was a result of the failure to develop opportunities offered by local facebook sites. A Twitter account called Boston Resident 2 was set up in 2018 and Richard was hoping to develop this. We now have a by-election under our belt. This was fought in February 2018. We ran Richard as a paper candidate and delivered leaflets to about half the Ward. The Conservatives won the by-election with about 70% of the turnout. Regrettably, the treasurer Darron Abbot resigned due to the Monitoring Officer having a meeting with a sitting councillor and member of the Boston Independent Group.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-mess-of-globalisation-and-the-collusion-of-the-left-our-take-on-it/content_157.html": "The “mess” of “globalisation” and the collusion of the “left”. Our take on it!\nIt seems completely crazy but at some point in the last forty years, the global elite decided that with collapsing capitalism at home the future was “engineered” (as opposed to organic) “global” capitalism. Not a global capitalism which brought countries into the “freedom family” of trading nations based on contract, choice and consent, but a global capitalism “gamed” in the interests of failing western economies.\nThis programme promoted by amongst others Bush, Blair and Clinton has failed spectacularly and has resulted in failed states, failing economies, mass migration and the relentless reduction in western workers real incomes and freedom.\nIt all started just after Ronald Regan left office (or so we say!). A Republican running a massive budget deficit was a symptom of a crisis in the US economy. American capitalism was on its knees and no one seemed able to rescue it. The only option was to go global. To ensure the primacy of the west in this new global reality it had to be gamed promoting the interests of the west above all others.\nThis global system being manipulated by the corporate/political elite ensured western economic superiority. The problem was that to maintain this broken system debt has replaced profitability. Workers and governments of the west have had to maintain this system, finding themselves promoting the interests of a global super-elite at their own financial expense. We call this process debtamorphosis.\nThis debt based model hit the buffers in 2007 and will do again as nothing has changed. The “Left” trill that “austerity” is damaging the economy. They are the useful idiots of the global elite. They are exactly what the global elite want. People prepared to pump taxpayers debt into their global system to keep them rich. We call this western model Secular-Westernism.\nIn addition to getting greater indebtedness to maintain demand in the western economy, the elite and political “Hawks”, realised there was a need to get cash into the failing western worlds coffers as well. They started to embark on a democratisation project that would “help” to rid nations of their tyrants like Saddam in Iraq, None of this met the test of “justice” it couldn’t it wasn’t based on Contract, Choice and Consent. It was imposed by force. Tony Blair still believes it was a “just” war. But “justice” in capitalism means contracted and consented to, not forced. The west in this way was acting like a feudal tyrant.\nWe believe they accepted that there would be collateral damage but reconstruction contracts would assist in the rebuilding of these new democracies, helping western nations financially. Like everything you can write on the back of a fag packet, this project failed spectacularly.\nIt failed because the values of contract, choice and consent needed in a democracy are products only of a capitalist system, itself a product of scientific and rational thinking. No other type of economy creates an understanding and a willing application of these principles of contract, choice and consent. That is why they are alien values in feudal, tribal and many Islamic countries.\nSo having bombed Iraq the western “Hawks” expected a grateful nation to welcome freedom, women’s rights, a free press, self-restraint, toleration of difference etc. Er no. If you understood the rudiments of Marx’s political economics it would have been clear that all that would happen is what has happened, these nations, now broken, have reverted to tribal and sectarian infighting. The rights of women, gay people and Jewish people, Christians and other foreign nationals have been ripped asunder. It’s wasn’t supposed to be like that but that is precisely how it is. There is also mass migration on a continental scale to deal with. This issue is one that is seemingly without an easy solution.\nLike the countries from which the migrants come there is no rich heritage of contract, choice and consent, so their economic and therefore cultural reference points are from a period Karl Marx and Frederick Engles called “barbarism”. In modern terms, very many are sexist, racist, homophobic and violent, because that was what it had to be like in traditional pre-feudal economies. The individual faithful can’t be blamed any more than you can blame a westerner for wanting to be a millionaire. Values are economic as well as culturally determined! What however one can say is this. Having introduced people who have values unlike our own how are you going to assimilate them? They will typically not want to assimilate preferring to group with those with whom they share values in common.\nTo cover their tracks and avoid blame for what has been done to so many western nations, the global elite seems to have the unexpected help of the “hard left” who assist by aggressively shutting down the views of working people with shrill cries of racism, or Islamophobia. For politics supposedly based on Marx’s scientific socialism, these hard left groups are too prone to “differentiate” the working population and are too ready to accept pre-capitalist values.\nSo, in conclusion, in addition to western workers jobs going east and debt replacing profitability, we have illegal and immoral adventurism on the part of a western economic elite. Seeing that western capitalism was failing, these people developed a strategy of “war reconstruction and democracy building”. This strategy has failed and has led to mass migration. We also have various iterations of a left-wing keen to build a “proletarian army” from a differentiated collection of people with identity issues and this, in the case of shouts of “Islamism”, is being used to silence working peoples natural objection to what has happened to their countries. Kleptocrats and the hard left both on the same page? You really couldn’t make it up.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_we-examine-the-four-markets-of-the-apocalypse-2/content_203.html": "We examine the “four markets of the apocalypse”!\nJust like the four horsemen of the Apocalypse bring war, famine, conquest and death so we believe that there are now four markets of the apocalypse that will signal the end of the West’s global preeminence and with that usher in an era of well, famine, war conquest and death! Many will argue that the “global system” has created wealth in abundance and staved off starvation and numerous other miseries. However, we have wars raging in the Middle East and in the west, the poor are getting poorer and being blamed for it. So we will explore our four markets of the apocalypse and how they contribute to the world’s misery and death. They are in order of significance, for us they are, the global labour market, Bond markets, The financial market, and the housing market.\nThe working classes have forever been victims of a failing system. From peasants locked into servitude then thrown into urban factories in the 18th and 19th centuries to the workers who, thrown into unemployment were salvaged from destitution by two world wars. More recently the stupifying horror of “healthcare and welfare” as capitalism gave way to the racketeering of the “free market”. What underpins all of these scenarios is labour market failure. However whilst the more obvious iterations of labour market failure are easy to see, we have sleepwalked through the most recent failure believing all is Ok.\nIt all began in the late 1970’s when capitalism finally got to the point where it was producing too little value to support the social and political institutions it had supported since the 18th century. Institutions like the law, politics and local government, health and welfare. Capitalism was on the ropes and whether by intention or accident the labour market was seen as a major cause of the failure. The solution was overseen by passive and ignorant political class who watched firstly the shift of higher value production to China and the re-emergence of the western economy as a “consumer” economy and finally the remaining “onshore” low-value work taken by migrants from Mexico or Eastern Europe. An economy that consumes but does not produce value isn’t an economy at all…unless it’s a kind of Alice in Wonderland economy.\nThe combined effects of this crazy business model has been to turn UK workers into welfare and healthcare “paupers” unwanted by the global labour market but growing fat and docile at the State’s or rather taxpayers expense. In the US the businessmen and women get rich whilst the poor are not pauperised but ghettoised and become that useful social commodity a criminal. In the UK many unemployed are hidden by a therapeutic language of “needs” and inadequacy taking them out of the labour market altogether.\nPeople, of course, do work but most private sector workers are in the “consumer” economy as shop, restaurant and hotel workers or the building industry. These workers rely on the other failing markets the housing, financial and Bond market to boost the economy in their sector, largely via debt.\nThe labour market has rendered British an US workers unemployable, created a docile underclass of ex-industrial and agricultural workers and their second and third generation offspring, whilst low production costs and “western” production values have made retail billionaires out of a whole unlovable bevvy of spivs and chancers. All this whilst the politicians have stood around in a kind of baffled paralysis and simply watched. In the US and the UK no one really “gets it” apart from the people getting rich from this crazy economic and social model. It makes publicly funded “chiefs” wealthy beyond their dreams, along with a whole swathe of what we call the publicsectoracy or the new taxpayer-funded elite. The workers currently have zombie jobs and low pay. Eventually with no jobs and no pay who knows what will happen.\nThe modern labour market has failed and is failing every time someone goes to work in the west and is paid with the proceeds of debt. When it finally crashes (because of the failure of our other markets) the crisis will render most westerners economically redundant with little economic or social value. This will usher in a feudal-like system run by the caring right and the psychotic left. Back to the future indeed.\nWhilst the labour market has failed in response to the latest iteration of the failure of western capitalism, governments or rather the State had to undertake business as usual and that meant paying themselves and their retinue wages initially set at the benchmark of what the capitalist or bourgeois system would tolerate. Now, however, shorn of the need to concern themselves with actual money taken from rich bourgeois taxpayers who had political clout the state borrows by issuing Bonds and defers the cost of running the State to the next generation. The baby boomers are really looking after themselves as only the 1960’s and 1970’s entitled generation know how to. Corbyn and a youthquake….get real! He is looking after the boomers first and foremost.\nThe problem with Bonds, like much else we call economics, is that they are debt and debt isn’t repaid or serviced by the state but by taxpayers and taxpayers who are in the long-term often not even born when the Bond is issued. Just as the working classes were sailed down the river by the politicians’ stewardship of the labour market the same is now going on with Bonds. A brief history of the Bond illustrates the point. Bonds were first issued in the 18th century to pay for military excursions and wars. In normal times the economy paid for the State but to prosecute war the State borrowed from the economy. Today the State buys breakfast with Bonds…..and that is good for no one and certainly not the working classes who, already on the road to pauperdom, will be paying for the State elite’s breakfasts for years to come. This market will fail, interest rates and inflation will once normal economics returns turn British and US Bonds into junk. The State won’t be able to borrow. How will the elite cope….? At the expense of the unemployed workers, of course. Ex-workers newly pauperised and docile, obsessed with identity and social media the new elite will simply take control. “fake news” is part of that process, it makes people trust their elite and not trust themselves.\nThe financial market is interesting. Back in the days of proper (albeit conflicted and exploitative) capitalism, the financial markets served the capitalist economy…Bankers were to coin a phrase petit bourgeois. The bankers served the interests of “capital”, capital owned by “capitalists”. The growth in the economy was driven by the profitability of the capitalist system, banking and the other bourgeois institutions like the law and parliament served the needs of the capitalist. However, we have explained that capitalism has failed having died sometime in the 1970’s and in its death throes it was unable to meet the demands of the State that had become bloated on it’s back. This was one of those threshold moments when international relations deteriorate, groups are blamed for the systems failure and wars start. Unfortunately, in spite of Bush and Blairs attempt to open up a lucrative war or two in the Middle East, war is seen as too costly, counterproductive and more significantly expensive. Bonds are no longer issued for paying for war but welfare, healthcare and wages.\nIn the absence of a real economy after the 1980’s creating value from the combining of factors of production (Land, Labour and Capital) and with capitalism dead in the western waters and wars and reconstruction no longer an option there was an ideological hiatus. What was going to happen?….well what happened is what is happening now!\nThe financial sector….for to hundred years the Aunt Sally of the real capitalist system became the “economic system”, in the newly minted and newly branded free market. With the opportunity to offshore work to places like China and bring migrants in to do low-value jobs at home, low production costs and high production values created huge profits for the racketeers, whilst the drive towards home ownership shifted public value into the hands of the private individual who could then borrow secured loans as their asset, their home, rose in value. This was driven by more borrowing, migration, artificial demand from broken homes and students.\nThe financial sector has essentially “equity released” Great Britain to indebted Britons or wealthy global speculators. Whilst the banking system has many tentacles, for us the most lucrative is the property backed lending spree that has kept the low-cost high-profit free market going. The whole thing is fine until the asset values plunge and consumption or spending power shrinks. This will happen, it happened in 2007/8 and nothing has changed except governments are now even more indebted and technically bankrupt than they were after 2007/8.\nThe final market which as we have hinted at above feeds the financial market with “value” is the housing market. This market is unreconstructed and depends on the levels of supply being outstripped by levels of demand. Levels of demand are manipulated by a number of factors including selling the homeownership ideal but at a more practical level migration, divorce and family reconstruction, as well as student rentals all, add to demand. This demand inflates prices whilst builders “Feed in” just enough property so as to ensure gentle inflation in the market creating “lending and borrowing opportunities” for the financial sector. This model of housing ignores some obvious flaws namely that housing should serve the needs of the economy, it can’t be a major part of the economy by providing the “value” base for secured lending.\nModern housing does not reflect the needs of the modern worker, it is based on the 1950’s mythical nuclear family. A home that has two or three bedrooms and costs £200,000 is not achievable nor for many modern workers desirable. The modern worker should be global, childless until a child is affordable, flexible and have accommodation which does not soak up a huge amount of earnings.The modern housing market is a Baby Boomer confection that is manipulated and engineered to produce monetary value to support the “free market”, the building industry and its CEO’s and the government.\nTo keep this important market going we need to inflate property prices, build on greenfield sites break up families and keep students and migrants driving people out of the town and city centres to the new out of town estates. This market will collapse and will take the financial market with it.\nThe four markets of the apocalypse are either failed but “zombied” like the labour or Bond markets or they are the great hope of the system but overvalued and indebted with high asset values feeding the consumer based economy. Looking at all four markets it is difficult to work out what to do. It’s like being in quicksand. don’t move or do move…..you are still going to drown!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-fire-in-london-shames-our-democracy/content_349.html": "The fire in London shames our democracy!\nIt is so sad that up to 100 people have been engulfed in fire.\nThe community affected is poor multiracial and multicultural and so has no voice. The council’s response betrays the typical reaction of a bureaucracy being defensive and camouflaging responsibility until stories have been straightened out. The lack of emotion from politicians suggests that they have finally mastered “disassociation” the psychological condition which renders ordinary people unworthy of concern or empathy. This is precisely the issue we at Blue Revolution have noted over the last seven years or so.\nPoliticians unavoidably represent the interests of their party and themselves. The party all too often reflects the interests of a lobby and special interest groups. The parliamentary system provides a framework for this disassociative process. Binary politics makes everyone prone to denounce opposition and makes every politician defensive and quick to condemn others or be condemned. This type of politics works when the binary system reflects the interests of two equally powerful interests groups but those interests (landowners, capitalist, or industrialised workers) no longer exist and whilst the system tries to reflect the needs of ordinary people, ordinary people are now too diverse so it can’t.\nBinary politics can’t deal with the complexity of the North Kensington community, it really does not and cannot connect with most of that community with its racial, cultural and class and age-related diverse dimensions. The tower block had been renovated but there was disquiet about the quality of the work by residents. Where were the champions standing up for the ordinary people? There were no champions, experts and politicians seem to have been unconcerned about the safety of the tower block and as for our old friend the judiciary is concerned, well who could afford to get them involved. It is the time the politicians stopped propping up their 18th century legal and political systems and an array of other expensive old institutions and started to listen to and empower ordinary people. Only then will people feel heard and safe and behave like active participants in the features of their lives that most affect them. This is the antidote to an obvious growing public anger.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-opportunity-cost-of-maintaining-the-existing-political-structures/content_329.html": "The opportunity cost of maintaining the existing political structures. V2\nAnyone who has studied economics knows that ‘opportunity cost’ is what you don’t get when you do something. The alternative so to speak. The opportunity cost of a car might be the foreign holiday you can’t have because you have the car. In politics we have reached a point where the left and right unite to maintain the existing political system and the opportunity cost is a democracy and a political system that can encompass all shades of British public opinion and manage it with fairness and transparency.\nThe reason for this is for us quite simple. Both left and right either don’t recognise that our 19th-century political system was based on an evolving class system which has now ceased to exist in any meaningful sense or they want to protect their own party based model. The party model was always based on power groups who managed as an elite and promoted vested interests. This went on right up to the 1940’s when the Labour party created a post-war political settlement which delivered much-needed welfare to the working classes. This 19th-century model has and always will swap power between two opposing parties and even the hard left would rather see this system continue rather than demand its reform. The best anyone can come up with is reform of the electoral system which will leave the power structures intact and protect the rights of the elites of left and right to govern us as they see fit. Along with them, you have the media also deploying the lazy journalism of the ‘reductive polarity’ so as to reflect the interests of their polarised parliamentary collaborators.\nIt’s incredible but the left wing really doesn’t get that the way power is delivered and managed in this parliamentary structure and the vested interests whether it is media, money or the Trades Unions that underpin the way power is delivered are holding back the social progress that they claim to want so much. It is baffling too, that the right wing says they want small government and lower taxes whilst continuing to promote as a model for 21st-century democracy an increasingly remote, expensive and unrepresentative political system. Some people might conclude from this we are anti-monarchy, we are not! The Monarch is the only part of this creaking 19th-century system that works and is seen to work by the people. It’s the parliamentary bit that needs change before it goes pop, or the people do!",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-05-05-15-to-07-09-15/content_95.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 05.05.15 to 07.09.15\n05.05.15 British Labour Candidates at Muslim segregated event; is there an issue here?\nWell for all the talk of “diversity” that took place during the period under “New Labour” the ability to mix it up as a celebration of diversity seems to have failed to reach certain elements within the Muslim community and certain rather silly Labour candidates. Here at Blue Revolution are full on advocates of diversity but also extend a critical eye when certain practices remain fixed or fetishized in the 21st century. So, what do we make of this segregated event? Well firstly if this faith group choose to exclude gender mixing that is up to them. A gentle way of showing that there is respect for both sexes and more importantly trust between them has been missed. What is particularly odd however is the attendance at this event of male Labour party candidates who by attending “uncritically” have reinforced and endorsed the idea that the sexes should be kept apart.\nAs we have said in the past all culture is about survival and faith forms the most -important part of culture; so, at some point in the past it was both rational and “normal” to separate the sexes. This would have had its origins in the obvious differential roles played by men and women in societies that struggled to create the value necessary to guarantee the future of the tribe or kingdom. The women’s social role would have precluded them from any economic or military role and so separation would have been an obvious reflection of this rational situation. However today we create value; social and economic by our ability to collaborate not differentiate. By attending this event the Labour candidates were endorsing a view of the world that is as far from “diversity” as it is possible to get; Clearly, they are not very bright.\nThe Blue Revolution, view is that there is no place for this kind of separation not just in the Uk….as Nigel Farage suggested but anywhere in the word. The world will not start to generate the real levels of social and economic value necessary for us to survive in the 21st century and beyond if we adopt the cultural practices of the past. Value both social and economic in the modern world needs equality and there is no place for reinforcing the notion of irrational difference. Our view is that the Labour MP’s should have explained this position and if their views were considered too “modern” they should have politely refused to attend. Clearly the group of men were not only economically and socially illiterate; they are no great fans of women either.\n10.05.15 Sin Number two: Objectification\nWe hear the word objectification used by some commentators specifically in respect of women; the ease with which men resort to treating women as objects to be ogled at treated not as people but as things. Pornography being the most obvious manifestation of this process. This is the standard version of objectification and as you would expect here at Blue Revolution we can understand the motivation for this and the upsetting consequences for the person on the receiving end. However, this Male objectifying of women is essentially a western problem as women are freer to be objectified as our concept of modesty has been largely abandoned by those who wish to abandon it.\nMankind has always sought out the most beautiful and strongest mates as they have the highest value. Wolf whistling and mild pornography are rather silly modern by-products of this process, essentially tolerable if one wants to promote and protect freedom; particularly women’s freedom. Whilst it is unacceptable even at its lowest level, it is largely harmless. Women of course also engage in objectifying men as any middle-aged bald man in a bar will attest when he has the temerity to speak to any young female. The “Mr Darcy” effect applies to attractive men too. Objectification at this level is pretty gender neutral.\nOf course, seeking out the best mate being a “timeless practice” intended to promote the survival of the fittest it will have manifestations and controls in many cultures that exist today. The most obvious examples are head and face veiling in which the woman is rendered unseen as anything other than an object defined only by gender. This happens to varying degrees. Objectified by the requirements of her culture; the aim to avoid the lustful glances of men with whom she is not allowed to have any contact, to protect her virtue and in some cultures her life. This objectification can cause some very mixed opinions in western culture, but few people see it as “objectification”; more an expression of cultural or faith-based difference, and therefore there are several opinions about how one should react to it. However, when woman is objectified in this way it denies the culture the freedom to be creative and to generate value via inter gender trust and co-operation and it reflects suspicion between the sexes that requires control by male hegemony.\nThe most prevalent of objectification is everywhere and is silent and unseen; it never announces itself; far from it is never acknowledged. It is the objectification we do to ourselves; be we pumped-up muscle-bound jocks or the naked girls pleading for trade in the windows of a brothel in Amsterdam or on “Babe Station”. It is the preening look at me way certain people make themselves look to attract others; making objects of themselves. They are playing on the fact that we have the timeless practice of seeking out beauty and strength and they want to be the one that picks up the accolade of being objectified as often and as frequently as possible but only with someone who is worthy enough to reflect the objectified value they see in themselves. For some people being objectified generates positive feelings and hence the craving to be it and receive it may continue beyond the point where a mate is chosen, and children born, and it probably contributes the most to jealousy and relationship problems. That is why it is my second most serious deadly sin. Pornography, sexual crime, child abuse war and discrimination also have their origins in Objectification as does the rush to punish harshly or publicly humiliate.\nHowever, it is the casual thoughtless objectifications that adversely affect western society the most at the social level. So much harm is done when people express their needs either by objectifying others, or objectifying themselves, and in numbers too large to avoid moral catastrophe. To survive a society needs stability and higher moral purpose. We at Blue Revolution often think that objectification is what in many relationships passes as love.\nTo avoid Objectifying people we need to learn to treat all people as subjects and accord them the status of people with moods, thoughts, intellect, and feelings rather than objects to be looked at and despised or admired. Objectification be it via cloaking in a shrouding garment or viewing as objects for titillation is unhelpful to spiritual growth and proper economic value growth and we should not do it to ourselves or others.\n19.05 15 Refugees are a problem of value versus wealth\nRefugees and desperate migrants are a sad spectacle crammed in boats and dragged from port to port in Indonesia or often drowning in the Mediterranean if they are not successful in making shore in Italy. The current solution is to hand wring and accept them into the countries they are trying to get to. This is the only solution to date but at Blue Revolution we believe we need to look at the causes as these may guide the solution. In Indonesia the cause is discrimination which is a social value limiting modern day travesty of natural justice. Value as we at Blue Revolution assert all the time, is that product which a person or state creates, and which is necessary to support and sustain its population. The more value created the wealthier the country. Value is manifest in two ways; social value which is how well people function together and how little economic value is consumed in achieving this. Social Value in democracies should be social stability based on Contract, Choice, Consent, Freedom Democracy for example. However, these often abused for selfish personal gain, so a lot of economic value is consumed “correcting” the undesirable outcomes, divorce, crime, delinquency for example. In some other cultures social value is based on rules, obedience, submission and harsh punishments from government down to the family unit. But to create what little value these countries can; stability has to be imposed as opposed to consented to.\nWith social value comes the context to create economic value and from this process we generate wealth. This can be created in the form of manufactured goods; produced as harvested food, or simply pumped out of the ground in the form of oil and gas.\nRefugees are a product of the host country, be it Libya or Minamar failing to create the stable social context with enough social value to enable individuals to create the economic value necessary to support the country and its population. This comes about due to war corruption and incompetence. The solution therefore is to help the countries in difficulty provide the basic stability necessary to enable people to begin the process of creating economic value and thereby create the incentive to stay where they are. Even if this arrangement is less than democratic, as long as it is contract and consent based the democracy can come later. The EU could do this as the EU is well placed by proximity to North Africa to offer a social and economic model which is a little short of democratic but which could offer countries like Libya some “scrutiny” and economic support and therefore the stability to begin unleashing the economic potential of its people.\nThe paradox of the refugee situation is of course the All-Faiths-and-None old chestnut of the relative lack of overall social value in the west (governments now operate where social value once held sway and what a mess it is under the glitz and gloss) and the tendency for refugees to travel to a so called wealthy country which has a social morality which shocks and alarms them and leads to alienation, suspicion and mistrust. In the west, in all honesty, economic value is much lower than the wealth created with it, this apparent wealth too, acts as a draw for migrants. If we want to help solve the migrant issue therefore, we must improve the levels of social value in the west whilst increasing the levels of economic value in the countries that lack it. Over to someone!\n23.05.15 Sin number three: prejudice\nPrejudice is a very simple concept to understand but achieves the status of a modern sin by virtue of its role promoting the previous two Sins; cruelty and objectification. Many of us have been guilty of casually cussing at groups; single mothers, foreign people living in our communities, people of different faiths to our faith, or people with no faith at all. Prejudice is looking through the person and not seeing the individual. It is a limited and narrow-minded way of understanding a group or having a conversation about different groups of people without acknowledging they have differences and individual elements of uniqueness including rights which they can exercise. However, when prejudice runs out of control in the hearts of people of faith and no faith it becomes a frightening phenomenon indeed. The whole phenomenon of Nazi Germany would have started with casual prejudice against Jewish people or Gay people and was corralled by the Nazi propaganda machine into a cruel and objectifying ideology that whipped up into mass support. The Nazi’s could not have made progress without population familiar with casual prejudice. In Great Britain there is a tendency to be prejudiced against individuals particularly Eastern Europeans and this is encouraged by some political parties. The issue of migration does not go away, but it is important that the debate is not driven by prejudice.\nToday we see casual prejudice everywhere; different religions harbour prejudice against their faith “rivals”; ISIS have a whole creed built on prejudice; they however have, like the Nazis weaponized their prejudice and given the availability of money to support them they are able to turn prejudice into a cruel and barbaric ideology. We must all be on our guard for prejudice in our own treatment of people and our thoughts about them. That said there are debates to be had about important issues such as migration; radicalisation; western culture, welfare etc, however we don’t have to treat individual people who may share some of these characteristics as an exemplar of our particular issue and be prejudiced against them for it. Because prejudice feeds objectification and cruelty it is my third modern deadly sin.\n31.05.15 Hot Feminist- a view from Blue Revolution\nWe have recently been made aware of a book called “Hot Feminist” written we guess by a self-declared “hot feminist”. The redeeming characteristic of this book is that it encourages women to be loyal to one another and not engage in the kind of woman on woman character assassination that so many women tell us blights their lives; and this is particularly so in respect of insecure and vulnerable younger girls. However, with that bit of positive woo out of the way what are we to make of a book that tells women to ignore the “rules” of feminism and embrace sexiness and self-promotion.\nHaving only recently written about the corrosive effects of objectification we were amazed to find that here was a book promoting our second most deadly modern sin. Sexiness is important to men and to women; it is the way we attract a mate so that we can move from the sphere of singledom and its limiting social and economic value creation to the realm of coupledom with the possible expectation that our roles will be merged or will morph to allow us to bring a child or two into the world; a secure world of certainty and the absence of unnecessary contingency and risk. What the “Hot Feminist” advocates however is a form of self-objectified narcissism. The “old feminists” with their tribal rules warned against the objectification of women by men….and rightly so. The modern “Hot Feminist” wants to get in first; objectify herself and be the sexy one in the workplace as well as the bedroom. How exactly we ask can this total act of self-absorption assist society in its job of bringing up well balanced children and particularly girls. “Hot feminists” will almost certainly wish to attract otherwise committed men and potentially undermine the family (not intentionally perhaps but by default). Alternatively, they will tire of the man who doesn’t salivate whenever they purr into the room. They will make other women jealous and angry and even more importantly they will set themselves a very high bench mark for their own psychological gratification which will be fine as long as they are young and attractive or in respect of the many relationships being “Hot” is likely to lead to, compliant with the demands of the men they seek to be involved with and whose role is to reinforce their self-perception as “Hot”. As they get older dissatisfaction with life and looks will set in (it does for us all) and may possibly lead to depression and loneliness as well as Botox and plastic surgery for those who can afford it. Such nonsense as the “Hot Feminist” peddles undermines the most impressionable women in their longer term by filling their heads with rubbish in the short term and has no place in a society which desperately needs to address a shortage of solid social values (loyalty, modesty, chastity, selfrestraint even politeness etc) if it is ever going to stop wasting hard borrowed economic value to pay for government initiatives in health and welfare that plaster over the social cracks that make modern society lonely and uncertain and for the young and vulnerable a fairly psychologically toxic place to grow up……..something we think the “Hot Feminist” needs to do; and before she settles down and has children.\n11.06.15 Girl bares breasts in Malaysia and goes to prison – nothing sums the worlds moral contradictions better\nA young woman and a few friends get naked in Malaysia…apparently triggering an earthquake and end up in prison. Nothing sums up the sad state of modern world morality better than this rather strange tale. For the Malaysians we at All-Faiths-and -None ask “What” are you serious! However, whilst the “earthquake element” is probably a bit of casual tabloid sub contextualized racism the point for the west to consider is why is it considered so Ok or indeed normal to behave in this way. Nakedness because of its association with sex and reproductive intimacy immediately causes one to forget the person and concentrate on the sexual object when seen out of an intimate context. This is bad enough but on a mountain, with friends it clearly falls outside the context of intimate behaviour occurring within an environment where intimacy should take place. In the west nakedness, sex and stimulation are seen as goods, products to be pursued and even traded with no concept of the consequences; be those consequences “offending the gods” or getting pregnant with a child neither parent really wants.\n29.06.15 Tunisian Beach Massacre-Do we really understand this war on our way of life.\nFrom the slightly ridiculous “breasts on the mountain” conflict between the East and Western culture we have another far more tragedy with 36 people dead on a holiday beach. Again, the politician’s response is correctly to identify this as a war on our way of life; criminals identified with Islam shooting half naked holiday makers on a beach. The Prime Minister of Britain comments that it is a challenge to our democracy peace and tolerance”. At A-Faiths-a-none we believe a slightly different direction needs to be taken in respect of this debate. We saw with Charlie Hebdo that our desire to poke the wasps nest ends up causing a loss of life often more than one life at that and always more than the mild provocation merited or could ever justify. But still it goes on.\n“Islam is a religion of peace”, all faiths have promoted themselves as religions of peace; but until comparatively recently this peace applied to “believers” only. As we have said before faith helps bring stability to groups of people be they family, country, or empire. Faith removes the uncertainty and fear that would make civilisation impossible. Islamic “civilisation” was a place of rules and strict punishments that worked when a society was eking out a living in a dust bowl or an area of economic and social uncertainty. These Islamic rules of civilisation are no longer needed by the western societies. We don’t need to make the world “gendered” and discriminatory. We have through welfare and economic growth all but removed economic insecurity. However, in doing this we have created a social world in which common place rules of Islam are flouted at every turn. Immodesty being one obvious one but also the abandonment of the family to a make it up as you go along lifestyle. We don’t want to go over all the issues here but perhaps the real problem between the west and Islam is similar to the conflict of beliefs between the unconstrained secular world (the world of porn, over consumption, social uncertainty and valueless wealth creation) and the beliefs of those of faith….any faith and those with a secular morality which puts the long term ahead of immediate need for gratification; that is one of lifestyle. To a simple Muslim way of thinking our high levels of “immorality” renders our way of live unsustainable; and ready to be brought down.\nPerhaps our western societies with our lack of collective moral identity and behaviour in respect of so much of what extremist Islam is still obsessing about, is our main weakness. Perhaps we should accept that what we do and the way we do it, promote it and brook no dissension that it is “liberating” for us all, is a problem. If we don’t get this right soon, we will for very many in the world confuse with immorality with democracy; a very much unintended consequence. By seeking a wider debate with those of all faiths and none we might understand a little better why the “western lifestyle” is hated by a growing number of people in the world……before it is too late.\n03.07.15 The Left and the cause of the confusion over faith race and extremism\nWe have commented on this topic before and suggested that any attempt to segregate the sexes is a romantic throwback to an era and culture when segregation was more a fact of hard economics than a fetishized behaviour by zealots which cannot capture or promote the way modern society either should do or needs to operate.\nHowever, the topic does not go away due to the link all things gender related have with “extremism” and the apparent sympathetic view taken towards those who peddle gender discrimination, perversely get from the British left; particularly the student left. All-faiths-and-none being both faith based and Darwinian always view the opinions of the young as generally a little ill-informed as their views are generally not based on tried and trusted social or economic progressive models but on the need to experiment with some daft ideas and theoretical concepts which offend parents in particular but any authority in general. However whilst most youthful opinion is generally seen as harmless and indeed “progressive”…evolutionary if you like…sympathy with segregation is most definitely devolutionary and harmful to society in general and women in particular; giving modern western women the taste of an era and culture where women were routinely segregated out of economic and social necessity. This really hasn’t happened in western cultures for thousands of years and certainly not on the grand scale you see in the modern Middle East even now. So what is really going on, is the student left is supporting a form of cultural imperialism, demanded by Islamic cultural extremists, that has no and never has had any connection with the culture of the west…..probably but they are too ill informed to know that. Is that a problem…..well no if segregation is not forced on the unwilling and is understood as being both an irrelevant and discriminatory practice that is alien to the West and counter-productive in terms of enhancing social and economic value but yes if somehow it is enforced and used to try and undermine the wests attempts to preserve freedom and equality.\nTo preserve and promote a culture based on gender discrimination you have to undermine any society and its economy if it is based on freedom and choice, contract and consent. The student British left are like the man sawing off the branch of the tree he is sitting on. Beware of what you wish for guys ……the girls may never forgive you.\n08.07.15 To counter the pessimism of Tony Blair let us explore “Secular Westernism” as a cause of terrorism\nTerrorism is not inevitable; it is caused and fuelled by ideological and religious forces with only the very fringes objecting to democracy, freedom and equality. However, a far larger group of the faithful of many faiths object to the culture of what we at Blue Revolution call “Western Secularism”. The interpretation of secularism peculiar to the west which has perverted most of what is essentially good about western culture, good which is inherent within the wests “free market” systems (consent, choice and contract). We call it Secular Westernism, as opposed to say Chinese secularism, simply because they are very different, have different influences and radically different outcomes.\nWhat we argue is this; that the faith community and those Darwinians who promote the concept of the long term survival of the most able and adaptable societies, dislike the outcomes of Secular Westernism and the combination of unrestrained moral freedom and the free market effectively marketizing areas that were once managed on a personal level by individuals making pro social moral choices. This was most often based on a belief in the preservation of social value (community, the family etc), all-be-that in the past, supported by religious faith. Today too many people enjoy unrestrained personal excess as the expense of the State, the community, the family and indeed their own good health and moral hygiene and have no concept of wider moral values beyond their own immediate freedoms and needs.\nSo, let us not pretend there is no solution to the problem of terrorism and religious intolerance. That is true if you are as Tony Blair arguably is, the high priest of Western Secularism…….but not if you believe as we do that there is an alternative in the form of encouraging a new wide spread moral revolution…..as we call it; the Blue Revolution.\n11.07.15 The Next Modern Deadly Sin-Number 4; Breach of Trust\nThis one is relatively simple to explain but breach of it can be devastating as it applies to situations where there is an expectation of trust such as a workplace or as in our “Sin” a relationship. What should we make of a society where many; perhaps too many intimate relationships fail out of complacency or boredom and the people in those relationships deceitfully seek comfort elsewhere?\nOf course, relationships should end when there is violence or cruelty and ending it is the best option for all parties. However, we have looked at “objectification” as a sin and where this exists there is pressure to move to a more adoring partner or seek more excitement. This often happens deceitfully as no one wants to be breaching trust and therefor being essentially dishonest. We have therefore built breach of trust into the normal expectation of relationships and as relationships are the building blocks of society, so we have built it into the wider expectations of society. No society can thrive with dishonesty “downloaded” into its informal social structure and in the west, we survive because the moral jeopardy associated with relationship dishonesty is largely met by governments.\nBreach of trust in relationships is a “sin”, it damages people and families it undermines communities and so widespread is it, that one could claim it is a part of the Secular Western culture we describe as “Secular Westernism”, as described in the last posting. To avoid “breaching trust” within the no faiths secular community, failing relationships should be consciously uncoupled or ended with respect on both sides, and both parties move on in the knowledge that no dishonesty has taken place. Hopefully without children. However in respect of the faith communities we would support the view that a relationship failure should be avoided and care should be taken to ensure faith based friendship is the key stone of the relationship rather than money, looks, narcissism, or objectification rendering it a short term arrangement at the outset. The term Secular Westernism really sums up the values totality of the western world with all its marvels of freedom, choice, consent, contract but with the downside of our “seven deadly sins” letting the side down and antagonizing too many people of faith. More sins to follow.\n20.07.15 ISIS are not the same as religious extremists; David Cameron needs to understand the difference\nAs we have said in the past ISIS are simply criminals; people who destroy value or impede the creation of value are criminals and the evidence of this seeps out of ISIS controlled areas daily. Brutality and destruction, fear and hatred provide no framework for creating the economic value and wealth necessary to support a population. But ISIS don’t care because they don’t understand economics and if they did, they would probably regard brutality as the only way to run, what we at A-F-a N call a dust bowl economy. A dust bowl economy for those unfamiliar with the term is any economy where economic value is not created by diverse human endeavour either because such value either doesn’t exist even in the raw form of primary resources (as in ISIS territory) or is simply pumped out of the ground by industrial processes whilst the wealth extracted props up an oppressive feudal system.\nI hope you can see where we might be going with this.\nAnyway, David Cameron the British PM wants to tackle extremists when what we suspect he means are either violent extremists or better still Criminals identifying themselves as Muslims. The culture of Westernism is confused about Islam; as it is about all faiths, having abandoned faith-based morality, in favour of a now failing secular model of morality based around consumption as opposed to production. This happened sometime after the Second World War. We believe the “driver” for this was the belief that politics could deliver what Christian faith would or could not, namely “equality”. But an apparent equality to consume is not the same as real political equality, a point we will I am sure develop over the next few years.\nAs with Marxism the prevailing post war view was that religion was the opium of the people. Holding back the desire for political and economic equality. There was at that time as now the basic principles of contract, choice and consent; the building blocks of freedom and democracy, but these were, it was argued, not delivering “equality” thus this equality was not available to all. Women, and those who’s sexuality was not heterosexual were penalised and the poor and working classes were seen as having limited economic choices, so the religious morality underpinning Christian Westernism had to go. The point that was missed though was that Christian morality was more about ensuring economic stability to produce rather than as now creating economic conditions to consume. The point however is that the culture back the was very different from today’s culture even though we had the same core principals the social outcomes were vastly different.\nSo, what you may ask has this got to do with extremism. Well back before the rise of Secular Westernism we imprisoned gay people, women had unequal pay and a Christian wife was expected to give way in all things to her husband. Rape was not illegal in marriage and an establishment ran things their way with their morality designed to protect them and preserve their little peccadilloes. Sounds to me like the views of extremists and all of that apparently (if not actually) supported by state religion; Christian religion. These were extremist times, but they were not violent extremist times. And the non-violent extremists are still out there; many Muslims like their devout Christian compatriots have strident views about sexual morality, women’s rights, welfare, marriage, abortion and so on and so forth. They have views about modesty, adultery and illegitimacy but it doesn’t make them want to go out and bomb, mutilate and stone people (even though some might argue for this). Extremist Muslims are just one group of the very devout who don’t like Secular Westernism, but they must not be confused with the criminals and violent extremists who are ISIS and want to destroy it. They must also not be identified as people who threaten the West’s culture of freedom and democracy based as it is on Contract Choice and Consent because, like the West, they can enjoy wealth created by the economic value available within our diverse society and with choice and consent they can practice their faith as they see fit. What they are quite right to do; as we at Blue Revolution do and that is look at the positives that Secular Westernism has delivered…..but also look at how by opting out of faith based morality altogether Western Secularism has creates a moral context which offends very many faith communities and not just Muslims. David Cameron understands this but like the secularised Church of England……he doesn’t I suspect want to be seen to do morality!\nDisliking Secular Westernism now that it has gone too far from being overtly moral in character is no proof of criminality any more than seeing Saudi Arabia as a brutal and oppressive throwback to the moral Dark Ages makes you a racist or cultural imperialist. Strong moral views are good, irrespective of how much someone may loath them…….enforcing them on others with violence is criminal and should be treated as such.\n26.07.15 British Lib Dem equivocates over homosexuality- is this Ok we ask?\nTim Farron the Lib Dem leader who is a Christian is evasive about homosexuality. The British left wing is now on a mission to “out” him as an intolerant bigot so the public can be reassured that morality in safe in the hands of the British Left and the “Guardian” reading intellectuals. We at Blue Revolution say what rot. The mischief here is that in the realm of opinion as opposed to behaviour Mr Farron cannot hold a moral position without being taken to task and effectively “closed down”. The role of religion has become so removed from Western culture in all but a few symbolic relics such as “Presidential Oath of Office” in the US or in GB the State opening of Parliament etc it is now seen as irrelevant; unless of course its views conflict with those of the oh so right on morally muddled Left Wing.\nWhat gives the British Left the right to close down someone’s argument simply because they have private views that they, the left wing doesn’t like. Mr Farron would we are sure bear no malice towards gay people, he would we are sure afford them respect and the right to live their life as they see fit. However, he may not identify this lifestyle as one that morally fits into his framework of reference as he is a Christian. If you ask the young men coming out of Mosques their opinions, they may agree with Mr Farron but unlike the Christian many may express harder opinions perhaps including punishment for Gay people.\nThe left of course fails to see that any faith or moral opinion that does not wholeheartedly support homosexuality, is not necessarily un-accepting of that different lifestyle. We at Blue Revolution do not support adultery as a lifestyle choice, but we don’t think people who are adulterous should be punished. And so, I am sure it is with Mr Farron and his views on homosexuality. The real sadness in this story is that the collectivist Left long associated with despotism and intolerance, for those who don’t concede to their dogma, are at it again, peddling intolerance and stupidity. There is more similarity between the modus operandi of the left wing and the regimes of Saudi Arabia and The Peoples Republic of China than there is between Mr Farron the British left or these ghastly regimes. He needs to openly uphold the right to have moral opinions which differs from that of the Left, and by implication much of mainstream Secular Westernism. By doing this he will be allowing people (Christian and Muslim alike) to experience moral disagreement within a free society which promotes peaceful acceptance of all beliefs within the rule of law. Something the left wing has never really “got”.\n01.08.15 Migrants in Calais-what does a coherent response look like; the Blue Revolution view\nThe BBC sympathises, or appears to, the left criticizes the language used to describe the migrants, “swarms” for example, the French want rid of them and the British don’t want them so they try and keep them in France. The British Army may be mobilised; but what is really going to sort out this long- term global problem. In reality the problem can and will get worse; and it is a bad problem because whilst the human rights lobby see this as a simple an easy enough to fix humanitarian crisis and extend concern, understanding and a home in the UK, the crisis is essentially an economic, cultural and moral crisis and is best understood as such.\nAs we at Blue Revolution continually say; faith and culture are and should be intrinsically tied up with the creation of value both social and financial, out of which a society can support its population; faith or lack of it can promote or hinder this process. In the west value both social and economic is created by the diverse interplay of people of all faiths and none with an enthusiastic acceptance that, whilst we all may have different views about many things, we are on the whole united in our belief that limiting human productivity on the basis of gender race, age disability or sexuality is wrong. This is the basic culture of the west; delivered by its Christian but now largely secular heritage. There are problems however, we are too promiscuous, and our family units are unstable, we don’t manage those who fail the system very well either, so we have depression, crime and substance misuse. Plus, we have too many who commit our new “seven Deadly Sins” (some still to follow) and undermine the basic “good” in western culture.\nThere in lies the problem.\nThe Eritreans, Somalis, Sudanese, young men queuing up at Calais are not bringing with them values which we need or can realistically use, so in large numbers they will fail to deliver “value” in our complex society; be that social value or economic value. Whilst there may be exceptions to this, on the whole they will bring a set of beliefs and values that will be ideal for supporting a more traditional society of rule based morality where there are clear definitions of moral and immoral behaviour which as with all traditional societies (completely understandably by us here at Blue Revolution) relates to gender and sexuality much more so than it does in the west. They will have views which identify difference as something to be feared and therefore fought and punished. In our view this is the main misunderstanding by the “human rights lobby”. We believe it makes us look delusional in our dealings with other faiths and cultures and to some extend makes us vulnerable as a culture to being taken advantage of.\nIf the west and in particular Europe wants to deal with this crisis in a humane way they must first understand the moral background of the people who want to come here and on that basis stop being as deluded about what the migrants can offer, as the migrants are themselves. Then they should ensure that the tide of migration stops at the ports in North Africa and that the vast amounts of money wasted in supporting the EU “machine” is used to promote diverse and thriving economies in the countries of North Africa. The entrepreneurs who “swarm” here would be better using their risk taking resilience to build value of a more 21st century character into their own societies benefitting from the liberalising effects of trade, rather than coming to the west; becoming overwhelmed and angered by a culture that alienates them…..and many of us too.\nThere can be no justification for propping up a failing Bureaucracy in Europe whilst Europe as an economy is being assailed by migrants who simply become dependent on its social welfare systems and resentful of its culture and its failure to respect and absorb their more intolerant values. We all need to look more critically and objectively at what being part of different cultures actually means for both the migrant and ourselves. Of course the crisis situation in Calais is humanitarian…..but it is cultural as well, on both sides.\n05.08.15 Thought Crime, conflict and faith\nWe were thinking the other day having written a number of blogs relating to subjects such as extremism, sexuality and Immigration and the role of faith in the debate about these issues that the western world has over the last decade or so entered a period of casual but very obvious “thought crime”; whilst we believe what we have said is moderate, we experience in daily life the views of faith communities being challenged as extreme, abusive, fundamentalist for example. Words like “problematic”, “unacceptable” become ways of closing discussion and stifling the evolution of the human mind and human shared experience. This is done by ushering in a slow devolution of the human mind and spirit by limiting the topics and views one can express in the political or public sphere. The two words above are the opposites of acceptance and understanding, particularly when the prefix is “that is” and the suffix is “to me”. This elevates silencing debate to a level of emotional manipulation which is at odds with an open society and, as during the New Labour years, is a way of deliberately closing debate, then done under the banner of “diversity” to “protect” “vulnerable groups”. Protection is the least likely outcome. The effect is that such tactics simply send the controversial discussions underground and as a result makes the public feel alienated and angry. We have seen this within working class communities with the whole issue of the EU and immigration and within other communities it manifests itself in a deep dislike of the “decadent” culture of Secular Westernism. Don’t stifle debate whatever the topic…..\n08.08.15 What price Love- Kids Company and the bean counters\nCamilla Batmanghelidjh the articulate and eccentric head of Kids Company (KC) managed to get philanthropists and Prime Ministers to part with large sums of their own and tax-payers money to support her project offering hope to inner city Kids. The main issue seems to be she claimed KC were helping tens of thousands of children, yet the evidence indicated numbers in the mid to late hundreds. Another issue seems to be that envelopes of cash were being given to kids with no accountability as to how the money was being spent. From the Blue Revolution perspective there are two things which are relevant to this story. The first is that Camilla Batmanghelidjh and I am sure the salaried people who worked for KC loved the children they worked with. The evident chaos and mismanagement criticised by Civil Servants would happily reflect the environment of the big loving family so evident in the past but less in evidence now. Today and more so in our inner cities we produce too few loving families and too many “family units” comprising an array of characters some permanent some temporary, and the young, displaced by this arrangement end up, in South London at least, seeking love and care with people like Ms Batmanghelidjh. The second point and perhaps the keystone to the whole saga is that today in every relevant context “love means money”. The problem for Ms Batmanghelidjh is that the money was tax-payers money. How many middle-class families have very much loved, sons and daughters who need the odd £20.00 un-repayable “loan” two or three times a week.\nWe at Blue Revolution don’t know how one squares this circle, but it seems to us everyone in this story has a valid point. The problem is the valid points do not solve the puzzle of how we provide the love that is missing in a society where a component of love has unfortunately become money. Perhaps the whole thing starts; as we have said before, with people making moral choices about whether and when to have children and with whom; and when those children arrive, making the now superhuman effort to bring them up properly so they don’t lawlessly spill out onto the streets at all hours. We would then not need Ms Batmanghelidjh or the tax-payers money she is accused of wasting. However as with much of the Blue Revolution philosophy, that is not likely to happen anytime soon.\n10.08.15 Deadly Sin Number 5- Want based consumption.\nOf the Seven Modern Deadly Sins this one is the widest ranging and touches upon almost all of the subjects covered in this blog to date. It touches on philosophy, economics, theology and perhaps somewhat unexpectedly ecology. It is not the most harmful of the seven deadly sins, harmful to individuals in the short term at least, but its range is vast and over time its impact will be massive. It forms a large component of what we call “Secular Westernism”\nIn the past the culture that most people were exposed to was shaped by the needs of the economy and reflected the social reality to which the economic realities gave rise. The nomads and slash and burn economies were differentiated by the different ways’ wealth was created. Wealth being maybe a regular supply of forage or hard-won meat such as Deer. As we have said in previous posts the dust bowl economy of the Middle East was a thousand years ago a hard environment to fashion into wealth creation so the culture was hard and rigid; this was to minimise waste and avoid any dissent which might undermine the economic model in existence at the time. The accent was on production and inequality was a powerful element in ensuring the value created as high as possible. The slave society and social rank played a part in keeping the economy supplied with sufficient value to allow all but the most dissenting and troublesome to survive.\nObedience to the social norms meant personal and family or clan survival. This is the context that ISIS operate within today and the place their policy of violent destruction of western values, would like to return. At Blue Revolution we believe this desire to return to the dust bowl is so we can exist in a pure rule based moral state complete with stoning and beheadings to remind us that we live in society where Value is hard to create and they the criminals of ISIS are in charge of the production of what little value is created. The enlightenment and Christian faiths ability to adapt to it finally liberated us from the horror of this type of existence three hundred years or more ago. However, we have we believe at Blue Revolution thrown the value creating baby out with the want based consumption bath water.\nBased on the Blue Revolution analysis (should you choose to accept it) the dust bowl or fearful and meagre existence of the past is a place we have been to and not a place we should be in any hurry to return to. However, life is full of paradox and by maintaining a culture on the basis that want drives the economy rather than need, we have moved too far away from the production of value as the factor that underpins Western culture and morality. We call this Secular Westernism as it is what happens when you remove the moral rule book and allow people through millions of individual choices to drive an economy based on their personal desire to consume, when that consumption is derived not from production but from credit and overzealous Government spending and welfare programmes.\nWe all share some of the blame for the Banking crisis, for social instability and the many other sins and vices that we at Blue Revolution gather up and call Secular Westernism. As a result of these issues we produce too little economic value, too little social value and the bit that makes it look like this broken system works is want based consumption paid for by debt and the funny money of government spending. Secular Westernism is essentially a Junk Society; a high calorie confection of spending, insecurity and debt with no nourishment.\nWith production of real value as the base of the economy rather than want based consumption, people’s expectations would be more realistic. Families would hang together, as getting out of the family would not in these circumstances, lead to a widening of the income sources available for want based consumption; by freeing equity for example. Want based consumption is planet destroying; it promotes an unsustainable birth rate amongst groups who would be economically incapable of having children were the state not to step in and subsidize their offspring. More tellingly every Pound Stirling, dollar or Euro produced to meet consumption needs (predominantly via consumption debt) is driving the carbon economy more than any other single factor. A modern parable is useful here. It is about two men; one wise and one not so wise.\nThe wiseman who produced fruit in his fields sold his produce at market and made himself very wealthy. He took his wealth much of which he did not need for the support of his family and pot it in a large hole in the ground, unmarked and with the expectation he would never dig it up. His neighbour sole his fruit at market but used the money he made to buy cars and take holidays, his expectations and those of his family became set at a life style too high for the fluctuations in the harvest to support so the man borrowed to enable his lifestyle to continue. Who might you ask was kinder to the planet?\n21,08.15 Jeremy Corbyn; left wing ideology and violent Islam What does this love in tell us about all three.\nLeft wing politics; the home of supposed tolerance, is also the home of anti Semitism, trans activism and radical feminism and to varying degrees has framed policies that over the years we at Blue Revolution believe have undermined the family, the rights of fathers and children and ushered into existence a hitherto unheard of a class of people who are detached from the expectation that they should work, behave responsibly, and make some kind of social or economic contribution for the benefit of wider society.\nThe so called “under class” is a product of a welfare system shorn of moral content as it was set up by Victorian capitalists to correct short term labour market failure. Only the naïve Guardian reader or handwringing beneficiary of a salary from working within the system could possibly see this as a good system. Its bi products of this cash on demand system are divorce, promiscuity, drink, drugs and industrial scale illegitimacy and are clearly not the kinds of outcomes that any traditional rule based society would tolerate. Indeed in Isil territory as we know, stoning takes place as it does in Saudi Arabia for “crimes” such as “Harlotry”. How many “Harlots” do we have in many of our towns and cities of whom violent Islamicists would exercise little sympathy and where the promiscuous male becomes the persecutor of immoral behaviour when that immoral behaviour is homosexuality or promiscuity by women. Collective moral action it could be called shorn of any respect for the individual based on contract, choice and consent.\nAnd yet it is the British left who are cradled in the loving arms of the very men who would have a violent reaction to most of the policies the British left has introduced and continues to support and promote.\nWe at Blue Revolution also support acceptance and the freedom to be homosexual or promiscuous but we on the other hand don’t accept the behaviour of violent Islamicist and so would not hob nob with them as the British left do. This situation of mutual support between the violent religious and political group think and the left is one of those paradoxes which only makes sense if you look at the whole thing at once; a bit like an Escher drawing. The Left’s support for Islamic traditionalism makes sense if you look at it as racial, as underprivilege to be addressed by taxation of the rich, or wealth redistribution, or social projects to support diversity or Palestine or alleged American Imperialism. But look further beyond those safe set piece areas of common ground, and it all starts to look a little less safe for the individual. There is much bad about the West its Capitalism and its “secular westernism”; but left-wing collective action combined with other collectivist groups of a more intolerant hue probably isn’t the answer.\nWe need to de construct the relationship between the British left and violent Islamicism to understand the risks, and when we do, we will see that the British left is intolerant and in its own way aggressive to the rights of the individual. Gays and women are at serious risk of harm from the views of the violent Islamicists becoming lodged into the wholly naïve views of British left. Their muddled idealism will act as the vector for forces hostile to the rights of the individual. The lingering remnants of “dust bowl” morality in the world will be nourished by these naïve people who fail to see that their grand political causes are simply a means for the intolerant to undermine the rights and freedoms of others.\nMarxism began life as a liberal ideology; and Marx himself in many ways never removed himself too far from the rights of the individual, seeing the role of Capitalism to confer bourgeois rights on the individual to trade and contract freely, admittedly in purely economic terms, but at the core of the model was freedom…….including as he rightly condemned the freedom to fail and to starve. The latter becoming the emotional driver for state intervention which in turn became collectivist as opposed to liberal Marxism, with its violent revolution and its perverse willingness to see people starve.\nRevolutionary Marxism caused limits to be placed on the rights of the individual as the revolutionary model requires individual rights to be set aside in favour of the rights of the collective. One extreme of this is National Socialism, or perhaps the role of Socialism in giving collective heft to theocratic revolutions such as Iran in the 1970’s, or Arab Nationalism where getting a mob to support an idea was the required way of gaining and keeping power.\nAt the other rather more harmless end of collectivism where for example equal pay was undermined in the 1940’s to the 1970’s collectively by Trades Unions in favour of male employment, and then when equal pay came in companies went bankrupt as they had to level their wages up.\nThe failure of Capitalism it could be argued has been in not bedding into other cultures the concept of personal freedom and in the case of advanced capitalism, not expressing personal freedom fully and democratically. Capitalism in attempting to protect its system from the mob limits power to Parliamentary process. In addition, too many communities remain dominated by control of the individual be that control exercised through religious or patriarchal means.\nBecause the Left abandoned Marxist “freedom”, in favour of harnessing the collective “will of the people” shaped and managed by experts or leaders, it meshes very well with other collectivist bodies and groups many of which are unreformed rule based and religious or political in character. For these groups respect for the individual does not extend to protecting individuals from deliberate physical or psychological harm.\nIt is this fit which makes the Left and Mr Corbyn a man to watch. Blairism for all its many failings was pro individual rights, Blair’s success in promoting extended rights to minorities was in part a product of the slow relentless decline of the “industrial powerhouses” of Trades Unionism where since the war Misogyny and homophobia was casual and common place as anyone over 40 will surely remember. A characteristic of the masculine culture of the time.\nCorbyn is essentially a useful fool for the likes of Hezbollah, and Hamas the IRA or even perhaps Isis……he clearly does not understand that freedom is based not on Government empowerment of the interests of the aggressive political or theological collectives. Remember the adage that one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. Freedom from tyranny comes with empowerment of the individual through amongst other things the Blue Revolution trio of Contract, Choice and Consent, practiced within a regulated free market framework and available universally to all adults.\nIf we support our politicians siding with those whose obligations are to the collective and the collective, whoever that is, believes some horrible stuff, our politicians won’t be able to put the genie of individual rights back in the bottle if that genie escapes…….they can only hope as they are rubbing the lamp that the genie stays put.\n26.08.15 British girls-unhappiest in EU. But why?\nMuch of what we have covered so far is relevant to the question; why British girls are so unhappy. Commentators speculate about pressures of school-work, broken families and relationships, but these applies to boys also. As an insightful group of people we thought we would add our Blue Revolution perspective on what in public health terms is probably as much a problem, if not a more serious problem, than the British diabetes epidemic. We will explain why.\nWe recently wrote about the jihadi brides, and more recently still about the inherent misogyny of “collectivist” cultures into which we folded groups who ignore individual rights (by for example blowing people up) such as Isis, Hamas, the IRA as well as to a less extreme degree the hard left of the Labour movement. At the most extreme the Jihadi brides expose the terrible conflicts faced by girls. To be desirable to a man but not to be overtly desirable conflicts with cultural expectations. To be cleaver but not so that it confers independence and may result in the traditional social role ascribed to girls being undermined. To be subordinate to one’s culture in a world which offers the most grotesque forms of self-promotion and self-expression. Being conflicted is hard to deal with…..ask any abused person who loves their abuser! So, in the case of Jihadi Brides the easiest way of escaping this psychological torture chamber is to opt for one side of the conflict or the other. Violent Islam wins out against Secular Westernism. The fact these Brides are too western to cut it with Isis we presume only dawns on them once they are trapped in a pitiless well of psychopathy and random aggression.\nIf Jihadi brides are the extreme how can this conflicted situation apply to Secular Western girls with one presumes no such personal, familial and religious challenges. Well just because there is no obvious religious pressure it does not follow that there is not an oppressive secular western culture causing conflicts of psychological intensity for girls. We have our seven modern deadly sins to complete, but so far we have looked at cruelty, objectification, breach of trust, want based consumption, and arguably just these four set a confusing context for young people.\nBeing measured by looks with the unwanted attention that this brings, whilst being insecure due to the absence of trust within many modern relationships will be stressful. Having the expectations that looks will bring financial success and therefore “want based consumption” whilst also having to grapple with the reality that childbirth will takes much of it away. Even in the 21st century childbirth remains the foundation of the proto fascism in the form of men’s dominion over woman.\nThe politically naïve and ideologically muddled Jeremy Corbyn supports women only carriages on trains an obvious throwback to women’s primary role and mankind’s primary expectation of women; childbirth and seclusion, whether they like it or not. In western culture girls who see themselves as having no economic role, do what nature requires of them, but not as society intended. For many there is no loving coupling but life as a stressed single mum whose choice was never “free” but heavily influenced by “welfare”; promoting the lifestyle of babies with no greater economic role but to consume benefits.\nWith the west offering, but not always delivering or fully respecting, the hard fought for “economic role” for girls, is it any wonder girls are unhappy. Boys don’t have this complexity to navigate. Girls do have this psychologically conflicted set of choices and in all honesty only the very brightest and economically most literate can navigate a coherent way through it. Perhaps we should focus on the economic role of girls, rather than the biological role that has led to thousands of years of oppression. We should stop promoting and subsidising childbirth as an option for girls, aside perhaps from only those who can cope with it sharing the role with a partner as necessary, in order to do it properly.\nPromoting the idea that girls have an important economic role without babies, do not have to have babies to be valued by society, and should avoid being seduced by the state into having babies for purely individual economic reasons, will surely help girls feel less conflicted and therefore a little bit happier.\n03.09.15 Faith and revolution- Red or Blue\nFaith and religion has had a mixed reception politically; somehow linked, but closely, obliquely or distantly depending on its political use. Roman Catholic attempts to regime change in South American nations three or more decades ago; as well as the revolution in Iran in the late 1970’s and in Burma much more recently. There has been Marx’s view that it was the “opium of the people” whilst Russia and China suppressed it in the same way that the dust bowl elements of Islam do the same to all faith but their own. In Britain the success of Christianity has been its failing as its ability to drive enterprise and risk taking has delivered past economic success whilst paying for relentless moral decline. The state in the form of Her Majesty’s Government stepping in to prevent some form of 21st century Peasants Revolt but making the problem worse. In pre Tudor times poverty was revered and the poor and those who gave alms were chosen for heaven, through to the 16th Century when the idea began to emerge that being poor was a crime to be punished and therefore to be avoided and not subsidised by state or the wealthy.\nIn the west and in America what faith there is, is too often associated with narcissism, hubris and greed. Theology offering wealth to the devout and God-fearing TV subscribers! In the Middle East we have a combination of dust bowl economies, some super rich and immoral by modern standards, and some poor and immoral as well as criminal. In the west and in Britain we have an established church which has defaulted to secularism in the last 30 years to such an extent the theology might best be described as the theology of being nice, with a nice undemanding liturgy to go along with it. However today alongside nice faith we have angry people looking for an angry faith or an angry politics. I need not dwell too much on this but to invite people to think about where these angry impulses are finding expression.\nThe faith that seems to offer some hope to some people is Islam, rule based and helpfully for some dogmatic. The politics which has gained recent traction is a kind of nationalism which has no traditional left right dimensions but is all about expecting “Government” to protect us; in Britain, it’s never clear protecting us from what. The Bankers, migrants, immigrants, the rich, the poor, who knows, but for some reason best known to Britain’s army of middle aged, armchair Prime Ministers, both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage capture the spirit of what they are supporting politically. And that seems to us to be a kind of collectivism that for these people binds the nation together, nationalism as a substitute for class, although we don’t think many would recognise that as informing their opinions. In this post class world, the nation unites and binds in the way that class used to. hence the success of Ukip and SNP and strangely perhaps the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. Should we be concerned? Are we at Blue Revolution concerned? Well yes and no.\nIn Britain the problem for the Church of England is that without the church being linked to a political collectivism, like class, it loses the ties that bind people to the faith, thus in the west the Christian faith is in terminal decline. In Britain the C of E is still operating, though on the back of wealth accumulated over the last 600 years or so. In America faith survives with televangelism and snake oil, but like in the UK, not in places where faith is really needed.\nWith Islam the theology is more political, both local and global. Immoral immodest behaviour at home, western aggression or indifference abroad. The political issues grant a collective legitimacy to Islam that is echoed and respected in the political collectivism of the left. Though as we have said in previous posts this attraction isn’t really understood by either side. A bit like two people drawn to each other but neither really understand why. Thus, there is a political and faith convergence which would be a cause for celebration amongst people of faith like us, if the thing that linked them wasn’t an out of date and possibly hazardous collectivism. Collectivism we believe leads to the rights of the individual being ignored as the individual is pushed aside by the clamour to achieve “collective outcomes by collective action”. The growing albeit ill defined demand for collectivism and government intervention amongst our armchair PM’s both erstwhile and new labour party “supporters” will lead the Labour Party in the UK to fracturing somewhere down a fault line to the left of its centre. The centre right parliamentary party we believe, will be pushed to breaking point by the accession of Jeremy Corbyn. The centre right MP’s will either be shoved out, to find a home in other parties or will just go willingly elsewhere. The Political left and the collectivist hangers on will make the Labour Party, not a serious party of government, but a left wing campaigning collective with a hotch potch of ideas that will in time increasingly ignore the rights of individuals and groups that don’t fit in to their world picture. It certainly won’t be All Faiths and None but more my “faith” not yours. This is the problem with the British hard left, they won’t know when they have fired the starting pistol for an attempt at a Red Revolution.\nWe at Blue Revolution advocate a Blue Revolution. It should be clear what this is from what we have written so far. It is a revolution in the hearts and minds of individuals who recognise that peace comes from using the freedoms accorded by Contract, Choice and Consent in a moral faith based way (Blue Revolution) that supports democracy, supports and respects all people of all faiths and none and rejects behaviour which is cruel, immodest, needlessly consuming, untrustworthy etc but all delivered at a personal level by individual moral agents….because in a world dominated by immoral or sinful behaviours only the collective action of the state can bring control to the chaos……..it’s a pity no mainstream faith can combine their theology with the theology of freedom as reflected in the Blue revolution.\n07.09.15 Sexual offending, exclusions, unhappiness- What is going on with British students\nThis is going to be a short but topical post to try and offer the Blue Revolution perspective on British youth who have hit the headlines this week for some of the worst reasons. It has to be accepted that there are some inspiring young people, those who are brave in the face of adversity and challenge and those with potential to achieve great things on behalf of themselves and their family and their community. However in this post industrial world of Secular Westernism too many young people lack belief ; belief in a creed, belief in a God or even a belief in themselves. The Blue Revolution view is that this leaves them vulnerable to the superficial temptations of Secular Western culture with its self medicating stimulants of Sex and drugs and needless consumption. When these are not easily attainable by a growing number of low aspiring young people the lack of belief in themselves to achieve something for themselves encourages rule breaking. Thus we have too much sexual offending and too much unruly behaviour and low performance and further reduced expectations.\nWe are not called Blue Revolution because we believe some people don’t have faith in themselves, but because we accept that not all people have a religious faith; however we accept Darwinism as a substitute for faith and we can identify the concept of group survival as integral to the role all faith has had in mankind’s evolution since we first became self conscious thousands of years ago. Hence the need to accept all faiths….. and none. More young people need to be inspired to have faith, even if it is limited to faith in themselves and the contribution they can make to the long term development of humanity as reflected in their group or community. Every human being regardless of age or ability is gaining, through technology, the opportunity to contribute to their group and community; but for some the lack of personal belief set in a world of superficial social and economic charms, proves to be too tempting for them, and thus harmful to others.\nThe revolution starts in the heart of the individual and not the head of the group.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_wokeness-decoded/content_318.html": "Wokery decoded\nDe Coding Wokeness; A Simple Guide.\nWe hear a lot about the woke. But what is it to be woke? To understand wokeness it is necessary to understand a couple of theories one going back to the 1950s called postmodernism an oversimplification of Marxist consciousness and the other a more recent corruption of postmodernism which is called Critical Social Justice Theory. Both focus on feelings and identities.\nIn the 1950’s it became fashionable to stop looking at social concepts as fixed and to start seeing concepts like marriage, or gender, as fluid. Things were capable of being defined in a non-prescriptive way by different people. So, for example, ‘femininity’ was once a definition which had accepted social characteristics. It would have defined how a person dresses, modifies their looks, maybe speaks and how they relate to other people. The idea that post modernists developed said that just because you were biologically ‘female’ you did not have to look or behave or have your attitudes shaped by what ‘western’ society said was feminine. This seems reasonable, ask any tomboy!\nThe feminists who argued this had in mind a world where your biology should not define what femininity looked like. So, they were pushing against social ‘norms’ that defined ‘femininity’. Back in the 1950s femininity was for example not smoking a pipe or wearing a three-piece suit or being powerful in business. Femininity was back in the 1940s and 1950’s the opposite of these ‘masculine’ identities. This became the foothills of wokeness. The early ‘awakening’ that what was ‘real’ like ‘femininity’ or ‘masculinity’ might just be a ‘social construction’ and therefore capable of being changed, becoming ‘fluid’.\nWhat these early and innocent pioneers who were called postmodernists did not say was that if you identified as ‘feminine’ you became ‘female’. Their views were influenced by feminists, so they would have rejected any idea that by identifying as something other than you were, you became that something you identified with.\nFor example, within the range of ‘masculinities’, it is backed up by research that some white boys identify with black street culture and therefore adopt what is seen ‘on the streets’ as a black identity. But it does not make them black. They are white boys identifying as black for reasons of identity. They know that too.\nHowever, in full-blown ‘woke’ ideology, within certain groups (which incidentally does not include white boys), you can become that with which you identify. This is no more clearly evidenced than in trans radicalism. If we go back to the 1940s and 1950s with the largely French intellectuals who created postmodernism, a female was a biological reality, not a social ‘identity’. The social identity was ‘feminine’. So, for them, a biological female could dress like a man, swear like a man, have sex like a man and bear no resemblance to the ‘social identity’ ‘feminine’. She might choose to adopt every ‘masculine’ characteristic imaginable like fighting, but she was a female and biologically different from males. This is the misunderstanding the ‘woke’ either do not understand or ignore. They believe that it is possible to ‘change sex’. You cannot change your sex, but you can change your sexual identity.\nAs a result of the ignorance or misunderstanding of lawmakers, it is now possible to change your sex on your birth certificate. This is wrong. There should be a box added to the birth certificate that allows you at the age of 18+ to re-identify other than as your birth sex.\nSo, what does this mean when dealing with woke people. Very simply it means that a trans man, is one form of identity within the biological sex ‘female’ and a trans woman is one form of identity within the biological sex male. For males, you might argue that at one extreme there is ‘toxic’ masculinity e.g. a belief, often seen in some religious groups, that men are powerful and must be obeyed by women, and at the other end there are males who identify as females. But they are not females they are an extreme form of male identity that rejects ‘masculinity’ as an identity of choice. Anyone who tries to argue against these facts…..is called a transphobe.\nMoving on from confusion over transexual identities the critical social justice ideology or wokeness has done a similar exercise with the colour of people’s skin. So, this time whilst there is no doubting one’s skin colour, the ‘identity’ associated with that skin colour is defined. Black people are ‘defined’ as victims of ‘structural disadvantage’ and white people are defined as the ‘oppressors’. This ignores that in capitalist and post-capitalist society there are victims of structural disadvantage who are white and millionaire successes who are black. Class and status is a far better determinant of success and failure than skin colour. A person’s class is defined by their ability to accumulate capital or get access to capital, even if that capital is in the form of taxation paid to people as high public sector wages.\nSo structural disadvantage isn’t about poor white people keeping black people down but white upper-middle-class people who decide the social and economic rules (senior politicians, civil servants, Charity and BBC executives etc) but they pretend it is ‘nothing to do with us, guvnor’. Anyone applying for a job in the public sector knows how ‘the right candidate’ must have, if not a ‘middle class’ background, learnt middle-class skills with verbal and nonverbal reasoning, and knowledge of psychometric tests etc being demonstrated irrespective of skin colour.\nThat is why there are probably proportionally more people who are black in the ‘structurally disadvantaged class, but it is not because they are black its because they are poor and have little access to capital accumulation or the ability to acquire the ‘right’ kind of learnt skills. They have not been allowed to progress by a middle class elitist system that pretends its fair to all, whilst then blaming poor white people for the failure of some black people.\nSo, the real reason there are disadvantaged black people and white people is that there really is ‘structural disadvantage’ and it is getting worse. But it is not racial it is class-based and more and more people will eventually fall into the disadvantaged category. Only then will the scales on the eyes of indebted students and the politically angry white middle class, finally lift as they will see who the real enemies of poor black and white people are. The elitist system that gate keeps entry only to those with the knowledge to get in and shuts everyone ese out. In other words, poorer disadvantaged people of whatever colour.\nFinally, we need to explore the woke obsession with Islam and the baffling protection of it from justified critique. This is baffling paradox seems to be the result of the woke misunderstanding both the nature of Islam and the real role of western thinking in liberating people from rule-based religious dogma.\nIslam is an ideology based on the application of strict rules which either ban things or allow things. These rules were revealed to Mohammed as the word of God in the 7th century by the Angel Gabriel. Gabriel was the Angel who also foretold the birth of Jesus who whilst not the word of God, was the Son of God, born six hundred years before Mohammed. The Prophet Mohammed had views which were very typical of the 7th century Arab Peninsular and elsewhere in the Middle East. He believed women were inferior to men, worth financially half as much as men in fact. He also believed in waging war against non-Muslims to provide booty for the cause of Islam. There are other ‘characteristics’ often levelled as criticisms of Islam such as child marriage, but in fairness, these were just typical of the 7th century almost everywhere.\nSo, Islam is about strict do and don’ts. The woke do seem conflicted about do’s and don’ts. They like their do’s, hating western history for example, but get angry if they are told to accept others do’s like for example having the freedom to speak your mind. How they would feel about Islam is something one can only speculate about. The problem for the woke is that in their muddled critical social justice theorising, they focus on bashing western freedom, seeing it solely as the cause of disadvantage for non-white people. However too many of their preferred identities clash irreconcilable but abhorring freedom of speech, nothing is ever said. So, for example, traditional Islam and feminism clash, feminism, and trans-activism clash and trans activism and lesbian and Gay rights clash and Lesbianism and Gay rights clash with traditional Islam.\nThe woke really do not know what the historical and scientific reality is behind what they believe or maybe what the implications are for what they believe in terms of freedom. This is because the woke are simply obsessed with the superficiality of social identities defined for minorities by them and their social justice mentors. So maybe like people who see identity as personal rather than sociological, we should just stop paying them any attention.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_material-determinism-promoting-moral-behaviour-in-a-free-society/content_351.html": "Material determinism-promoting moral behaviour in a free society\nOne of the problems of the modern world is that there is too much emphasis on each of us getting our own way; having what we want; being stimulated for a short time with for example drink, drugs or sex. Such personal preoccupations and obsessions can and do lead to cruelty because we sometimes find we get less than we think we deserve and we can behave cruelly and get away with it because cruelty can be and often is under the radar of the law and decades ago we mothballed our collective moral radar in the drive for inclusivity, making previously immoral behaviours, acceptable. This in itself was a good thing but to hold us together as a society we need some moral principles to avoid social incoherence and a plethora of competing moralities. We will examine how economic determinism can provide a legitimate moral framework that can apply evenhandedly around the planet. To bring life to our ideas we will focus on what we believe to be the Western words seven deadly sins. We begin with cruelty.\nThe sort of cruelty seen most often but not exclusively is within families or other close-knit groups. Cruelty has to have an element of viciousness or vindictiveness about it as the perpetrators aim is to cause hurt to another as a response to their own error of judgement in getting into a situation they no longer value respect or like.\nWe rush into ill-considered relationships driven by our urge to enjoy the stimulation and dream-like effects of sexual activity. We don’t stop ourselves from this headlong rush to get “intimate” and indeed there are people who see little harm in promiscuity and “pop up relationships” like you can dial up on Tinder or Grindr.\nHowever the prevalence of promiscuity reflects two fundamental issues closely linked to cruelty; the extent to which people throw away something which should be special; the company of a partner and friend whom they wish to love and cherish, and from whom they should expect the same; and the lack of any consideration about whether any new relationship has long-term social or economic value. This is where materialism comes in. It is always necessary to consider the wider economic implications of especially a free choice.\nBy the time people realise their mistake there may be children and responsibility plus the boredom of a relationship that has “intimacy” but one neither respects or loves. This is the environment within which cruelty breeds.\nIt is manifest in a number of acts some easily understood such as adultery, all the way down to causing someone to worry (staying out later than agreed and not returning concerned calls), words of indifference “oh do what you want”, words of irritation “oh go away” to words designed to cause harm “you are stupid/ugly/useless”. These casual acts of cruelty harm the recipients emotionally and ultimately are a sign that the perpetrator and victim have made poor life choices. Often the perpetrator is unprepared to take responsibility for their behaviour. Grinding low-level cruelty causes depression and suicide drug and alcohol misuse.\nThe proliferation of pornographic material is to meet the needs of men and women trapped into unsatisfactory relationships yet preoccupied with sex. Its overt use can be an act of cruelty itself. Its existence reflects a market driven by short-term socially and economically shallow obsessions with the here and now.\nAt its most extreme cruelty is domestic violence and child abuse, seen in all too many households. This is the reason that in the western world cruelty is one of the most prevalent of our modern seven deadly sins.\nTo avoid committing this common modern sin we need to return to a way of life that requires us to consider relationships carefully and avoid getting trapped into situations where cruelty is used as a means of feeling better about ourselves as we cope within a self-inflicted dire situation.With freedom comes personal responsibility, you can blame no one else.\nThe Western world has since the eighteenth century championed the three principles of Consent, Choice and Contract as a means of protecting the individual in business. These bourgeois legal and economic principles have over the years taken on a social character so we use them in life, in general. We need to observe them as secular moral principles and use them wisely in all our dealings with each other. If we don’t there is a risk that we will leave ourselves open to the claim that we should have morals imposed upon us by government diktat or religious uprising, because without them we simply behave with animal-like cruelty.\nContract, choice and consent when deployed thoughtfully and particularly in all potentially intimate scenarios will provide a framework for respecting others, deter rash behaviour and prevent harm. We have much to gain by re familiarising ourselves with three of the principles of the 17th-century bourgeois revolution.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_it-is-impossible-to-ignore-exploitative-capitalist-structures-within-corbyns-new-jerusalem/content_368.html": "It is impossible to ignore exploitative structures within Corbyn’s New Jerusalem\nChanging society and making social progress is a slow process, hence the reason the shortest timescale for a Blue Revolution’s radical agenda to transform and increase democracy and make Britain safe for all is thirty years. The reason progress is slow is that we like to adopt the mean, go for the middle, and so extreme views create shift incrementally and only over time does the mean change. It is as with Ukip often quite capable of shifting back too. Hence the current shift back to the 1970’s with both Labour and Conservatives. The 1970’s provides two well known although out of date operating model for both parties which somehow feels wrong to us in the 21st Century.\nWhat is interesting about the Labour approach to economics is how it mirrors the authoritarianism of what one might call capitalism at its worst. With capitalism at its worst, we had the man with the stove pipe hat ordering exploited workers about and then taking the proceeds of their labour as his profit. The reason socialists deride ‘capital’ is that it is the store of value which rightly belongs to the workers but has been appropriated by the capitalist. The structures within which the appropriation takes place are hierarchical, authoritarian and deny the worker a sense of owning the processes of their labour. They are alienated from the production process and therefore alienated from the economy. They, the workers, exist in an economy over which they have no control.\nWhat Corbyn and the Labour party want to do is replace what they believe to be a system which is like this system, with their socialist New Jerusalem. Jeremy Corbyn, Seamus Milne and John McDonnell at the head of a system that takes tax off people and which pays for services and industry. The means by which they will do this are unfortunately hierarchical, authoritarian and deny the worker a sense of owning the processes of their labour as even the poor have to pay tax for this expensive system and will operate in a hierarchy over which they have no control. The reason why the Socialist New Jerusalem is like this is that it takes its inspiration from the old capitalist system it is so quick to condemn. However where the capitalist system has risk and failure built in so that there is a churn in the market generating lower costs to consumers and improved services, in the left’s New Jerusalem the state halts all of this. It takes on ownership of the means of production and the delivery of services but with no functioning market, the whole system becomes atrophied. What also does not change is the hierarchy which has serried ranks of officials and politicians paying themselves tax payers money so they can enhance their personal wealth, payment to them for running the state and its industries. Unfortunately, this mirrors the exploitation of the worker under capitalism.\nThe bad news for Britain is that the progressive parties are far from progressive and the Conservatives whilst not wanting to re-implement this taxpayer exploiting model don’t do anything to reduce the people’s tax burden. No wonder we feel alienated, frustrated and ill. No one is arguing for us they are all in various ways looking out for themselves, most notably the progressives of the left.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-bbc-and-analogue-political-attitudes-in-a-digital-age/content_110.html": "The BBC and Analogue political attitudes in a digital age.\nThe BBC prides itself on its inclusive attitudes to everything. The blatant smuggery when advancing a progressive cause, leaves most normal people feeling a little nauseous. And then aside from the smuggery there is the unapologetic bias demonstrated for example prior to Brexit when every ‘Leath’ principle was twisted to ensure we were being educated about the horrors of Brexit even if ostensibly we should have been just informed or entertained.\nThe BBC has recently ‘justified’ itself to Elon Musk. Exposed to the full sanctimony of the state broadcaster’s delusion that as it is ‘publicly funded’ its output is wholly universally legitimate.\nThe BBC operates a coercive model of revenue raising. It’s more akin to a protection racket than a service supplier. Threats to licence fee avoiders are frequent in an age when people want to have personal control over what they buy. However, the most harmful effects of this ‘state sanctioned’ model of broadcasting is that Its output is designed to promote, not just the politics of one party or another (based on a crude numerical formula that fails democracy once you get down to constituency levels) but is designed to reinforce the status quo. The status quo being the top down, attack and defend binary system of politics designed in the eighteenth century, which is described as ‘embarrassing’ by a growing army of disillusioned voters.\nThe claim to support minorities referred to above and to promote minority interests fails once you stray into politics. This is when the BBC shows its true ‘state broadcaster’ credentials. It will subtly overlook some political groups whilst almost embarrassingly falling over themselves to promote others. The flim flam of their ‘policy documents’ allows them to justify whatever they do to whomsoever they need to justify it, and that is usually just to themselves.\nTwo cases in point. In 2017 a small group of people started a political group called Blue Revolution. The idea came to us because it was clear the political system was stale, elitist, and failing to deliver policies that benefitted working people financially. Debt was the ‘money supply’ and rich few were getting richer whilst they systematically ‘fleeced’ the many. As a business model this aligns perfectly with the licence fee-based BBC funding model. 2017 was the year of Theresa May’s ill judged General Election and having only existed for a Month ‘Blue Revolution’ felt compelled to field a candidate.\nThe BBC Radio 5 Live team came to Skegness for a constituency visit with Emma Barnet and an unfunny Irish comedian and placed their caravan adjacent to the beach. Blue Revolution, one of only five candidates standing in that constituency were not invited to participate in the seaside discussion. However, there was a ‘stand in’ for the Ukip candidate representing Paul Nuttal the then Ukip leader. Why go to a constituency and base your choice of interviewees on the established parties? Why not see what else is out there at a grass roots political level? Why not examine the views of political minorities? Because the BBC is the broadcaster of the British State, and the British State wants to maintain the political status quo. Anyone struggling to be hard or more over questioning the legitimacy of party based, top down, attack and defend parliamentary politics is not given a voice. Subsequently the Blue Revolution candidate was invited to chat to Emma Barnet. But it was clearly just intended to be a piss-take. Without his consent decreed that he was to become mere entertainment, rather than to inform. A subsequent complaint resulted is the usual self-justifying BBC waffle.\nRoll onto 2023 and the public’s appetite for alternative ideas to the ‘embarrassing’ status quo has increased. Blue Revolution has fought council seats and is gaining an increasing vote share, whilst steadfastly observing the principle that a formal party structure is bad for democracy. It’s a slow burn process getting candidates elected as there can be no central ’command and control’ structure beloved of mainstream parties and some ‘independent’ groups.\nHowever, in 2023 Blue Revolution fielded eight candidates in the May elections. This made the group the third largest after the new Boston Independents Party and the Conservatives. Blue Revolution ran a good campaign as eight independents under the same banner. Blue Revolution increased its vote share and managed to get a councillor elected. However, it received absolutely no coverage from the BBC unlike the new Boston Independent Party. This no coverage even extended to no reference to the group name. This resulted in the name Blue Revolution being omitted from the BBC website detailing the final council results. Which then failed to be referenced on Wikipedia. It thus gives a false picture of Boston’s political history. You don’t need the Russians to interfered in elections when you have the BBC.\nThe BBC is an outdated institution. A throwback to power based analogue politics but in a new less tired digital age.",

Yet another calamitous outcome from 12 years of “new Labour”!\nThere are many reasons to look back on the period between 1997 and 2010 with regret. Blair promised “Cool Britannia” but gave us the laughable claim to end “Boom and Bust”, the death of David Kelly, the war in Iraq, the Bank or rather debt crisis, wasteful Millennium projects, sucking up to US neo-Cons and the nonsense of Post neoclassical endogenous growth theory. All were and some still are calamitous policies that have weakened and indebted Britain and the British worker because we were persuaded Blair knew best. British history is confirming Blair knew how to look after himself best at the expense of Britain as a nation no more and no less.\nThere is one issue which is only now beginning to emerge as a “crisis” and that is the mental health of the young. Again the “left” are banging on about resourcing when the problem is with the usual time delay for cause and effect squarely down to the period from 1997 onwards. The Tories can’t struggle off the leash entirely but the policies that affect the young are essentially Blair’s.\nIn 1997 and leading up to the hubris of the millennium young people were seen as the saviours of Britain. Young people were to be “invested” in and schools would deliver bright millennials who would deliver the “cool Britannia” success promoted by Blair. At that point, the “Cool Britannia” brigade were not millennials but Thatcher’s Children or even pre Thatcher, Pop idols and TV people in their 20’s and 30’s. Still, they could be “culturally appropriated” by Blair and of course they were.\nThe real millennials were fed a diet of New Labour Hubris, had to endure an education system which took away the competition and promoted an unrealistic sense of equality by “coursework assessments”. Grade inflation was the means of persuading parents that children were getting brighter and that a university education would transform working-class lives for young people. There was also a “gifted and talented” programme for anyone who could hold a pencil the right way up. Money was given to students in tertiary education, most of it went on drugs and booze. These were woolly and naive aspirations with “shonky” mechanics underpinning the social engineering.\nHowever what has created the current Mental Health crisis amongst the young isn’t just the woolly New Labour thinking of their early childhoods or its less deranged but not yet wholly abolished form, today. It is the social and economic context within which all this naive social engineering was and still is operating. Add in the breakdown of all too many families, and the stress of single parenthood and you have just about the worst context within which to lack wealth, have debt and possess a second-rate degree.\nThe outcome of the whole lot; social engineering, educational tinkering and context, from 1997 to the present day has in too many instances resulted in more crime from the unemployed second generation ex-industrial and agricultural workers; and rising levels of mental health problems for the employed working and middle classes. So how do we analyse the problem at Blue Revolution? And what would we do to put it right?\nFirstly the workplace was described as a place of opportunity for the new graduates. How many proud parents from derailed working class communities believed that a student loan was money well borrowed. Whilst their proper working class jobs might have been rendered uneconomic by the standards of the global labour market, their kids with degrees would be able to cut it with the worlds best. Or perhaps not. The market for degrees is unlike the state education system, overall fiercely meritocratic. Having borrowed to get their degree the youths returned to their working-class communities to the sort of work they were doing before they left. The additional problem for many was that unskilled migrants had taken up much of the “work offer” limiting opportunities whilst driving the wage level down to the minimum wage. (NB the minimum wage was needed by New Labour because without it mass immigration would have resulted in starvation wages for working people). The minimum wage has become the maximum wage for too many young people.\nSo that’s the impact of the unplanned for globalisation of labour, student loans and too few good jobs for the thousands of graduates the system churned out, immigration and the minimum wage. If that were not enough, what else has contributed towards the mental health problems of the young?\nWell, “economic reality” affects the poorer young more than say someone like Euan Blair. Most of the graduates from the run of the mill Uni’s know they have been ripped off to help keep a supplicant socialist industry funded. Higher education (like most of the education sector) is the “intellectual” wing of the Labour Party and so who cares if a few poorer kids get into debt to fund this important left-wing leaning national industry.\nSo with all the disadvantages of competing at the bottom end of society, with debt and diminishing opportunities in their own communities, the poorer student has to stand back and watch as the sons and daughters of the elite, more often than not a taxpayer-funded elite, hoover up the few decent jobs that there are in what apart from “the City” remains the lucrative part of the labour market, the top ranks of politics and the public sector.\nThe students from poorer backgrounds have the same expectations as the Blairs. Blair was great at selling a dream. Unfortunately, it was a dream few could achieve. So the final insult to the poorer young and students is that they are given a sense of personal failure. This isn’t delivered in the usual way by pushy parents. Modern poorer parents are genuinely sad about their children’s limited opportunities with debt and worthless degrees, and sad about their own gullibility at believing the worthless Blair mantra “education, education, education”. So the expectation that creates the sense of personal failure is the hubris of new labour and it’s belief that supporting a client “industry” like education with student debt was a way of killing two birds with one stone and delivering “Cool Britannia” and making most of Britain’s young globally competitive.\nUnfortunately, we can see now that with weak economic fundamentals this hubris is causing depression, feelings of hopelessness and catastrophe. This is however only amongst poorer kids with their debt, worthless degrees, no home too “own” and the prospect of losing what little inheritance they might get as the state, supporting another “industry”, cares for their ageing unemployed parents.\nOn a positive note, at least we can see the state sorting out the problem by piling money into “Mental Health”. Perhaps however if the present “state” were to shrink and let people run the country with some semblance of a constitutional monarchy we wouldn’t need a Mental health “industry” at all. Just a thought.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_are-british-workers-unified-by-class-or-values/content_252.html": "Are British workers unified by class or values?\nThe values we in the western world now accept without question were born in the fierce heat of 18th Century Capitalism. They were described by Marx as bourgeois values. They were in addition to freedom from feudal oppression, the freedoms of Contract, Choice and Consent. There was of course unfairness which meant that unless you “made it” within this system you could not enjoy the full fruits and freedoms of bourgeois life. You might have had the right to contract, choose and consent but your life was defined by your wealth.\nOf course whilst Capitalism, as a system was gender, religion and racially unprejudiced (anyone could become a Capitalist) society, discriminated mercilessly. So back in the 18th Century, bourgeois rights were essentially male rights and white male rights at that.\nThe intervening period up to today has seen the extension of these bourgeois rights to an ever-expanding population of people few of whom can actually call themselves “bourgeois”. Being bourgeois identifies your relationship to Capital, it isn’t about how much money you have but who created the wealth that you possess. If it was created by “exploited” workers you are a Capitalist in possession of Capital. If you are public sector Chief Exec on £300,000 you are not a capitalist just a very wealthy person paid out of the Nations Debt.\nOn this basis, therefore with the decline of “capitalism,” the “workers” have become more so than ever before a large unified group of people, women, men, people of all ethnicities and identities for whom the values of contract, choice and consent are an expectation of daily life. Only the confused on the left seem to regard removing or limiting these rights a legitimate policy objective. They would usher in a 16th-century policy of silencing dissent and showing prejudice against certain groups. For the vast majority of people, the challenge is to protect these bourgeois rights now we have acquired them and learn to use them to personal and social advantage without inflicting economic and social decay via a breakdown in social cohesion.\nA breakdown in social cohesion is the major threat to western societies and there are many pretenders to the Wests throne offering various sorts of primitivism to compensate for the apparent breakdown of society arising from our new found freedoms. What these various groups of primitives fail to appreciate however is that whilst there will be some “adjustment” as we start to accept the full personal responsibility for the freedoms we have, we are all united in our desire not to have these freedoms compromised by politicians, religions or simply nasty unpleasant people.\nBritish working people are in economic terms no longer differentiated by class and are largely an undifferentiated group who have fought hard to get the shared values we now enjoy. Now we must scan the horizon to establish who is trying to undermine us and our values of contract, choice and consent and deal with them robustly.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-14-02-17-to-24-05-17/content_200.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 14.02.17 to 24.05.17\nBlue Revolution Archive Page 1\n14.02.17 Riots in British Jails and a crisis in criminal justice. The cause might be the madness of the Blair years and the focus on “self-esteem” and judicial process.\nTo solve the crisis in prisons we need a root and branch reform of the system, and that means clearing out the remote and frankly baffled politicians and tame the money grubbing lawyers who shame the system. It will never be properly “humane” and protect the people who pay for the system (us!) unless this lot have been cleared out or at least severely re-configured. However, who might actually be to Blame? unlike our usual perspective on such matters (ok we are lying!), we blame Blair. Here’s why!\nTony “things can only get better” Blair managed to achieve a landslide victory in 1997 by basically exaggerating the capacity of the state to deliver “social justice”. This was something that the by then hated “Tories” under John Major, had increasingly recognised as undeliverable. Something it pretty much still is!\nBlair’s David Ikeesque “third way” was delivered at both a social level, for example, ramping up expenditure on social work interventions to “tackle the causes of poverty” and raise the “self-esteem” of the poor through a pointless “gifted and talented programme” and cash handouts for booze, sorry for tertiary education. The hip and right on New Labour government also encouraged “relationships” between economically inactive teenagers and the system still does. In addition, poverty was not identified as due to poor decision making and thus placed at an individual’s door but blamed on all sorts of things which were on the whole largely “lifestyle choices” for the reckless or just plain stupid.\nAt a structural level, the new Blair establishment extended the power of the courts in the form of the human rights lobby and created a politicised legal system, based on a strict legal process which is always costly when a QC costs £600 per hour!!However within its criminal Courts there was no reform, the old sanction of imprisonment for all “serious” offences still held sway as the deterrence of last resort. Of course, the lawyers were at the vanguard of the humanising of this 18th-century system as Human Rights Act litigation was Blair’s way of improving things rather than changing things in any meaningful way. Work for Mrs Blair?\nThis was naivety in extremis. On the one hand blaming the “system” for poverty, crime and unemployment whilst making prison the States’ (or rather taxpayers) preferred sanction of choice for the incorrigible and irredeemable offender. This is such a breathtakingly stupid combination that this “Blair” generation of offender’s “self-esteem” overflowing as they strut about smashing up prisons assaulting staff and demanding their “human rights” see no need to reform, none of it is their fault.\nThis sorry mess is overseen by an army of lawyers who are only too happy to oblige with litigation because it is all at the expense of everyone except the “litigant” or of course the “state” that ushered this system into being (remember that the State and the people are not the same thing…yet!!). The solution is not as Liz “rabbit in headlights” Truss suggests, more of the same! But we have offered a solution before and we will offer it again!\nFirstly, we need to move away from the toxicity of current welfare and put an end to the mythology put about by the virtuous left that being poor can somehow be blamed on the state. The state on behalf of the people can help by encouraging responsible parenting (for example making parents responsible for their offspring beyond the age of 18) as well as discouraging, by financial and social means, the workless and feckless underclass from having children they can’t support. This is not social engineering which is soul destroying it is life-affirming, particularly for the children of people who properly contract together to have children and don’t see the responsibility for paying for them coming from the taxpayer via the state.\nThe me, me, me-ism of the modern parent must stop. The creation of an entitled “Blairite” underclass, from the remnants of the second generation and now all too often work-less, industrial working class, has to stop. These are the rioting “toddlers” of the criminal justice system, or the single mums struggling to cope with their child men either in prison or if at home, pestering them for sex and a male identity. These “Blairs-men” are the cause of so much crime and unhappiness.\nSecondly, the criminal justice system needs to come to terms with the fact that it no longer represents the interests of the Crown or the Capitalist system. Neither really exist in any meaningful form, hence the Corbynista’s demand for the abolition of both betrays both a breath-taking arrogance and total ignorance of what constitutes the modern economy. The modern economy is debt and consumption dependent and the people who drive the economy and pay the wages of the state’s workers are ordinary people with their debt-based spending and tax payments. So, if you agree that this is the case and the offender’s punishments are both paid for by the people and they the offenders, are on the whole “of the people” (few capitalists or aristo’s in prison) what sort of Criminal justice system would the “people” want?\nWell to answer this one must avoid asking the “industrialists” of the criminal justice system namely the top managers, contractors, Judges and lawyers and ask the people. With little prompting, most people want effective deterrence and punishment with the accent on “prevention of further offending and harm”.\nPrevention of further offending in a system which is gamed to encourage further offending is almost impossible. Parents suffer as their wayward children veer off course and into a system which warehouses them often only briefly before spitting them back out again. Prison is such a weak deterrence it becomes a home from home, less harsh than a spell of national Service as some of us know all too well.\nThe answer is to slightly reconfigure the “system” so that the tier of the court is not determined by the alleged seriousness of the offence but by the likely severity of the sentence thus getting away from the “Just Deserts” model enshrined in our still feudal legal system. In our model, the severity of the sentence is determined by the risk of further offending (custody for those “dangerous or incorrigible offenders) but punishment can be carried out in the community by way of modern technology for those unlikely to re-offend, and that is very many.\nHow many people would not view house arrest, tracking, tagging, removal of driving licence, passport, exclusion from places and fines as punishment? Also, the reason we don’t pay for our own punishment today is that the “system” was set up when the system represented the interests of the rich, and the system’s “customers” were poor and wretched and destitute and therefore had no money or assets. That has all changed and now we could expect Rolf Harris or Jeffrey Archer to pay a considerable sum (short of making them destitute) for the punishment they receive. The state, on the taxpayer’s behalf, could put a charge on their house!\nNow the obstacles to this system are systemic and in our opinion, the issue of public perception which is used to maintain the status quo (basically the Daily Mail stirring up the “mob” (on behalf of the establishment) into a vengeful fury) needs to be called to order. The systemic problem is a legal buy-in. Within this more cost-effective system, the vast majority of wrongdoers will be effectively punished in the community and could be dealt with in the lower courts with any “breach” of their punishment sent to the higher court for lengthy custody. Wrongdoers at every level will know they are being punished and it will hurt to a greater or lesser extent. This will leave the system able to deal with the army of “Blairs-men” who fight, riot and like Blair argue, blame and incite rebellion and for whom reform, rehabilitation and resettlement are probably not possible….the damage was done almost at birth.\nSo, who will object to these proposals? Well judges might find that too many “serious” offenders are sentenced by lower courts, Barristers will have less work in higher courts, people in the form of the Daily Mail will be horrified if “serious” offenders plead guilty in lower courts because they are able to be sentenced and to maintain a home or job, albeit under very strict and restrictive conditions. Politicians scared to lead the debate will cow tow to the Feudal lobby of lawyers and maintain the status quo. And of course, any closure of prisons will have the unions up in arms demanding a regular but manageable through-put of offenders who can be warehoused and who’s life they can effectively destroy. Oh but all this is not paid for by any of them ….it’s paid for by us!\n18.02.17 There is no stopping the elite from advancing the cause of Remain. The reason is jobs for themselves not the global values they pretend are under threat from Brexit.\nIt doesn’t matter whether it is Blair or his elite Blairs-men (as opposed to welfare dependent Blairs-men) such as Osborn, Clegg or Cameron. They are all completely incapable of gaining the kind of insight that the thinking, as opposed to feeling, Brexiteers have about the decision the country made last year to leave the EU. The reason is quite simple. The EU and its agencies and outposts of empire provide jobs for the kind of people the Blair’s and other elites hobnob with on a regular basis. There are thousands of well-remunerated jobs in a whole range of impressive but often largely irrelevant departments in the EU. These allow this self-defined and self-perpetuating elite to enjoy a good lifestyle at the public’s expense. It is really ****** outrageous! Pardon our French.\nHowever, the belief that the elite are needed to govern us is the bitter irony at the heart of the whole EU fiasco. They are the last people who should govern. They really think that we ordinary people are too stupid, greedy and selfish to manage the economy and play our part in society without having them to guide us and steer us towards their definition of a new Jerusalem. However, if we look at the facts of the case, we see that a revolution is required and that the people who are abusive are not “the people” but the elite. Without getting too boring about it let us just consider two examples.\nHow many people are exploited by the local plumber, baker, electrician, factory worker, or the person who works in a supermarket? We would hazard none. How many people are exploited by a Customs Union which locks the EU out of trade deals with countries that are crying out to share wealth and values which are shamefully locked into the EU with its cosy gravy train? We would argue millions and too many young males, with no work at home, migrate to the EU where the money is, and with cultural incompatibilities ever present become something of a hazard. So, we have an EU elite patronising Europe’s workers ignoring the concerns of the working class and whilst barely able to articulate that the problem of migration is one of trade policy, their trade policy, confining numerous countries to starvation and poverty. Britain with Brexit will strive to correct this.\nThe second example of how the elite should go away and engage is some serious soul searching relates to our old friend “Tone”. “Tone” goes to appalling regimes all over the world talking about we suspect anodyne globalised waffle and gets paid thousands of pounds. Now there lies the problem for the world’s exploited working people. All the countries he visits will be exploiting or abusing workers, many are feudal or tribal systems where human rights are essentially conferred by rank as was the case in the UK six hundred years ago. So here we have “progressive” Blair and his ilk taking money that has been exploitatively appropriated from oppressed people by a foreign elite who are still operating a social system based on coercion, power and control. Blair should be asked: “who has been exploited so you can have so much money?” The truthful answer should be “just about everyone!”\nShould we trust our own elite…..you must be ******* joking! Pardon our French!\n18.02.17 Mrs May is sorting out Domestic Abuse and we applaud that, but the issue of the damaged co-dependent couple risks turning the problem into another “industry” for the state.\nDomestic abuse is horrendous and a throwback to primitive relationships based on power and control. In the 21st century, the power doesn’t always rest with the male, as we rightly promote and expect equality between the genders thus women are quite capable of exercising wholly unacceptable power over males. Domestic abuse does, however, affect more women than men\nIn our usual way, we will take a slightly oblique view of the problem. For us, the problem has its origins social expectations, and these have changed over the last sixty years.\nIn the past males and females had roles prescribed for them by a society which only recognised the reproductive role ascribed by a person’s gender. Wider economic considerations for women were largely ignored. Marriage was about sex and reproduction. Marriage was based on “social expectations” and perhaps even “lust”. This resulted in too many people feeling pressured into marriage. Once married, a form of social entrapment ensured too many lives were blighted by misery and unhappiness. The Divorce Act’s slowly made liberation from these sad arrangements possible. All well and good.\nBy the 1980’s marriage became a contract that was not really worth the paper it was written on. We refer to marriage as an “illiterate’s contract” as it was made verbally, usually in church, and was upheld by society rather than enforced in law. It lacked the proper terms a real contract would contain just vague promises.\nfrom the 1980’s onwards marriages came and went, and families reconstituted and often reconstituted again. The basis for the abuse within the marriage shifted from frustration caused by a feeling of entrapment to a feeling that marriage was being undermined and social expectations were being toyed with. Men in particular, felt divorce marginalised them as women became more liberated.\nWithin the marriage “industry” this is pretty much how it goes today. A big ceremony then expensive divorce. Marriage is a wholly inadequate “contract” upon which to base decisions about bearing, raising and safely nurturing children. The law says adults should put the children first but marriage breakdown and immature behaviour by parents suggest that this is just not happening in all too many cases.\nHaving said that Marriage based partnerships are not where the domestic abuse is most prevalent today partly because there are more cost and formalities involved in getting married and a “stigma” about “bad divorce”. Also, many people have voted with their feet and save themselves the grief and tensions of divorce by not getting married in the first place.\nModern domestic abuse (DA) still happens in marriage but it has spread into numerous other relationships. The single mum on welfare with her boyfriend is the most vulnerable of the new victims of domestic abuse. Their vulnerability a result of the psychological weakness within families occurring over the last 30 years and rendering many family’s incapable of bringing up grounded children, mature and self-confident enough to become the next generation of parents. This is particularly problematic for boys who with access to pornography are having their expectations of girls defined by sex, whilst too many girls encouraged by welfare, define themselves not by their economic capability but by their reproductive capacity.\nUnlike the 1950’s the non-marriage family today often lacks the father of the child. The state has taken this father role away from too many men, having created the single, unemployable and too often criminal young male (Blairs-men as we call them) who fathers and then walks away from responsibility. However, he often doesn’t go away for long; he is usually back the next time he wants sex and exercises a proprietorial control over the mother of his children. Some women to avoid this territorial behaviour or because they are simply “a shag” will have children by multiple fathers. The mutual insecurity triggers abuse and too often violence. These women, as well as the mothers of these child-men, are the most common victims of modern domestic abuse.\nTo the politician’s the answer will be of course be a lot more prison for DA offenders and more agencies working together to protect victims. The problem is that the males and females locked into these dysfunctional relationships can’t really escape them. The women are trapped by motherhood both in terms of having the father(s) of her child/children to deal with as well as abuse from their lost angry Blairs-men sons. The reality is that these sad and co-dependent people have none of the psychological strength to leave flawed relationships and this confines them to a life of misery and the taxpayer to a lot of expense.\nThe Blue Revolution solution is to get real about the causes of the problem, welfare and family breakdown, and to ensure that marriage stops being an illiterates contract and becomes a properly entered into a contract which spells out marital and parental obligations before children are born or at least very shortly after their birth. This applies to all parents and DNA will prove parenthood if necessary, to ensure responsibility isn’t shirked. In this sense, the romance might suffer but everyone involved should have a better idea what is involved when you create a legal contract and bring children into the world.\nNo one is forced to have children and too many people who do should not. The answer is to recognise choice and consent in the decision to have children (stop infantilising working class girls by assuming they lack the capacity to make an informed choice about pregnancy) and then make the decision to have children a legal contract between the parents, wider family and where necessary and only where necessary the state. This should increase responsible behaviour, make people and families accountable for their children and grandchildren and get the state largely out of a system where it simply “games” in favour of the least capable parents.\n20.02.17 People don’t understand economic determinism. However, it explains not only why “progressive” social change takes place but also why things don’t happen. V2\nEconomic determinism, little referred to and little understood. In simple terms, it is the process by which an economy creates economic value (in western culture that means how it makes money) and how this affects the social arrangements. Thus, the economy affects issues like people’s rights and freedoms and to what extent they are determined by gender, rank or class.\nIf you read some of our earlier post’s they go into more detail however it is enough to say that the means of economic production sets the template for social arrangements and individual rights. What can or cannot be done socially is determined by what freedoms the means of production or the real economy allows.\nCapitalism freed people from tribal and feudal bondage. The capitalist means of creating wealth conferred rights on people, rights such as contract, choice and consent upon which is constructed freedom and democracy.\nThe rights capitalism conferred were limited at first, as only the rich could enjoy them but eventually, these rights have been conferred on everyone. Whilst few will identify it as a legacy of Capitalism gender equality and the equality of sexualities is down to capitalism.\nCampaigning has been important as no one would have allowed “gay marriage” or gender realignment without an active campaign demanding these rights but the social and economic context was permission giving, rather than hostile or even hateful. The question for us all is why?\nSorry but there is too much red wine in this post. Sack the political economist as we want to hear from our tame politician about Stoke and Copeland.\n25.02.17 Stoke and Copeland…..lessons for Labour, but the death rattle for Ukip.\nStoke and Copeland were fascinating results and we could and really should have tried to predict the result so predictable it turned out to be. The lessons from these results fall into three.\n1) UKIP are finished as a political force and the working people who voted for them will start to drift away from them in future elections. As their votes are now “mobile” there is everything to play for.\n2) The Conservatives can and are picking up working people’s votes and Theresa May is very persuasive as a kind of people’s champion. Hence, they won Copeland. The Theresa effect could, in theory, continue for a long time to come, not just because of the state of the other parties but because she seems to be offering a kind of Blue Revolution lite. Theresa May is navigating the choppy waters of 21st-century politics and economics with more skill than the opposition.\n3) The intervention by David Miliband completely misses the point. Yes, Labour is a mess, but let us at a Blue Revolution offer them some objective analysis rather than Miliband’s “if you had voted for me as leader none of this would have happened” political narcissism. Labour’s two factions are in deep trouble. The Blairites first. The main problem for the Blairites is that the brand is toxic, associated with illegal war and a culture of selfish indifference to the concerns of real people coupled with a grotesque obsession with getting rich, hence their love of Remain and the EU. Thus, the simpering, well-intentioned but essentially careerist Blairites are about as appealing to the general voter as an evening hearing about a neighbour’s recent holiday. The party workers or activists don’t like anything about Blairism and are prepared to dump the whole sorry “third way” mumbo jumbo and move back a decade or five. And that is their problem.\nThe general voter understands that politics has moved on in the 21st century and they understand that a party which is reconfiguring itself to appeal to a no longer in existence industrial working class is slowly going to disappear. Whether it is being politically savvy or just the right person at the right time this explains Theresa Mays success. She appeals to the modern working class…..namely everyone except the overpaid and the political elite. The Labour party can still count on support from some but by no means all members of the “industrialised” public and pseudo public sector, like lawyers, but as activists go that is about it.\nThe Labour party under Corbyn also has the approval of the now unemployed second generation ex-industrial workers who account for much of disrespectfully described underclass. However, whilst this is a growing constituency the reality is that they are inactive politically and tend not to vote.\nSo, to the Labour Party, we say, stop blaming Corbyn. The only people who give a damn about the old labour movement support him even though he represents a near non-existent political constituency. Perversely it is the Conservatives who offer a listening ear to the working class of 21st century Britain not the Europhile Blairites with their sanctimonious and patronising political elitism. To the Blairites, we say “join the Conservatives” (if they will have you) and to the Corbynites, we say “come and join us…if you dare”.\nOh, just one final point if you should ever read this Jez please sack Emily Thornberry….according to our psychologist she represents no one, but herself.\n02.03.17 “Housing Crisis” or simply too much of the wrong provision in the wrong place and it costs too much!\nHousing is in crisis, so we are told. Yet the evidence of an actual “crisis” seems to be missing. If you look at who is housed, then most people who are working are housed and usually housed comfortably. If they want a home, there are homes out there ready for occupation. There are three-quarters of a million empty homes.\nIn the inner cities, landlords buy up homes and make them available for students and migrants. This, primes and sustains the market for new builds on the outskirts of towns. These are purchased by the new middle class of public servants and working couples who can move up and out of the town and city centres. As this market has evolved built on migrant workers and student indebtedness, so house price inflation becomes endemic. In the end house price inflation switches from being social negative to an economic positive becoming a means of driving other markets including the general consumer market via secured borrowing.\nTake away family breakdown, student debt and migrants and the market would go flat and then house prices would begin to fall. This would be good news for buyers and perhaps with a bit of negative equity for the current winners, ordinary working people, even shop workers might be able to afford to buy their own inner city or town centre property. A Blue Revolution would burst the housing bubble and get some sanity back into a market that is gamed by governments, landlords and the financial sector but denies poorer working people the chance to own their own home.\nThe current housing market is not adversely affected by a lack of supply but by high prices and a lack of affordable finance due to wages being too low to pay for the inflated house prices. It is simply not true that there are not enough homes. There are not enough affordable homes but building on green field and destroying the countryside will not solve the problem. It will not make houses more affordable. To solve the problem first understand it and then have the guts to tackle it comprehensively. That may mean improving family resilience, getting student numbers down, closing some academic institutions, and reducing inward migration via welfare reform. All now possible post-Brexit.\nJust like “Remain” itself there are vested interests at work to preserve the housing status quo. Whilst change is often unwelcomed it must not be avoided, we the working class need it if we are not to be further economically marginalised by being squeezed out of yet another market. The state claims to be able to address and fund markets in health, education, social care and housing for the low paid. They can’t and should not pretend they can. The days of state hyperbole needs to stop, and markets need to be made to work for the poor.\n05.03.17 We rip up the planet so some can get super-rich and the rest of us can buy “stuff” but what is the endgame and really what’s the point?\nIt doesn’t matter what problem the planet is facing, there is going to be some link to the behaviour of humans. Humans are the planet’s biggest threat and the biggest threat to harmonious human survival remains humans.\nIf the only way we can as a world “get on together” today, is to rape the planet of resources, we all have a long-term problem we are all currently very keen to ignore.\nWe at a Blue Revolution explore a possible “end game” for this destructive system. A sort of secular-westernism meets various types of mediaeval tribalism at a point when the planet can no longer sustain the current model for resourcing global peace. It does not look pretty but we offer a Blue Revolutionary alternative.\nThe western world is, whether we like it or not, slipping back into a form of market sustained feudalism. There are very rich and very rich people in the west who have got rich either by taking advantage of taxpayers via government spending or who have got rich by working the so-called free market. Basically, they are rich because poorer people have paid out for them to be rich. These rich people have no idea that their wealth is a form of theft or perhaps more pertinently, acquired by a form of deception. We at a Blue Revolution, unlike our Red counterparts, don’t see “the state” as part of the solution. The State is part of the problem.\nWith western billionaires basically acquiring the proceeds of the debt of others as their personal wealth, debt all too often acquired by the masses to purchase unnecessary “stuff”, the plant struggles with a surfeit of demand for resources. After the west add in the rest of the world who exploit their repressed people. The despots of the second and third world raid the earth’s resources for their personal wealth. Thus we have come to a point where the poor old planet is being stripped bare by the masses to meet the needs of rich people who either through political repression (China, Africa and Middle-East) or economic deception (the West) are getting “stinking rich”.\nThe end point for this is an economic and social collapse, perhaps better known as war. Let’s be honest who wants to change how we live our lives in the West to save the planet and our global stability in the long term. Because everyone sees this as a government responsibility and governments don’t want to “upset their regimes” or lose elections the climate conferences come up with nothing except fine words. We are ambivalent about man’s responsibility for climate change but the need to reduce production and consumption would be reflected in a reduction in carbon emissions. The problem is that the rules of economic determinism dictate that if it isn’t going to work economically within the existing growth paradigm, it isn’t going to happen at all. And so, it doesn’t.\nThe reason we should reduce aggregate demand, thus changing the paradigm, is because it is bad for the planet to consume so much and with ballooning middle classes in China and elsewhere, projected consumption is unsustainable. Debt is the way the foolish west tries to keep up with emerging economies, given the West’s relative loss of purchasing power within this growth-based system.\nSo how do you change a paradigm that everyone has, or everyone wants, and no one seems willing to change?\nWell to start with the west needs to lead a Blue Revolution, a revolution based on maintaining high levels of equality as well as lower levels of growth. In the UK we could start by hacking back at the class based public sector, reducing differentials in pay and giving no public servant more pay than the Prime Minister. This establishes the principle that equality is more important than wealth acquisition on very much a personal level. We would also get rid of any structure which simply creates well-paid tax-payer funded jobs such as much of the higher education sector.\nSecondly, we would make the relationship between people and the state “contractual” based on choice and consent. No unconditional anything. There would be obligations and responsibilities as well as the rights enshrined in Contract, Choice and Consent to drive responsible as opposed to childlike behaviour. This would start to reduce idleness and welfare dependence and put families back at the heart of the nation. The left wing will scream that this undermines the rights of the poor, but that is because they don’t understand Marxism.\nFinally, we would look at creating a welfare system based on social value. We would move away from a two thousand-year-old paradigm of wealth only being generated economically, to a system where social capital was valued too, maybe a form of national social service. Taken together these three approaches to economics should start to shift the paradigm into a more sustainable form fit for the future.\n06.03.17 If you are “living the dream” you are probably part of the nightmare!\nJust a quick one as we have covered the themes of wealth being linked to debt-based exploitation, but this sums it up well. Living the dream probably means that someone is either in debt or has been persuaded to part with cash that has its origins in government debt. It also means that the planet is being stressed by too much unnecessary western consumption, just as China and India et al wish to join the “living the dream” hegemony. “I am living the dream” begs the question, who’s dream is it really and is it not simply a long-term debt-based nightmare for someone packaged as your short-term dream.\n07.03.17 “let my daughter work” a mother’s plea on behalf of her disabled daughter. What is the Blue Revolutionary response?\nSomeone popped in and left a copy of “The Spectator” dated 4th March 2017 with us and asked us to consider an article by Rosa Monkton which was about her daughter Domenica who has a disability and the obstacles Domenica faced in the job market. We will carefully consider the issues and be back, however, we will be applying our revolutionary principles so won’t come back with a “third-way fudge”.\nIn primitive hand to mouth societies, the disabled were either stillborn or were taken away and buried alive. The reason is exactly the same reason that windows are abused in primitive societies or in even more primitive societies female infanticide is justified. It is because those groups are groups who contribute less economic and social value than they consume in resources. So in a primitive society, they are denied the right to fulfil their “species-essence” they are denied the right to life. Barbaric and it still goes on!\nIn primitive society, social value is essentially delivered by the female however where it is possible to do so “social value” can by synthesised in the form of the enforced compliance of the rules through brutality (it still goes on now in that ******** Saudi Arabia). So in such societies, you need fewer old women, therefore fewer girls and no people with a disability.\nNow the idiot left will have completely missed the point that Capitalism and Christianity accorded all of these groups a dignity which not only showed them compassion but also the ability to create and sustain social and economic value. A capitalist would pay an exploitation wage based on a person’s productivity. In effect, anyone could be a proletarian if a capitalist could exploit them, including the disabled.\nIn a Christian influenced society which has pushed beyond feudalism, everyone has a social and an economic value. Rose in “Upstairs Downstairs” (cultural reference alert) was a simple girl who washed up. She added social value to the crew downstairs and added, by playing her part in the household, to the economic value of the household overall. The Marxian would not miss the point that much of the household income was based on some form of exploitation or another, but the principle that all have a social and economic role can’t be ignored even by the modern liberal left.\nThe liberal left, however that group is defined, do not recognise the need for people to make any kind of social or economic contribution. They rely on the lazy disabled to be the voice of the disabled and shriek if anyone suggests that people in wheelchairs can actually, and should actually work rather than be “cared for”. The hated Blair tried to tackle this issue but having no base values (unlike a Blue Revolution) caved into the lazy lobby of the disabled left. The Tories are petrified of tackling the issue as the BBC and the Labour party will simply refresh their “nasty party” slogan for them. The Tories could counter it by calling Labour the Stupid party\nIn addition to leveraging the disabled out of work, the left has allowed a lazy army of second and third generation unemployed industrial workers to become not so much a “reserve army of labour”, as a reserve army of socially dependent idlers. This sums up the problem for our mother and daughter. The left likes idleness because it is sort of edgy “post-capitalist” and non-exploitative “caring” if you like. But of course, this is all bollocks. Being excluded and unable to fulfil any kind of species essence is exploitation of the most rank kind.\nThe left’s “system” does not want to see disabled people having to make mature work related choices based on their own assessment of their ability to contribute social or economic value. The secret of the left’s “progressive politics” is that a system paying to keep people idle is as far as they are concerned exploiting the hated capitalist, which of course is about one hundred years out of date. “Managing” the disabled also creates a caring army of state-funded workers so what is not to like if you are a liberal and left wing?\nWell in a world influenced by a Blue Revolution where we have broadly to contribute either social or economic value based on the concepts of contract, choice and consent Domenica should with her mother’s support find a way of choosing a job. This will involve contracting to employment which balances out her ability to create social and economic value with her unique needs. This may involve her choosing to opt out of the minimum wage. We are no longer a hand to mouth tribal economy so her talents can be utilised! It is not only her responsibility to contribute to society it is societies responsibility to ensure it happens wherever it can.\nThank God or thank social progress (Capitalism) for the fact we no longer kill our disabled children but there is no justice in inflicting on them some kind of state-funded living death.\nOh, and we don’t agree that the government should increase the NI contributions of the self-employed. The self-employed are not some kind of bourgeoisie thy are the foot soldiers of the Blue Revolution. Cut the cost of the class-based state by sacking “top people”. The self-employed are the kind of employers who would be happy to negotiate a reasonable wage for Domenica if they were allowed to do so.\n10.03.17 Grammars, why do the teaching profession hate the very idea?\nThe simple answer is we really don’t know, but it doesn’t matter what the teachers think it is clearly an issue that strikes at the heart of the teaching profession; if it didn’t they wouldn’t care. When something strikes at the heart of an ideology or profession it is usually met with hostility and derision. Just like Sir John Major and Blair as a result of Brexit, experiencing the kind of existential crisis inflicted on blue collar workers all over the western world, so teachers seem to be having some kind of existential angst about grammars.\nNow grammar schools are schools and teachers teach in schools, so it is not a full-on existential crisis. We at Blue Revolution could argue that some children with the self-discipline and academic aptitude could be better taught at home remotely in “virtual grammars”; now that is existential for teachers. But that is not being promoted by the UK government. Now we believe the teaching profession has been able to excuse poor results in schools by relying on the poor quality of the students. Grammars will encourage and stream out of comps a mixture of young academic children including those who want to excel and this might highlight just how poor the rest of the children are. Take the academic kids out of the comp and those children that are left will not deliver the results the teachers need to promote their profession. It will be clear teaching is not what drives academic or any other ability it is the stuff the left wing deny has relevance such as stable families, good parenting, love and kindness….only some of it in the armoury of the teaching profession but everything the liberal left has undermined and is now in denial about.\nNow we understand that academic failure is not really due to teachers it is due to society producing kids who lack the aptitude, self-discipline and interest in learning and this is a long-term challenge for the state (no not state. The country and its people. Ed)which we believe only a Blue Revolution can correct. Kids failing to achieve in comps, however, is not a reason to abandon the idea of grammars. Our only observation about selection is that selection must not be based on a quiz or some obscure test of intelligence, it must be based on spelling, and maths with a little bit of modern foreign languages to identify the children who are marginal or where there is over subscription and too many passes.\nTeachers need to get over themselves and support grammars and accept the limits of their involvement with the children they teach. They are not and never have been the cause of poor academic performance. The Government too needs to change tack and stop seeing teachers as the cure for the army of under-performing, fertile, angry and idle young people “welfare” has created over the last twenty years or so.\n12.03.17 There are no utopias unless you are lucky enough for “the system” to create one for you. How does that happen ?\nUtopia. Thomas More’s ideal society which saw simplicity and eschewing wealth as the hallmarks of the good society. In such a world people would avoid wealth and the “utopia” was an internal one. It existed in the heads of the people. This is not the “Utopia” of the world post-socialism…, particularly Blair’s post third-way socialism. Socialism might have been a necessary phase in human evolution but it leaves a legacy of money grubbing utopianism enshrined in organisations like the EU.\nThere are many ways to create Utopia for yourself, it has to involve money of course, but whilst we can look at Blair’s personal Utopia we can look at some Utopias the seeds of which were sown in the period after the landslide win of the New Labour in 1997.\nThe first Utopia we will consider is the lawyers “Utopia” created by the Human Rights Act and which in the hands of oh so clever “human rights” lawyers can transform tax payers cash into personal fortunes whilst little gain is made by society at large. The lawyer’s and Judges talk of “proportionality” and “necessity” unless of course, it relates to money grubbing opportunities for themselves. From squaddies to prison staff from social workers to police officers it is now possible thanks to lawyers to find oneself in the madness of a Kafkaesque legal pantomime. Lawyers can trap you with “ill motivation” but then if you miss something and someone is harmed you can be accused of “denying their human rights”. The lawyers have nailed this with their ruling today that victims of poor police investigations have had their human rights violated, and yet the police officer who gets it wrong the other way and is seen as overzealous is embroiled in litigation by the lawyers too. Lawyers have thanks to Blair created their own utopia. The world for them is one of irresponsible money making, waffle and highfalutin and very lucrative legal nonsense. This shameful lawyers utopia needs to be brought to and end. The public will end the bullying of rank and file public sector staff by a bewigged swaggering cabal of mercenaries. We the British public know what they are up to and we will in time bring their collusion and indifference to real suffering to an end. You have been advised.\nThe second “Utopia” is the one occupied by the liberal elite and the top end of the public sector class system. Marx as we often state referred to species essence. Maslow refined this to “self-actualization”. The Proletarian could not self-actualise playing their small part in the capitalist’s production machine and the petit bourgeoisie had to act in the interests of the Capitalist masters. Not much self-actualising in that.\nHowever today the petit bourgeoisie (unique in that there is no longer a proper bourgeoisie) among whom are the Civil Servants, Chief Executives, heads of quango’s and politicians, can self-actualize by managing the British public or their rank and file staff. Just like painting or self-expression through performance art, these people thrive by organising and engineering our lives in a way which we, the tax paying public, resent.\nWe resent it because it clearly makes them so happy and smug doing it and of course it is without real responsibility (We still carry that, see above). This activity adds little of value to our lives whilst we have to pay them for their pleasure via our taxes or compliance with their “policies”. Until we bring this class to heel and make them act on our behalf they will continue to destroy our lives, society and our economy whilst maintaining their own lucrative little utopia.\n14.03.17 A bit Utopian the last post or so some people think… but only for some. Any other utopians out there and who isn’t living the utopian dream?\nThe last post highlighted two winners of the British publicsectocracy, lawyers and the liberal elite. However, it was pointed out that there must be others so ignoring the elites of the NHS and others we regularly refer to we will consider those at the bottom of the social pile and those in the middle. Firstly we don’t want to penalise the poor or those on benefits. The problem they face shouldn’t be financial they are moral. The utopia the elites have created for the unemployed, “out of workers” is corrosive to the aspirations of the whole country. Welfare in the form of benefits within the existing framework be they generous final salary government pensions or unemployment benefits are good for no one.\nIn the case of the former group the pensioners, they have a lifestyle which has benefitted from the gentle inflation of the economy and the expansion of the public sector which occurred after the second world war. They are able to travel abroad, have retired early and had a lifestyle unencumbered by in many cases any kind of multi-generational caring as this has been “industrialised” by the state. They have benefits too all paid for by the British struggling to keep the state afloat “working classes”. The state needs to look after this group as they vote….unlike our next “utopians” the idle second and third generation ex-industrial and agricultural workers. This group it is fair to say have been created by mighty global forces which have either given their work to the Chinese or in the case of the others their jobs have been done more flexibly by an army of migrants on zero hour contracts.\nThese changes have led this benighted group to find comfort in the only activity the state is prepared to celebrate unquestioningly with tax payers cash…having babies (and all that is pleasurable about the process of making them). The state likes “industrialising” things and childcare outside of committed relationships has grown to support an army of state employees too many of whom operate at the level of our “public sector elite”.\nSo who are the losers of the system, and what about the Sir Philip Greens of this world. Well, Sir Phil does not create his own “utopia” unlike the others above he can, and his type often do, crash and burn. For the moment the others above have a system which keeps their positions fairly guaranteed and each depends upon the other groups to maintain their position. The single parents need the state and the state needs to keep an army of workers to protect them and lawyers to uphold their human, welfare and reproductive rights. The pensioners too need the state and state need them as they vote.\nSo who is left, who are the people looking in on this feudal liike system of state remunerated utopians? From political or legal overlord to unemployed single parent the requirement to work for average wages is all to often avoided by status or illness. So the people who service this utopia are the ordinary workers and taxpayers those who can’t or morally won’t avoid work and have to do it for a modest return.\nThe nonutopian’s are therefore the self-employed the low waged and the public sector “tactical” or “operational” staff. These are the people who seem to end up in court for some trumped up “human rights” infringement. Of all the non-utopians the ones we feel the most sympathy for are the tactical public sector staff. They have to deal with the utopians, including the lawyers and their “letters before claim” and their basically spurious legal cases. They have to be insulted and abused by self-centred management who glide around public sector HQ’s on 100+k salaries taking no responsibility for anything but demanding KPI’s are hit or there will be cuts. And more importantly, they have to deal with Britain’s appalling, entitled and strangely angry general public, oh and their kids.\nTo the police officers, nurses, teachers, social workers, traffic wardens, jobcentre staff, soldiers etc as well as the shop and factory workers and the self-employed we salute you. If anyone has to be “given a break” it is you. The state needs massive cost cutting so it needs to come from the places where there is the most “fat”. It needs to come from the utopians. Challenging the utopians is not a threat to liberal democracy…….it is an expression of liberal democracy.\n16.03.17 OMG Post truth Campbell tries to stir up anxiety and counter revolution over Bexit. W\nAlastair Campbell that supporter of the dodgy dossier and the war in Iraq….all pre, post-truth “post-truth”? has now decided to support the venerable Lord Heseltine on the subject of Remain. As you would expect it is all gloom and doom, young graduates fearful for their future, delusional proles lied to by post-truth Tory scum and “kippers” all a scheming and a manipulating and it will all of course end in disaster. We agree it will all end in disaster, a disaster for the ranks of the EU superannuated Remainers and their kith and kin. The so-called “Brextreamists” among us should be proud.\nThe Brextreamists have had the foresight and the vision to recognise that the EU was simply a gravy train for Tone, Campbell, Heseltine and ranks of other elites from all sides of the political spectrum hobnobbing with elites from all over the globe and their kith and kin. We don’t want to “bang on about Europe” but whilst there may be some “adjustment” as we leave the soporific EU and once again become a fully grown up member of the world community assisting the world with our global trade links, the world community will gain productively, democratically and economically from Brexit.\nAll this positivity rather than like the EU elites, taking full economic advantage of the fellow elites of the oil, mineral and gem rich feudal states of the African continent and Middle-East whilst between them casting the poor of the African, Middle East and Asian continents into poverty and starvation by refusing to trade properly with them.\nCampbell and his ilk need to be put into the dustbin of history. Bring on the revolution!\n19.03.07 When a Judge is roundly attacked for commenting critically on drunk young women we ask: what drives third wave feminism?\nFirst wave feminists demanded rights, second-wave feminists demanded equality, and third wave feminists demand whatever they damn well like, and they expect to get it too! So, what drives feminism?\nFrom an economic determinist position, it seems fairly clear to us that few have bothered to look critically at feminism and what drives the modern feminist agenda. This is probably for good reason, as one often comes out on the wrong side of the argument, particularly when the discussions are held online. Many people that dare speak out often endure abuse and allegations of misogyny, even when the protagonist is a woman!\nWe explain the correlation between the progress of the economy and decline of social values by examining what has driven the march of feminism over the last three hundred years. In the period before capitalism, the state would have had no acceptance of women demanding rights of any sort – the hierarchy of the church and state meant that men, as well as women, had limited scope to exercise freedom and choice. During this period, contract and consent began to influence economic behaviour and social activities. Once the concepts of contract choice and consent had entered the economic world these principles were soon demanded by a growing number of excluded members of society – so that they too may benefit from these three then radical but linked principles – principles upon which the bourgeoisie ran the economy and set its social principles.\nOnce contract, choice and consent were out of the economic bag so to speak, it would have been naive not to have expected demand for their extension to other economic groups. It thus began with the early 19th century Reform Acts which conferred the right for working men to vote. It was also fairly obvious that with working men getting the vote, middle and upper middle-class women would demand it too. The Pankhurst family and the Suffragettes were the trailblazers for first wave feminism – they were not interested in equality at this point, but they were demanding the same rights as men, and specifically the right to help choose the government so it was a government of consent for women too.\nWith the rise of socialism and the growing discontent of the “capitalist class”, the movement towards “equality” was well under way through “socialism”. Firstly for men – this was the rise of the “them and us” industrial relations of the factory, mine and yard. This phase culminated, after the second world war, with so-called “public ownership” of the means of production; railways, steel works, car manufacturing companies and many other industries. These industries were gradually gobbled up by the state. The whole concept of equality between the workers and the capitalist was then established, as theoretically the workers and the people now owned these industries. However, women were still paid less than men in these industries. The reality was that there continued to be inequality, the boardroom and the shop floor were and to some extent still are, worlds apart.\nBack to feminism. The feminists at this point had to challenge the many inequalities of the factory floor. Women in work during this era had to endure the inequality of pay which saw many skilled women, in many cases, receiving lower pay than an unskilled man. The women of the Dagenham factory in the late 1960’s for example saw the Unions and Bosses essentially “stitch” the female workers up, by increasing male wages by freezing female wages! Second wave feminists had their work cut out -just like their first wave sisters. The male working class were clearly of little help to the second wave sisterhood. In the end, the women won, but not before correcting wage level imbalances between men and women, resulted in the closure of plants. Once women had wage equality it was indisputable that employment equality would naturally follow, leading to women holding positions such as Bishops, airline pilots, surgeons etc, and rightly so.\nSo far so good, but for feminism, it didn’t stop there. From this point evolved an opportunity for a third wave feminism to develop its distinctive character. The birth of third wave feminism seems to have its origins in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s – which for economic determinists coincides with the final collapse of western capitalism – Western capitalism then mutated into the “free market”. Now, the free market is just about as unhinged as anything can get; it is debt based relying on the over inflation of certain markets (property, art and stock markets for example) and is totally unsustainable in the long term for both individual countries and the planet at large.\nHowever, what it has done is turn subject and citizen into “consumer” and this is where the third wave feminist enters the story. The third wave is, like its first and second wave, simply a product of the economic system and the opportunities the system does or doesn’t create. The third wave thus reflects the “free markets” desire to commodify everything for consumption including men, women and sex. The basis for the “free market” is not what you can produce (social or economic value) but what you can consume. Thus a scantily clad drunk young woman is exercising her right in the free market to consume as she likes and to maximise her power of consumption perhaps by attracting an equally drunk mate?\nIt also reflects the fact that women – particularly young attractive women have become self-objectifying “products” available to be consumed. However, this process is turned into “girl power” by the theologians of the third wave, unless of course, the consumer is unwelcome. In this situation it becomes sinister. But this is a bit like a trades person saying “why have you asked me to fix your car…I might call myself a mechanic, look like a mechanic, talk like a mechanic but in your case, I am not a mechanic. It might be better if one didn’t offer the services of a mechanic in the first place!\nIn any other phase of history, the lack of good public behaviour would be an issue of public concern (as it still is for male drunkenness) but as the Judge found in a recent widely publicised case, when it comes to a third wave feminist commenting on a “sister” maximising her opportunities to consume by whatever means at her disposal, no one, not even a retiring female judge is allowed to disagree with this behaviour!\nThe problem for the Judge here is that she can really only criticise or be seen to criticise. A grounded set of principles like Blue Revolution’s Contract, Choice and Consent would clearly highlight the recklessness associated with public drunkenness. When drunk you can’t choose, or consent, and indeed contracting is out of the question…by law in fact. So, when a drunk of whatever gender gets themselves into serious trouble it should be seen as a failure of due diligence on their part. The community, the police, and the courts are forced to pick up the pieces of this reckless type of behaviour. These processes don’t come cheap for the taxpayer either! It is our view that people of whatever gender when criticised for being drunk in public should not be defended. The whole issue is about mature responsible behaviour, not feminism.\n06.04.17 Why Ken Livingstone represents the danger at the heart of the British left wing\nSome years ago we commented on the danger of the new resurgent British left wing as it grew in strength under the leadership of the “useful idiot” Jeremy Corbyn. When we say “left” we don’t mean the Blairites who are, like Blair himself, just sanctimonious Tories, we mean the ragtag and bobtail collection of people who support “minority causes” with violent enthusiasm. Many of these minority causes from race to class would clash if anyone was interested in opening the whole sorry mess up to some kind of scrutiny. However, the left fall silent and the centre right like the teacher with a kipper stapled under their chair really does not understand where the smell is coming from. Let us help!\nWe warned that the Jewish community, women and the whole identity lobby were not safe within Labour. Ken Livingstone provides us with the perfect opportunity to explain why and also why any liberally minded hard left campaigner should support the Blue Revolution. Ken as we will recall suggested that Hitler was a Zionist because Hitler wanted the State of Israel. This is on the face of it a banal observation, lazy and ill-informed, but it speaks to a constituency of the hard left who would gain strength from this assertion, particularly those with Palestinian sympathies.\nHowever what is wrong with Ken’s comment is that it betrays his total failure to understand the concepts of choice and consent in western culture. Like Hitler, Ken and much of the hard left does not recognise the rights of individuals to Contract, Choose and Consent. Go to any “hard left” rally and you will hear the language of force, control and coercion, just like Hitler would have used to get Jewish citizens into his “State of Israel” as described by Ken.\nThe left wing behaves as though capitalism had never bestowed vital liberal rights on to people before its predictable collapse into the unpredictable and ridiculously unsustainable “free market”. So what we have with the hard left is an enthusiasm for ignoring the liberal benefits of capitalism as they adopt an almost feudal authoritarianism over individuals.\nWith people like Ken and his collection of useful idiots like Jez, women, gays, Jewish people, in fact, all of us should worry about our rights, including human rights under a hard left government….because without a respect for Contract, Choice and Consent they really don’t understand “rights” at all, and like Ken they don’t seem to want to.\n21.May 17 The Saudi paradox and the west’s dilemma V2\nSaudi Arabia is a paradox. A wholly 21st-century country which practices a form of orthodox Islam that would not be out of place in the 10th century. The differences between then and now are obviously technological as opposed to theological. Rights are limited, women have few at all to speak of. Cruel and humiliating death is meted out for a range of crimes most westerners practice on a regular basis. So what do we make of the west’s dalliance with the Saudis’ and how should it play out over time?\nWell firstly understand the nature of the Saudi culture and why it is so repressive. It is what we have called ‘dustbowl Islam’ a strict form of Islam which in earlier times was necessary to keep society safe and coherent. However, this form of Islam is repressive and without the ability to fund its museum piece culture from oil revenues, Saudi culture would have been forced to reform. Nowhere on the planet has Islam become so conservative and even Iran knows that evolution is necessary for survival. So the first point about Saudi is that oil reserves preserve an antiquated culture that without oil would be extinct.\nThe second thing to understand about Saudi and all oppressive cultures is that they have generally not gone through a process of industrial revolution. Industrialisation needs to be based on contract, choice and consent or it doesn’t work and this is all upheld by the rule of civil law. Saudi does not recognise the universal right to contract, choice and consent like many oppressive regimes your gender, rank and title determines your rights or your oppression. This is what makes them different to us and makes them uphold their culture aggressively using their oil money. They don’t understand the concept of universal rights for women, the gay community etc people for whom the rights demanded by capitalism have been extended over the last two hundred years. It would be a good idea for the west to at least acknowledge that their ally is culturally centuries behind being liberal in any modern post-capitalist sense.\nFinally, once we can understand the origins and accept the limits of Saudi culture we should consider the double helix of Saudi cooperation in tackling extremism. A ruling elite who are essentially ripping off the people with the connivance of the infidel and indulging in non-Islamic behaviour be that playboy behaviour in London or contracting for arms with the west are not in the true sense of the term orthodox Muslim, regardless of how many mosques they build in the west. So the culture the Saudi regime upholds on a social level they also undermine on a political and economic level. They help the west defeat ISIS but inspire ISIS too. The west will continue to sell the Saudi Arabians arms and will ignore human rights abuses but should publicly in the west at least be clear exactly why Saudi is as it is, and why, because of that we have to tolerate their illiberal behaviour. This is necessary because when the oil runs out the Saudi regime collapses the only thing left to export will be the culture and it won’t be sold to us it may well be inflicted on us if you get our meaning. Better to start to question it now rather than be seen to endorse it.\nWe are also posting on ABlueRevolution.org\n24.05.17 In the wake of the Manchester tragedy the issue of “Islam” re surfaces again. How should we proceed?\nIslam is a faith which has not been through a reformation as we are told on a regular basis. The suggestion is that when this happens it will be cleansed of all it’s more abhorrent characteristics such as prejudice against non-believers and discrimination against women and gays etc. However, this reformation is unlikely to happen on a scale that reflects the task needed. The reason for this is simple industrialisation has been and gone. The Christian reformation was a movement which demanded that individuals could progress economically with God’s blessing rather than sitting around at whatever position in the feudal or catholic hierarchy they were placed. The process was as much economic as it was theological. Eventually, the capitalist juggernaut caught everyone in its slipstream and transformation of society was imposed on everyone. To make capitalism work the law needed to move into managing commercial relationships and so Contract, Choice and Consent became the three legs upon which the system worked, upheld by parliament and the courts.\nNow the Islamic “reformation” will not happen on this scale. The reformation for all faiths and none has been and gone. But reformation will happen within the minds of individuals who are able to make their way in western society and appreciate the positive effects of Contract, Choice and Consent on society at large. Contract, Choice and Consent are the legacy of the reformation and its capitalisation during the industrial revolution. The rights people have today are owed to them, first by capitalism and then by politicians extending them to more and more groups. This goes right up to recent gay marriage legislation and designing your own sexual identity.\nNow it will become commonplace to hear that the perpetrator of an ‘Islamist’ inspired atrocity is ‘troubled’ ‘failed’ or ‘dropped out’. Because these individuals won’t have been caught in the western world’s aftermath of the reformation juggernaut. Culturally they are different. They will firstly not accept Contract Choice and Consent for people in general and will identify themselves as different from those of us who do accept Contract, Choice and Consent as the basis of a free society. These people are going to be with us for a long time. Islamism is a creed practised with the blessing of the West in Sudi Arabia and which was little understood by those prosecuting instability agendas across the Middle East.\nSo we have to brace ourselves for more threats to our safety. However if we understand that Islamism is hostile to rights and in particular the rights for all, women, men, gay people, people of all faiths and none to choose their own lifestyle based on Contract, Choice and Consent at least as a society we can be better equipped to spot those who might be more of a risk from those who are absorbing and accepting some of the rights as laid down hundreds of years ago by our reformation and the birth of capitalism. It should also inform us about how we understand the cultures of the Middle East so we are promoting trade rather than dependency and migration.",

At Blue Revolution we believe our elected members would speak only for you and you should vote for them, not the party they serve or, the party that serves them.\nHow many times have we as voters seen politicians “tow the party line” against the interests of ordinary people. Nationally, our entry into the EU, tuition fees, the outsourcing of services, the use of debt to maintain services and the exporting of jobs are classic examples of political actions linked to vested interests. Locally we have poor public services, litter-strewn streets and rural isolation. This type of politics happens because people did not have enough of a say in how policy is formed and delivered. Parties we are told know better……we believe that is utter rubbish.\nAt Blue Revolution, we believe that your problems are our problems. We will be similar in our experiences of life our modest ambitions and frustrations, so we can represent you better than someone putting their party before you. As they do……it’s all anger from the left and inaction from the right!\nPlease support your Blue Revolution candidate.\nPublished by Mike Gilbert on behalf of Blue Revolution both of 22 Tower Street Boston PE21 8RX",

They are the power holders, politicians mainly, but operating with an agenda, and in an environment which differs depending on the economic realities they have both created and promote. In post-Blair Britain, the “free market” characterised by naked greed was used to create a debt-based environment which promoted and paid for a corrosive form of socialism that has left Britain massively indebted to the banks and racked with social and economic problems such as family breakdown, health and social care crises. The huge wage differentials in the UK giving the lie to any pretence the aim was to try to reduce inequality rather than make certain “friends” of the Blair establishment rich.\nIn the US the people call Hilary Clinton a “crook”. She is the stateside version of the Blair economic phenomenon, except in the US they have the constitution which allows such comments to be expressed openly. They probably can’t say why she is a “crook”, she probably isn’t a “Crook” in the accepted sense of the term but she has done well on the debt of the nation and the American people. In the western economic model it’s OK to make money like this………but to us at a Blue Revolution this is the heart of the problem no it’s not OK to skim the economy and its people to very generously line the pockets of the few whilst using some tax from debt based wealth and some government borrowing to pay welfare to the amoral “underclass”.\nThe lawyers, particularly that brand of left wing sanctimonious bureaucratic parasite that feeds off the processing errors of poorly paid “operational” public servants (but is happy to proclaim Blair free of any misfeasance for “war-related atrocities”) are also recipients, but generous recipients of government spending this time.\nIn too many respects the “feelings” Americans have about Clinton reflect the “feelings” most Britains have about Blair and lawyer Mrs Blair. But here he has created an industry to look after his interests and the interests of the Establishment and its hangers on like our Human Rights lawyers, other friendly publicsectorcrats, and oh Phillip Green et al.\nSo what of the FA the NHS and the BMA. Well, these latter two represent the top of the Public Sector employees, crown princes and princesses of the publicsectocracy. Like big media organisations, they create a monopoly for certain public sector roles and thereby they can drive up wages by bullying the government and patients. The media organisations play a similar conjuring trick with football. A man who can kick a ball gets paid more in a week than some people earn in a lifetime. The money comes from media companies who hold the sports viewng public over a financial barrel.\nSo what is the Blue Revolutionary answer; well we find it hard to come up with one. The mischief could be corrected if there was a model of payment for services (medical payments, footballers wages, being a celebrity etc) which better reflects the public’s actual willingness to pay for the medical intervention, football match and celebrity. Authors and musicians are a good example of how to some extent the market works…until TV and Film Corporations start their wage distorting and inflating activities.\nHow improvement is achieved we don’t fully know but we are honest about that. It requires a shift at every social level and perhaps it needs people to “collectivise” their viewing (Sharing TV and on-line) and stop getting into debt to go to the football. The role of the Government in medicine makes it difficult to imagine how this particular barrel can be got over. One option would be to give “Health vouchers” to people but that would require a fifty-year programme of getting people once again to take responsibility for their health. Being unhealthy has been too easy for too long!\n03.09.16 Selective education, bias and middle class angst; how to square the circle. V2\nAs anyone who reads this blog will know we have a particular take on economics and social evolution and so don’t subscribe to the usual “lefty” causes of equality…….blah blah blah. The reality is we are not born the same and we are not going to die the same. However, it is important for the health of any society that it allows its citizens to achieve what they are capable of achieving, to promote the collective good. This is not achieved by promoting the corrosive values of greed or the laughably inept strategy of government meddling or social engineering apropos Blair et al.\nSociety is a little like a kettle on a trivet, with each leg of the trivet being one of Capitalism’s legacy values of Contract, Choice, and Consent. The Kettle can happily bubble away with the minimum of fuss as long as someone is topping it up with water and ensuring the trivet is strong enough to hold the kettle. Destabilise the trivet and the kettle like society will tip.\nSo when we explore the issue of selective education of which we tend to agree is a good thing, we need to ensure that it is delivered in a way which allows as many people as possible to feel that they have enjoyed the same levels of Contract, Choice, and Consent as everyone else. We don’t want our trivet to tip over and spill the contents of the kettle because only some people can realistically consent to selection and then choose a grammar school based upon irrelevant factors related to a child’s ability such as class, rurality, nationality, or any other bogus criteria.\nWe have at a Blue Revolution some people who have experience in the field of education and they will tell anyone who is interested that whilst selection to identify academic ability is good, the eleven plus is bad. The eleven plus identifies children who have parents have schooled them in passing the eleven plus. Whether it is verbal or non-verbal reasoning tests, a child can quickly learn to spot the pattern and very soon can be proficient in “the test”. Middle-class parents can also afford to buy the practice papers and can coach their children to ensure that they stand a better chance of passing the eleven plus than children who have parents unable to purchase the papers or indeed understand the point of them.The result of “coaching is that academic children miss out to those who can “pass the test” and grammar schools have too many children who would have benefitted prom a less pressurise non-grammar school education.\nSo from a Blue Revolution and as usual based on discussion and we believe common sense a cheap solution to the complex problem of making the selection of children at 11 to 13 fairer and less class determined.\nFirstly any test has to be based on actual arithmetic and the technical knowledge of skills in literacy. The days when tests such a non-verbal reasoning tests were considered to indicate anything of relevance to learning should by now be long gone. A simple benchmark could be used such as spelling age and skills based around the manipulation of numbers or the times-tables. This simple methodology could test children up to A level standard at the age of between 11 and 13 and for those who had clear proficiency well above the average, a selective education will almost certainly be appropriate. The benefits of this model are threefold.\n- It will be understood by all parents of whatever ability themselves. Most people know what maths involves even if they can’t do it. So testing will not be based on obscurities that only the privileged can get access to. It will also mean that mums and dads from poorer backgrounds will know what is measured during selection and may be able to access grandparents or neighbours to help upskill and encourage their children.\n- It doesn’t require “coaching” any child can as the author Julie Birchill once; did sit in the library on their own practicing the skills necessary to get through the 11 to 13 plus.\n- it doesn’t have to be complicated and can be delivered in a large hall with the questions given verbally. To add a further dimension simple questions based on a modern foreign language could be introduced as could a short essay.\nAll in all, we feel that or 11 to 13 test would lay down a benchmark for the child to evidence aptitude. The exam could be done at any time between the ages of 11 and 13 and builds on actual skills learn in the preceding years at school and at home but more importantly allows the child to us the skills measured to develop their aptitude in core curriculum subjects.\nChildren who pass these exams will be known to their peers, and the parents of their peers, as children who had love, stability, and encouragement from birth to the day they passed the test…….if indeed with all that they actually pass it.\n05.09.16 Global disapproval for Brexit and a perplexing lack of vision from the Brexiteers. Are they loosing their bottle?\nWell, who knows what is going in the world of the Brexit office. Lofty aspiration is not only appropriate it is essential when one is attempting to sway the world towards trade and away from national self-interest and the ever-present possibility of war. The EU which quite wrongly sees itself as an agent of long-term peace and prosperity is also wrongly seen by the world’s biggest economies as a body with whom they can do business. Again in theoretical terms of volume of people represented and thus simplicity yes the EU looks a good bet; but what is the chance of any one country negotiating a deal with the EU which satisfies all 27 countries of the EU. We believe that President Obama’s optimism is rather misplaced.\nWhat is less in doubt, is the vexed question of the UK’s access to the single market upon which it is reasonable to assume businesses based in the UK rely. This unfettered access is very important and would be a loss to the UK if it were not part of a renegotiated settlement. The problem for the Department of Brexit is that by continuing the claim that Brexit was solely about migration it has kept this, the most unedifying aspect of Brexit in the public domain, and therefore a part of the UK EU negotiation.\nPost-referendum, the emphasis should have shifted to sovereignty and world free trade neither of which were possible within the EU and allied to these two mischiefs we have the pointlessness of the EU parliament and much of its non-trade related commission. These latter institutions have strayed too far from the politics of global free trade and now having taken world free trade about as far as they are capable of taking it; have turned their attention to “social and political” integration. This is the mischief at the heart of the EU and it is a mischief that The UK was first to identify and act to deal with. Much was stirred into the debate on both sides which presented Brexit as about borders and immigration and to some extent it is. However, as economic and material determinists we at a Blue Revolution accept that a fundamental principle of free trade should (wherever possible) involve a degree of free movement of workers. Please note we refer to “free movement” of “Workers”. Workers are factors of production they are “economic” in character. “People” are part of a political process; an EU inspired unification process which few if any countries in the EU really want. Indeed if the EU elites want unification like the UK elites seem to want (Blair et al) one can assume with some certainty that their citizens don’t or won’t.\nSo where does this leave the Brexit Department? Well, firstly we believe that there needs to be a restatement that Britain both wants to remain as part of the free market and that more importantly, it understands the nature of the EU project and rejects its federalist and integrationist agenda and all the flummery that goes with it (commissions, courts, parliaments etc). Britain needs to explain that controlling immigration is not just about setting up an expensive buraucracy (points based system) and border control but about identifying the obstacles to getting British people into British jobs and getting qualified people from overseas (all countries not just EU) into vacancies to ensure the economy continues to operate effectively. On this basis, as we have always said, the problem is about welfare and the distorting effects of welfare on the labour market, both the UK and EU labour markets. Put simply get British people back to work and, more importantly, don’t accept the concept of free movement of people by offering welfare to EU workers and their families, simply\nPut simply get British people back to work via welfare reform and, more importantly, don’t accept the concept of free movement of people. Free movement of workers is as far as any country needs to go to fulfil its free trade treaty obligations. By offering welfare to EU workers and their families, rather than simply work to those migrants the UK simply encourages a level of free movement which creates the pressures that trigger public dissatisfaction. Firms should be licensed to manage the process of recruiting workers on the basis that they benefit from migration and should bear the cost and take the responsibility for them whilst they are here.\nWe still pay welfare to EU migrant workers. This should stop as part of an initial Brexit broadside to assuage public impatience and if it delivers a reduction in net migration we can review how far we need to go implementing a policy that could in theory ratchet right up to full border control. The world needs a model for the movement of workers in a globalised world. Britain needs to trial one!\n10.09.16 A Blue Revolution is a Moral revival; with a sensible approach to Grammar schools now on the agenda; where next?\nIt is amazing how the “happy clappy left” unwittingly become the foot soldiers of the elite by arguing that somehow grammar schools promote social division. Social division is a social reality and it is only members of the utopian Corbyn supporters club who think that children’s differences in ability, aptitude, drive, determination and areas of personal interest be those interests reading, maths, cars, Star Wars or simply having fun on social media can be corrected by social engineering. These are the differences that determine outcomes at every level of society. The lazy businessman reliant on post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory will wait until the banks or governments generate demand through debt rather than getting out and developing new markets. His company will fail in the face of hungry foreign competition. He will have failed the business 11+.\nHowever in the case of children it is absolutely wrong that the child who approaches a sensible test of ability (based on real stuff; reading, writing spelling, times tables, etc. rather than “intelligence tests” which test skill at doing tests as we have said before) should be disadvantaged by their class, their location, the ideology of their school or indeed the quality of their parenting.\nAt a Blue Revolution we are not really interventionists believing that social and economic value should be created by human activity and that even if “unemployed” in the economic sense, the pro-social citizen will be aware that they have an indirect economic role by being socially active creating a stable community within which the economically active can operate. We are interdependent if you will. If Mrs Thatcher had not said “there is no such thing as society” but had said instead “there is no such thing as government engineered society, there are simply individuals who are inter-dependent on each other”, she would not have become the left’s bogeywoman. The Blue Revolution may not have slid backwards by three decades under the social svengali and economic illiterate Tony Blair.\nIt is, therefore, clear to us that society has a role in creating opportunities for children, opportunities to get a demanding education which demands more from them than the average comprehensive education would. Some children and we agree only a small number thrive on this pressure. Who are these children…….well currently they are the children of the better off; or the less well off but from loving families; and therein lies the problem. The children who will have the social “foundation” to do well is also small. Most children are now products of insecure relationships, family breakdown, or indeed welfare babies “bred” for the access they give to the welfare system. The “system” does not identify these “families” our guess is for fear of exposing a social moral crisis.\nSo whilst we have finally got “grammars” talked about again as a way of meeting the needs of ordinary hard working academically enthusiastic children, we have a legacy of social decline which undermines the opportunities for children born into socially unfavourable environments. The “happy clappy left”are right about that. The answer, however, is not to throw money at the parents, it is to access the social value currently locked into the community.\nSo to make the whole life experience of children better and to increase the chances of becoming “Top People” in the public sector as well as a new “Beatles” or world-class lawyers and engineers we need to stop the moral decline at the bottom of society and reverse the trend for children to be brought up or brought into the world for reasons other than “love”.\nWhilst this sounds as utopian as a Corbyn economic five-year plan it would be possible if we started to see government promoting social health and started to stir the army of decent people who have become economically marginal but who can promote the kind of values children need if they are to achieve their full social and economic potential. We are talking about grandparents, neighbours, volunteers, and if necessary foster parents. At the lower end of the social hierarchy, the capacity of parents needs to be evaluated and their capacity to offer children a range of life chances assessed. If the parent is (like too many) anti-social, incompetent of simply a welfare womb for hire by a predatory “shagger” then the community needs to step in and the child fostered by one of an army of newly recruited foster carers.\nChilden are not just there to be fed and watered and the child care system should not be limited to making sure children won’t come to physical harm. We have enough economically marginal people who have solid values who should be called upon to help the government fight the war against long-term social and moral decline. We need an army of paid foster carers now.\n14.09.16 Post neo-classical endogenous growth theory; the riddle of the west revealed. Or at least debtamorphosis explained. V3\nPost neo-classical endogenous growth theory; the riddle of western economies revealed. Or at least debtamorphosis explained. We were reminded of this comical if somewhat pretentious bit of 1980’s phraseology a couple of weeks ago when someone was quoting Gordon Brown and his laughable “end of boom and bust” claim in the early days of optimism following the landslide election of New Labour in 1997. We understand neo-classical economics to be essentially what came to be known as Keynesianism. Keynesianism was a 20th-century interventionist economic theory which was intended to stimulate or engineer economic growth during periods of economic recession. In the hands of a prudent government saving in good times and spending in bad times and within a closed economy where the extra spent stayed in the economy and didn’t flow abroad, it would stimulate growth. It would, of course, have to be spent in a skilled environment, no point in trying to stimulate growth in an economy with no capacity to grow.\nPost-neo-classical endogenous growth theory then must be a re-engineering of Keynesianism but must owe something to the old theory. In essence, the similarity is the spending to stimulate the necessary growth. The problem is that in the absence of investment money saved, the money spent has to be borrowed. This makes the model very different from its neo-classical forebears. However, to make the model credible it had to use re-engineered terms like using “investment” for “borrowing and spending”. Economic growth became a function of “consumer confidence”. The whole model was intended to ensure aggregate demand was maintained as this was seen as the key to securing economic growth. Still with us?\nOk, alongside the new model there was a need to skill up the workforce; hence the “education,education, education” claim by Tony Blair. The model, therefore, had spending, investment, and the need to invest in people to stimulate economic growth. To evolve the model into a post neo-classical form and achieve the endogenous element for growth a whole new set of institutions and language was developed to add credibility to the model. There was “Investors in People”, the “European Excellence Model” called the Excrement Model by one of our wags. There was an emphasis on “value added” as though adding wage costs to a product’s sale price was the same as adding real value. The fact that government could tax more wages as “value added” created more wage earners processing various parts of the production or retail process, was a misunderstanding about what economic “value” really is. Economic value is not the same as price.\nThe model was fatally flawed. It only looked as though it was capable of delivering long-term endogenous growth without the need for continual government investment or as it is better understood; spending, but it could not do this. The model was complex, supported by diversity, training, and education (including student debt) and therefore had debt as the only basis for the growth and borrowing to maintain consumption as a substitute for proper economic investment.\nUltimately the growth required was on the whole debt based and remains implacably so today. Private debt supporting consumption is also a feature of the post neo-classical model. It doesn’t matter who’s debt it is, it will create the appearance of growth through confidence and by maintaining aggregate demand, at least in the short term.\nAs we have said in many previous posts, endogenous debt all too easily becomes wealth for those who are either able to game the market with cheaply manufactured but expensively sold products or who are paid by the state. We call this process debtamorphosis. It is an unintended consequence of the post-neoclassical model.\nWhilst irresponsible debt and unjustified wealth are two consequence of the model there are we believe other consequences more appalling and these may not be easily identified as being linked to the failure of the west’s post neo-classical endogenous growth model. These appalling consequences include the myriad wars prosecuted or supported by the west in places like the middle east. When endogenous growth models fail to deliver proper growth then the value necessary for growth has to be unlocked from places where there is value but it is locked into an unsophisticated, low skill and possibly tribal or working class communities. Mass immigration into the working class areas in the west unlocks economic value as does war in poorer countries.\nUnlocking “value” rather than Oil is probably what was behind the Bush and Blair wars. The industrial scale “human rights” business and a myriad of busineness opportunities to nation build were identified; in the west human rights deliver too many human wrongs and overseas the EU becomes calcified as the middle east far from being an opportunity for exogenous growth for the western economies with the help of ISIS the US and Russia, turns itself into the world’s biggest car less car park.\nSad but we believe true.\n19.09.16 The people who support Corbyn “feel” there is something wrong with Britain, but don’t know what it is. Corbyn seems to speak to the confused and ill informed but what is wrong with Britain and is Corbyn the answer?\nJeremy Corbyn has been around for decades playing the rebel by naively joining forces with any “anti-capitalist” who happened to be in Islington perhaps plotting hatred and destruction of Israel or promoting a mutilating blend of Islamism and misogyny. No worry though no one took Jeremy very seriously…..he isn’t very bright…no really he didn’t even complete his degree at North London Poly. Jeremy is a middle-class boy who has landed a middle-class job (being an MP) for a complex constituency where you had to be able to square numerous circles. Equality for gays and support for Islamists anyone. Only a wittering old fool could pull this off because no one really expected him to be able to square circles but as long as he was nice to people (except the hated Tories) he could muddle along happily enough.\nWhen the Labour Party was seeking a new leader, therefore, Jeremy was the Parliamentary party’s “lefty” of choice for the candidate slate; a bit simple, not too sophisticated, nice but dim and steeped in lefty eccentricities (beard, vest, sandals, making jam etc) and unlikely to win.\nHowever, the brooding of the masses which had built up since Tony Blair stole the heart of the Labour party had been recently vented with a right wing shift from right wing labour supporters to Ukip. The honest but naive Guardian reading middle and working class “lefty” meanwhile, as opposed to “old Labour” supporter, who went to Ukip, saw in Jeremy a representative who stood for “intellectual” left wing stuff. For example anti “capitalism”, and anti “greedy” bankers, equality, fairness, good jobs, anti-austerity, the NHS, immigration, the public sector, “caring”, arms around the world etc. Jeremy was a one-man repository for the angst of the 21st century “intellectual” lefty. Even though his ideas are whimsical and incoherent it doesn’t matter because he is nice and “can be trusted” etc. His ability to avoid any kind of scrutiny is not so much down to a mastery of politics as simply a long-held view of himself as ” everyone’s friend”. Whilst this is true it betrays a total lack of moral integrity and principle.\nSo can Jeremy or the Momentum heavies that use him to smooth their path to power sort out Britain. Well of course not. Britain is desperate to abandon the kind of post-war state-controlled moral and economic socialism that makes everyone but an erstwhile “Guardian” reader feel queasy and mentally and emotionally interfered with. But all the political parties seem to reflect this post-war paradigm to a greater or lesser extent and strangely Jeremy is seen as an antidote to it which he of course, isn’t. Far from it!\nThe problem for Britain is that in too many of its important institutions it is essentially feudal, based on rigid hierarchy, command and control, power and authority. Modern socialism with its sanctimonious tentacles in Parliament and the Courts (particularly the disgrace of the human rights “industry”), the Civil Service, Health Service, police and legal professions is not going to abandon this hierarchical post-war pseudo-feudalism anytime soon. Jobs, status and pay at our expense depend on it and Jeremy will simply empower it and expand it as the actual economy for what it is currently worth struggles to borrow to pay for it all.\nWith the free market economy badly in need or reform and too reliant on debt and the public sector funded by debt; Jeremy is part of the problem and not part of the cure. If he started to look at the legal profession its costs and activities, the judiciary and the stupid cost of British “justice” the financially unsustainable and humanly wasteful criminal justice system, and the way the public sector (including sainted NHS) strips value from the economy whilst promoting debt and immorality he may begin to speak the language of revolution. As it is he is just another embarrassing 20th century left wing wind bag the like of which we the blue collar working and entrepreneurial masses have been trying to politely ignore for years.\nUp the revolution….the Blue Revolution.\n20.09.16 Following on from the recent posts on economics and society; how can we tell things are out of kilter?\nWe have examined post neo-classical endogenous growth theory and how in the absence of a closed economy mass inward migration and perhaps even war is utilised as a way of freeing up stored value locked into houses and communities within Western economies and beyond their various shores. This combined with debt fuels the “western economic model”. It is an economic paradigm which has like all previous paradigms got failure built into its DNA. As Karl Marx said, all paradigms or “epochs” sow the seeds of their own destruction. But it takes an extra era to cleanse society of the last threads of the periods that came before them. In simple terms to rid society of Feudalism in its many lingering manifestations, particularly in politics and law, it will take a paradigm that goes beyond capitalism or socialism. Socialism is a model of society which cannot rid itself of power-based hierarchy, authority and inequality because socialism requires these to order society in its theoretical image. The power of courts to pretend they deliver “human rights” rather than relying on humans respecting rights without the cost of the court is just one element of the “socialist” elitist process. And of course, socialism relies on the power of the state to deliver its other key ambitions, “equality”, “diversity” and “opportunity” the reality of which achieves all too often a shift from one sort of inequality to another; greater sexual equality replaced by a widening of economic and geographical inequality.\nIn the case of the current “socialist” or “mixed economic” paradigm the concepts born in the firmament of early capitalism; Contract, Choice and Consent are the seeds that threaten the socialist model’s long-term survival. The problem for the blue collar workers poised as they should be to take control of the levers of state power via the ballot box is that there are amassed forces of obstruction building up. These massed forces are without exception the “Barrons” of the public sector, and particularly the lawyer politician and the court. They don’t want a society and polity based on contract choice and consent as it would undermine the power of the state and its institutions to “govern” the masses in the way the masses “need” to be governed. And of course this at the financial expense of the masses themselves. In the absence of income from new economic value, the masses bankroll the socialist society with their personal debt and they are similarly burdened with paying taxes to pay government debt and government wages. Who really consents to do that? Yet it is the socialist who wants to ignore the will of the people over British Brexit and to burden the poor with more debt as the stuff shirted lawyers, civil servants and politicians grow fat on the debt of blue collar workers. This is the contradiction that Marx, had he been here, would have recognised. But you have us in the absence of Marx.\nWith relationships based on the decent values of capitalism namely contract, choice and consent (as distinct from the reality of early capitalism still with the corrupting blood of the feudal system pumping through its early elitist veins) the public can begin to develop new political institutions (similar to the Brexit vote). This process based on a moral free market economy will realign power to ensure that in the future the decent instincts of the public, uncorrupted by social alienation and the power of the state, and with a meaningful contract with those that govern them, will lead to a growing sense of social harmony. This isn’t utopianism as it has economic materialism at its core. We will explore this idea further, because how do you govern without the governing gaining a sense of power over the governed . If you understand the nature of a Blue Revolution, economic determinism and the power of Contract Choice and Consent the problem is less insoluble than it at first appears.\n22.09.16 Some billionaires become schemeingly political to preserve their wealth whilst others give the wealth away. Guess which is the Blue Revolutionary?\nThere is something sickening about Donald trump; and please don’t think it is because he is a populist, we have no concerns about such people in a healthy democracy, indeed they add colour and texture to a process which for too many people is “long in the tooth” and boring, namely democracy. Like Brexit in the UK, it takes something scary and heterodox to excite people and as the UK has found the consequences are benign in the short to medium term and like a journey, if you set off in the right direction in in the short to medium term the long term the risks of deviating slightly on the journey are at worst minimal.\nSo what of Trump? Well, Trump is a Billionaire and as such preens and promotes himself as though his ideas have a value and magnificence they would not have if the mythical “Joe the plumber” was coming out with them. It is a combination of his vacuous ideas and his wealth that makes us a little queasy. We feel the same way when a “Sleb” or rock star starts to promote ideas which are clearly daft if you happen to be receiving them in the land of the ordinary person. Sting, Russell Brand, and a bevvy of entitled wealthy people who want to diminish the lives of ordinary people often by persuading them that it is in their best interests to be exploited by commercial interests, or “marketing” as it is better known. This is a bit Like ISIS offering “dust bowl “Islamism to stressed communities in North Africa; stoning adulterers seems like a way of establishing authority…until it is your sister or daughter who is off to have her face and head pummelled to an unrecognisable jelly by a bunch of teenage boys lead by a perverted and psychotic older man. Ok that analogy is a bit over the top!\nSo the concept of ideas being given greater validity by virtue of who is saying them is something we at a Blue Revolution feel needs to be urgently challenged. Trump falls squarely into this category.\nHowever, there is another objection. The “Billionaire Class”, and they are a class unique among the established classes have their wealth as a result of an all too complex social and economic matrix. The Koch brothers in the |US and we guess “Sir” Phillip Green in the Uk probably wish there was a war on the poor and welfare the dependent. If you like a massive reduction is taxation to allow them to hold on to more of their wealth. What they fail to grasp and the billionaires like Mr and Mrs Mark Zuckerberg and Mr and Mrs Bill Gates grasp is that their wealth is a payment from others to them and only by dint of the free market being “gamed”by governments and vested interests are they billionaires at all. A market that was not mediated or engineered by power and vested interests would not allow the creation of people with such vast wealth and the wealthy have an obligation to recognise that simple fact.\nPeople would not choose to make Phillip Green a billionaire, it happens because the free market has made it possible. We don’t agree with destroying the free market it reflects even in an unregulated form Contract, Choice and Consent and these precious gems need preserving at all cost. We are not naive Red Revolutionaries. Mark Zuckerberg seems to understand all this too and has the modesty to recognise that the wealth he has belongs as much to those who have granted it to him as it does to himself. Hence his desire to give it back not through posturing and preening in a narcissistic demonstration of self-love (or loathing?) but through good deeds. That is a Blue Revolutionary mind at work at the top of the income scale as we toil away in living rooms, studio flats and workshops at the other end.\n23.09.16 As all revolutionaries know, revolution should be evolutionary. So who are the enemy of the Blue Revolution?\nAs any school person knows the march of social progress is, or should be, based on a society moving beyond the constraints of the existing social system and evolving some new structures whilst slowly teasing themselves away from what properly belongs in the past. In modern Britain, for example, we have a major problem. We have the feudal “legal system”; bewigged narcissists, too many of whom remain”public school” have insulated themselves and protected their elevated social status from any form of social movement which is likely to undermine their elevated social, economic and political position. A sort of “Crown Immunity”. They are the enemies of the “blue Revolution”. More a threat than the Corbyn 1970’s Socialists.\nWe try not to name names in a Blue Revolution blog (even though some of us do!) but you only have to look at the legal “brains” behind the “Third way”; the Islington Blairite neo socialists to see they were all Blair and Mrs. Blair’s frequent dinner guests. Newly amongst their number Amal Clooney who whilst doing good works standing up for real victims also dabbles in the post neoclassical nonsence of “human rights”.\nBlair’s posh chums shamefully remain loyal to their “useful idiot”, even to the point of getting him off the hook of war crimes allegations, whilst the same bewigged monsters pursue the honest “Tommy Atkins”; thrown into Blairs “post-neoclassical endogenous….blah ..blah” …PFI war of western reconstruction. Yet being poor, stressed and shot at the ordinary soldier unlike Blair is accused of being guilty of lucrative “human rights” abuses and other “crimes”, according to the Blairite army of lawyers anyway. These parasitic people also make money from the lower ranking “public sector” worker, customs officers, prison and police officers, probation officers, social workers. Why do they do it; because it is their system and they can!!\nIf they wear a wig, hang around British courts and describe themselves as “human rights” lawyers……..they are the parasitic enemy of the Blue Revolution. The enemy of the people. We don’t shoot them or smash up their power bases…we use democracy to stop their activities; we simply stop paying them legal aid……or we will! Are we angry? Yes.\nWe can’t progress beyond “state socialism” however “progressive” the whimpering lefty liberal tells us it is, without clipping the wings of the politico-legal establishment. Reform of the legal system, the army of Judges, barrister, QC’s, solicitors, paralegals, legal executives many paid to needle and antagonise ordinary people in pursuit of their own personal profit and self-aggrandizement and all in the name of the state whom they often serve as politicians too. What the “progressives” don’t get is that “progress” means the end of the “state” as we understand it now. It must become little more than a light touch regulator up holding through a simplified legal and political system the Contract, Choice, and Consent which underpins all civilised societies, with power being devolved to the people.\n25.09.16 If we consider Blair and his legacy why didn’t the “third way” become the “Blue Revolution” thirty years ago?\nSome of us are old enough to remember the landslide New Labour victory of 1997. As Blue Revolutionaries we consider whether the Blair “third way” was a nascent “Blue Revolution” blown off course by global circumstances or whether it was a nieve effort to combine the Public, Private and Charitable sectors in an attempt to re-define a collapsing “capitalist ” system as it morphed into a “consumer based” free market system.\nIt is an article of our faith that the Capitalism drove so much positive change around the globe. It started the process of greater equality for race, gender and culture. It provided the financial pump priming for the health service and a wave of nationalised industries. All brought into existence by a British post-war socialist government. At the same time, the now derided “grammars” were propelling working class boys and girls into the “establishment”. Unfortunately, this working class success resulted in the manipulation of the well-intentioned working class “entryists” into the establishment by the self-interested “old establishment” threatened by real working class success. This brings to an end Grammars thus denying two generations of working class children the opportunity to shape the world for their parents and siblings. They were forced to give way to Blair, Cameron and Clegg. Public school to a man.\nWhilst the British Tory Party popularised the “evil eyes” of Blair in 1997 it was really out of a sense that he was going to slide back to socialism nothing to do with his third way or the perverted version we ended up with. It was never likely that Blair would flip flop back to socialism. Blair was a free marketeer and was comfortable with people being stinking rich. The legacy of Blair is the destruction of Iraq and the Jeremy Corbyn phenomenon. Socialist, Blair certainly was not.\nSo to the point. A Blue Revolution respects the rights of the individual and supports the rights of everyone based very simply on Contract, Choice and Consent. Blair, by contrast, grinned his way into our lives offering “diversity”, a load of sociological woo which set the differences between people ahead of the similarities. “Diversity thus ignored the cultural brutality of denying people and particularly women choice and consent. These simple fundamentals were denied many many migrants. This was because the Blair elite as white liberals turned away from any kind of moral or ideological conflict with cultures that owed their principles to an age when social and economic contributions were gender or caste based. The human rights “industry” upholds rights for too many people, usually men, who don’t believe in rights, particularly gay, women’s or children’s rights. Great work guys; and we pay for this.\nSo the meta-principle of the third way was morally ambiguous. It was secular western but without a moral core defining rights within a moral framework. We could “free trade” and as long as it was legal it was moral. The minorities, of course, reverted back to their own cultural certainties horrified by Blair’s moral ambiguities. He is morally ambiguous as a person too!\nSo this moral ambiguity led to free trade within the economy becoming perverted by personal interest and greed. Like Blair the third promoted the powerful. The government sector was able to manipulate state spending to ensure that the project rewarded those who were seen as the champions of the third way, the business which made profit as jobs were exported to China, Government employees seen as the theocracy of the third way and of course the legal political elite for whom the laws of Human Rights and the EU became a playground for making huge amounts of tax payers money. This is pretty much the governmental and legal context of the “third way”. The social context was Gordon Brown’s welfare reforms which like the “free market” was a consumer facing welfare model. Welfare like the government and legal contexts above was all about maintaining aggregate demand to fulfil the objectives of the post-neoclassical endogenous growth model. This model as we have said before can’t work as spending does not “multiply” investment it simply multiplies consumption with profit and investment being off-shored due to globalisation.\nSo before closing this rather tedious analysis can we explain the differences between the Blue Revolution and the third way. Well yes. A Blue Revolution is not morally ambiguous. It has at its core an absolute commitment to Contract, Choice and Consent. Whilst people or cultures may choose to overlook these principles a government imbued with a Blue Revolution upholds them and only “trades” with other countries who observe them. There can be no freedom if you have no right to consent. Having said that the myth that welfare creates real choice is another piece of nonsense. British working class girls conflicted with too many choices which are “gamed” by welfare are some of the unhappiest in the world. They are expected to work but also encouraged to have babies by the welfare system. These are often babies they don’t want with “men” they don’t want. It isn’t just working class boys who are “failed” by the system. This time, though it’s the welfare as opposed to the education system. Both modern creations of the “third way”.\nThe Blue Revolution does not buy into the idea that “consumption” is a good in itself if it simply provides debt based wealth to government employees (via taxation) and “businessmen” who manufacture tat and sell at a ramped up prices to “consumers”. The market-based economy is built on a false belief that growth can be engineered by debt. This myth benefits the wealthy the lawyers and the politicians. It pays for and promotes a global elite and underpins the “hegemony” that is upheld via the Courts the “human rights industry” and the EU. To start to change this “hegemony” we had to leave the EU. European blue collar workers will thank the British for their radicalism.\nFinally, we don’t believe that people are born equal or can ever achieve equality. However, the elite has created a system which promotes their interests and allows the creation of Phillip Green’s and others. This is reflected in schooling which allows a private sector to flourish and provide jobs in the elite occupations whilst the rest are given a “standard” education in the public sector. To maintain this in the existing system, the selection where it exists is by puzzles and not by encouraging practical skills like spelling and maths. We believe in grammars but also want to get away from selection by puzzle and select by a child’s ability to spell and do maths. This will scare the “elite” as anyone can learn to spell and do times tables and fractions. Coaching to complete puzzles, the gaming of the system to benefit the elite, will end.\nThe third way abolished grammars, abolished morality, promoted debt and debt based wealth, created an elite of lawyers and politicians who ran Britain and Europe in their own image. This model, as Marx suggested, needs to be negated. Is the champion of the Blue collar worker Mrs May up to the job?\n01.10.16 Corbyn’s 21st Century Socialism has only one small problem; there is no role for “socialism” in a place where there is no social or economic value, namely the 21st Century. . But why?\nJeremy Corbyn a kindly old fool who shifts between the startled and absent look of someone out of his depth to the aggressive sloganising student in total control of his loquaciousness, even though to most sane people he is talking absolute rubbish. Well intentioned in a Gordon Brown sort of way but rubbish none the less.\nBut how can we be so sure that socialism has no place in the 21st century? Well, it is very simple really and it comes down to social and economic value. In the heyday of socialism, Britain and the area called the EU were capable of producing both social and economic value. By modern standards, social value is terribly unfashionable; mums at home and dads out at work, low levels of divorce and a genuine love of family and concern for neighbours. It is possible to imagine a 21st-century version of the above but entitlement and welfare sort of pervert the aspiration. High levels of social value reduce the cost of government. This ensures that when economic value is created it isn’t wasted on a public sector coping with a misfiring society due to social unrest, poor public health, high crime, broken families, loneliness……and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, Corbyn and the collection of vulnerable, damaged, misguided and downright dangerous people who currently form the Labour Party’s membership are precisely the people who represent the people from these backgrounds. People for whom a socialist government is a solution to their social unrest or unhappiness as it will resource them and more importantly employ them. Who amongst the socialists, therefore, really wants to see a return to social value.\nThe situation with economic value is even more perverse as we don’t produce any real economic value at all. The “rich” are politicians, lawyers and those who rather than taking tax revenue to make themselves rich, simply rip off the government or rip off the debt-burdened consumer. Socialism in “classical” terms takes surplus value off capitalists and spend it on the people. Today the “capitalist” doesn’t really exist, the business man or woman is dependent upon the debt of others or the debt of the government. We call this debtamorphosis. But when everything is based on debt there is no value for Corbyn and his army of “friends” to acquire. It’s just more debt for the rest of us Jez. Hardly the solution to the problems of the 21st century unless of course, you are stupid or selfish enough to shift the responsibility to those so far unborn who will live in the 22nd century. However, by that time the under-class will be in control and there will be no Contract, Choice and Consent just control coercion and compulsion. If the futures red the future is …….well decide for yourselves, but we believe the Blue Revolution is the only way to save our values, our society, our economy, and our planet!!\n05.10.16 Is Theresa May a Blue Revolutionary? Possibly a bit in some ways but Dave and Co certainly were not. What’s the difference?\nApart from the obvious and disastrous re-engineering of the British financial and housing economics in the style of Blair and Co; a lazy (and ultimately it would have been a doomed) attempt to create growth through the private sector and personal borrowing. All this primed on the basis of Government borrowing engendering the economic confidence necessary for everyone to borrow and keep borrowing. We hope TM understands this is a dangerous model but one that the EU and the west in general is, like a drug addict on heroin, unwilling to abandon. TM also seems to have established some blue collar credentials and seems destined in time to needle the old Blairite establishment of lawyers, and senior public sector boxwallahs. All of the course handsomely remunerated at the public’s expense; or rather at the expense of the public’s debt.\nWhere Blair and Dave and Co however really demonstrate they are part of the dying elite as opposed to the emerging elite of mass political influence or a Blue Revolution as we like to describe it, is in respect of “justice” and in particular that portion of the notion of “justice” which involves the foot soldiers of the declining elite; lawyers. Lawyers like process. They like the process more than outcomes. It doesn’t really matter to a lawyer, and the more senior, the less bothered they are, what happens at the end of a case. Something will happen and lawyers will claim a hefty fee.\nNow Dave sponsored the Saudi Arabian’s as members of some UN human rights quango. It’s the sort of daft stuff Blair at his most deluded would have been capable of doing.We do understand that you have to do work with grubby regimes out of mutual self-interest, but sponsoring them and almost conferring a “human rights” compliant status on them…..well how does that work? It works however because the Saudi’s have “cleaned up their act” and have developed a “human rights compliant process” which would make the lawyers at Doughty Street or Matrix proud. What the Saudi’s do is stone and behead for “crimes” such as “Harlotry” or Adultery, or murder and having put the defendant through a “human rights compliant process” behead them in public.\nNow this process model is seeing all sorts of ordinary people processed in Britain. Of course, British people would not expect to suffer a humiliating death but the modern legal system is all about the process, not the outcome so dangling on the end of a rope is not incompatible with a “humane process” and it’s us the blue collared workers and the unprivileged who may one day find an army of public school educated lawyers more than happy to process us humanely to the gallows. More likely of course if witless Corbyn’s lynch mob take control.\nOur legal friends have created a publicly funded monster that consumes our debt but all too often leaves us, as it did four hundred years ago;speechless.\n07.10.16 Corbyn has more in common with his rebels than he thinks. Is Keir Starmer the “Higgs boson” at the heart of 21st Century “socialism”?\nWe are no friends of reactionary movements; those that out of either stupidity or self-interest hold back progress. Unfortunately, by witlessly promoting the interests of the well healed public sector “supremos”, lawyers and sundry hangers-on, the Labour Party is not as progressive as it would like us to believe it is. In fact, it is not “progressive” at all. It also has poor progressive credentials because of its economically and socially illiterate belief that “poor people” remain morally infantile due to lack of welfare from “Tories” or lack of correct political conditioning. However this infantilism is not generally seen as due to either their diet of sanctimonious amoral welfarism or indeed their manipulation by big business all too keen to flog them rubbish in exchange for their welfare and debt based income. But if viewed by the left as infantile it justifies for both left and right wings an army of welfare experts and a legal system which can simultaneously punish, educate and “protect”. What can be more infantilizing than that! Carry on breeding!\nSo who better to unite the “Blair” left and their handwringing “third way” mumbo jumbo with the lynch mob of the hard left and visceral haters of the “Tories” than a Blair supremo and promoter of all things “public law” and “public sector”; the legal establishment hero and lover of bureaucracy Keir Starmer. This man believes that bureaucracy is alway going to be in the hands of people like him, all politically correct and a necessary bulwark against the “Blue Revolutionary” mob (Brexiteers!). Both the “third-wayers” and the hard left have one or two things in common; a love of nieve diversity programmes, mass immigration and the socialism of the EU perhaps, but absolutely, without doubt, the belief that they must be part of a publicly funded “vanguard” of politically and legislatively intelligent people who like Plato’s philosopher kings are equipped and therefore entitled to rule over the workers. The problem is that the workers have little time for either camp and are becoming increasingly frustrated by both listening to them and more importantly paying for them. Hence Keir’s timely bit of entryism; to protect the interests of the Islingtonian champagne socialists from the hated Tories and the class warriors of labour who might be morally confused by them. He is the left’s Higgs boson discovered in the particle collider of the fractious and chaotic labour movement.\n09.10.16 An anatomy of the West’s anomie; can we live without our “false gods”? V2\nWe will spare any experts a definition of Anomie and will leave the general reader to get out a decent dictionary of psychology for a definition and move onto a look at what the causes of anomie are in the modern western world. We see the world heading in the wrong direction as a result of governments ignoring their responsibility for promoting the social problems that bedevil their populations. At the same time, they watch the decline of civilisation in some parts of this world as for example in North Africa. In other parts of the world regimes consolidate their particular definition of “civilisation” by encouraging a return to a bigoted form of orthodoxy such as we are seeing in parts of “Christian” Africa, the parts of the Middle East which are not war zones and of course the exemplar of religious populism Putin’s Russia.\nWhat these places are doing, which they can do, due to the existence of a latent or not so latent faith-based morality is re-booting it to protect their communities from imploding in the face of global stressors such as poverty, collapsing oil prices, and the encroaching corruption of what we at a Blue Revolution call secular westernism. The western response has been to basically offer as an alternative to this faith-based reaction an offer of cheap debt, bureaucracy and post neo-classical blah blah blah. The “debt” model has the benefit of having an immediate attractiveness, more money, more intervention, and until 2007/8 a seemingly permanent stability. However, let us consider the practical and emotional consequences of each model; to be mischievous we can call them the faith and debt models.\nIn the faith model, people return to bogeyman prejudice against Gays, Jews and anyone else who isn’t culturally incorporated. However, just as in pockets of the US where this is going on at Trump rallies for example (Tumpism is a perverted form of Christianity), people feel good and able to blame someone else for their or their countries woes but there is nothing progressive in store for them. They are being conned of course. Just as Hitler’s working class held out for a Volkswagen if they flogged themselves to death in the run up to World War two, so these duped people around the planet are going to get little if anything from Trump, Putin, or the adoption of brutal Islamic theology. They may, however, be happier than their blue collar equivalents elsewhere (if there is a blue collar equivalent!) and in particular their equivalents in Britain and the EU.\nAmongst certain groups, anomie is prevalent on the continent more so than in the UK. We have examined it comprehensively in the past but it is fair to say that the policy of ghettoising and culturally isolating a migrant population creates a sub-culture who experience a unique anomie they react to it by trying to “purify” the host culture probably out of anger and frustration. By contrast, the British first, second and third and fourth generation migrants are the least likely to suffer anomie; at least by the standards of the indigenous population or indeed populations in the EU, because in the UK they have “in work welfare” supporting them in low waged work (taxi driving, food preparation, warehouse and shop work) but more significantly they have political and social acceptance underpinning their stable family units shored up by a simple, usually Islamic faith. In this respect, they are a valuable asset to Britain which our continental cousins simply cannot culturally or sociologically replicate. As for the white Europeans the indigenous population simply have to look on, neutered by politicians who just like the British left operate with a superior moral framework which views ordinary people’s concerns as small-minded, parochial and bigoted; in other words worth simply ignoring.\nSo what of the white British indigenous population and their anomie? Well white Britain and the US working class like much of the working class in the EU have a particular problem with Anomie. It is evidenced by a disillusionment with mainstream politicians. Working class people are sick of the monochrome lives they have been forced to lead by a political elite who are remote from them and who have no interests in their lives or the economics and social realities which shapes their lives, most notably their debt and insecurity. This causes social decay and crime which the elite “manage” with an army of state operatives.\nBut what is the economic reality which must for us, (we are economic determinists after all) underpin this anomie? Well, firstly the “old socialist” system was based on post-war Government intervening to promote the interests of the blue collar worker. In the Uk, a range of post-war policy making (except abolishing grammar schools) was seen within this social and economic context as “progressive”. Welfare and nationalisations, the NHS and extending educational provision were all good things done by government and paid for by the surplus value misappropriated by capitalists who without the intercession of the government would have kept the wealth for themselves. The death duties levied on the rich after the war helped pay for these progressive policies.\nHowever, this golden era of post-war political consensus has given way to a metastasizing culture of welfare promoting procreation and idleness, human rights devoid of relevance, and an abandonment of personal responsibility as post-war governments sucked up via well-intentioned policies, much of the social morality which both defined and restricted people’s social expectations. It has left the mass of people feeling abandoned by “society” and for too many people the only body that can be blamed for this anomie is the government. This is because for too many people the government is what embodies society, social problems are the responsibility of the government as the concept of society has become largely meaningless. The rich lawyer pursues the squaddie whilst the elderly lose their council services. This is the inherent contradiction of “socialism”; it unavoidably diminishes society and replaces society with government intervention. As the blue collar workers and their offspring stare anomie in the eye, the whole panoply of the state emerges triumphant along with its army of highly paid “leaders”, lawyers and hangers-on.\nHowever, this is not the whole story. British politicians have only just realised anomie exists. This is because politicians have an innate tendency to engage in confirmation bias (to see what they want to see i.e. how respected their views are), and because of the unexpected rise in the Uk of Nigel Farage and Ukip in the last four years, plus the slow relentless decline of the civil engineers of anomie; New Labour. Corbyn is an emotional reaction to anomie but he isn’t part of the solution he remains part of the problem. He is a man of the state! If you don’t believe us listen to him.\nSo what is an economic determinists explanation of all this? What makes our critique “coherent” whilst modern politicians offer a diet of muddle, misunderstanding, utopianism, or all three? Well, this is going to sound like a repeat of stuff we have already said previously. However, we will say it again. The state takes money from the workers and encourages their indebtedness whilst it simultaneously undermines society by promoting unsustainable lives of worthless ignorance. It does this by removing too many real moral choices, choices that make people feel alive as moral agents. As a result of our anomie, we have made ourselves happy with an array of false gods such as consumption, celebrity, sex, money and self-promotion. All this gives rise to pregnant unhappy girls, boys drifting into promiscuity and crime, women being victimised by predatory men whilst men shorn of responsible fatherhood drift into drinking and suicide. The government has been forced to take responsibility for this moral crisis but its solution is to extend the reach of the state further, creating either universal “rights” to lifestyles which the state has decided the taxpaying workers have to pay for (single teenage parenthood, unemployment through obesity), or new “crimes” to control deteriorating moral behaviour (coercion or stalking). The workers have to pay for the army of state workers and lawyers who maintain this alienating hegemony we have no choice. We would describe this as the publicsectocracy using debtamorphosis to maintain the alienating power of the state which itself maintains and promotes the people’s anomie. Our analysis is grounded in sound economics and is not “utopian” because western culture is first and foremost economically bankrupt and this precedes its moral bankruptcy.\nFor us the critical questions are these; do the public know what they are feeling is anomie and what is their appetite to abandon their false gods of consumption, sex and self-interest? Moreover what is the government’s appetite to reign in its army of publicsectorcrats and re-build real social morals even if it slows or even chokes off increasing consumer demand and the expansion of the power of the state.\n11.10.16 Having consolidated, the “remainers” and our friend Sir Keir are clearly intent on derailing “Brexit”\nWe have argued before that the “real” establishment are the lawyers. Lawyers in politics wield more power and have access to structures, a vocabulary and vested interests which can only promote the state funding of law and the extension of the state. This is to ensure the state’s moral and legal hegemony and protect it from the interests of the mob. Unfortunately when it is time for society to move on this reactionary group act as self-interested counter-revolutionaries. Whether it is Clinton in the US or the Blairs and their entourage of supporters in the Barristers Chambers of Islington, the progress of Britain, the EU and the world generally is not going to be promoted one jot by these men and women who like the Sheriffs and overlords of the fifteenth century owe their living to the patronage of the state.\nLawyers more than businessmen and women represent the interests of the past. They always have done, but whereas “the capitalist” model could be accommodated by our bewigged lawyers and judiciary; because the capitalists became increasing wealthy and therefore able to pay for law which reflected their interests, the legal class now must fight or rather manipulate the government and legislature in parliament to preserve their particular brand of professional self-interest. Lucky for them there are lots of lawyers in Parliament. The reason is quite clear to us; the state sector with its army of committee members, employees, processes, policies and hangers-on have replaced the capitalist “business” hegemony with a governmental one. It is a command and control structure albeit fairly benign thus hard to overthrow in revolutionary terms, ideal, therefore for lawyers who like process. This hegemonic structure is not just British it is replicated across the west and just like during the trauma of past revolutions the power brokers within this hegemony whilst claiming “progressive” values are essentially conservative in character. Just like an alcoholic who “can’t see a problem with another one” our legal establishment can’t see the inherent injustice in their own socialist state model. It is coherent and self-contained within its own terms of reference, however, it shamefully reflects the interests of this public sector governing class and not the interests of the people who’re paying wages, debt, and limited life chances pay for it.\nSo with Britains Blue Collar revolution catching these “elite” people out by demanding a change in the way Britain is governed and an uncoupling from the lactating sow of the EU, they have been forced to consolidate. We can see now that these reactionaries self-promoting and counter-revolutionary values fly in the face of the democratic instincts and decent values of the British people. Sir Keir Starmer is probably at the vanguard of the forces of the status quo brought in by the witless Corbyn to take on the “hated Tories”. We see with Clegg, Milliband and others the anti-democratic instincts of the British socialist establishment taking human form. All will claim moral superiority and a patronising disregard for the will of the people and all are like the battling Cavaliers fighting against the natural flow of history; the Blue Revolution. If only our media and other opinion formers could see these people the way we do. If they did, perhaps they would start to see the current economic ups and downs as the birth pains of a new genuinely progressive global economic and social landscape and then they might stop catastrophising this important process of change.\nPredicting the near future we anticipate that Project fear will re-emerge and “project unconstitutional government” will be developed probably by Starmer. But ultimately the world of the elite politician undermining the lives of the workers with a diet of immorality funded by debt and promoted and protected by law will we hope start to end once we leave the EU. Oh and we think Her Majesty the Queen is probably with us on all of this!\n12.10.16 Capitalism in crisis? Capitalism no longer exists but the “free market” certainly isn’t totally free or an open market!\nWe get bored trying to explain why we no longer have “capitalism”but still the media pundits and of course the “left” insist on using a term which had probably lost all its relevance by 1950. In the UK the programme of nationalisations and the bankruptcy of heavy industry after the war rendered any notion of “capitalists” stalking the economy exploiting workers by paying them a pittance and then “stealing” the value they created with the sweat of their brow and the toil of their hands frankly ridiculous. However the left need to persuade their misguided sad and deluded followers that such monsters still exist. Socialism is you see essentially parasitic on “Capitalism” and so Corbyn needs to promote its existence. Without “capitalism” there is no socialism. And that, as they say, is the left wings problem. Of course, the Blairites and the legal and intellectual socialists know the class war is over but they can’t accept the end of the post-war socialist experiment. This is because their wages and status as members of the publicsectocracy rely on a docile “working class” over whom they administer a debt based state funded welfare benevolence. Don’t they all look smug when they talk about how benign they are?\nThe problem for the “left” and “right” wings of the Labour party in the UK or the Democrats in the US, however, is that the traditional relationships within the economy which funded government spending in the past is no longer able to fund government spending today. So as we have argued previously the economy has become debt based with “confidence” being the currency that loosens up borrowing and spending to maintain aggregate demand. The Bank of England and the last UK government were both obsessed with “consumer confidence” that is because the current economic model is based on it.\nThe immorality in this model and where the right wing socialist is probably more knowingly immoral than their thick left-wing counterpart is that they are intent on preserving a system that pays them well out of working class people’s debt and taxes. This model undermines society in general. It does this by preventing a cheap public collective morality re-establishing itself; people leave too many things to the state. It also promotes the power of the state; a system of laws, rules and regulations which are less and less able to deliver care, support, responsibility and common sense, but which encourages debt, divorce, illegitimate children, promiscuity, declining mental and emotional health, crime and social alienation.\nThe rules of the state’s model prevent any collective action or in reality “choice”as when the state comes in the front door, contract, choice and consent leave by the back window. The reasons are complex but essentially the public sector model like the old capitalist one is always struggling to preserve itself in the face of demands to change (progressive change!). This translates into the obstruction of social progress. The “socialists” brought the “capitalists” to heel but who brings the “socialist public sector model” to heel now? This is highly relevant when the state is so large, so indebted and with social obligations and pensions outstripping the ability to fund them. Mrs May possibly? Corbyn, or Milliband or the Lib Dems; no chance. These left wing parties are essentially counter- revolutionary. They wish to preserve the awesome power of the state even in the face of the impossibility of this being achieved without collective pain on a national scale.\nSo with no real capitalism, people’s debt being won and lost by governments or free marketeers as though it is winnings in a casino game; what is to become of a western society that is slowly being alienated to the point of bloody revolution? Unless of course the media elite, academics, lawyers and politicians of the centre wake-up and smell the Blue Revolutionary coffee, things don’t look very good to us.\nHowever, the situation could be improved with little upheaval. Intergenerational affection needs to be valued again; people who have “value” such as their own home should share it with the young. The State is failing to deliver on too many fronts. Having taken on “social care” it offers costly indifference. People should have to “choose” to have children not simply be subsidised to have them by a state that doesn’t understand that the real “cost” of children is emotional not financial. The public is prevented from realising they are the biggest threat to the NHS by politicians who dishonestly trade insults which ignore the appalling health of the nation.\nIn addition to the “social value” described above the whole modern economy of renting, platforming, zero hours contracts needs to be tackled and tackled hard; not colluded with so as to exclude people from operating fairly in these “free markets”. The law is being used to exclude small operators from the free market, increase inequality and increase the interests of “big market players”. We are only just starting to research the modern economic marketplace, but if we had more social value underpinning people’s lives (and less government) the modern free market may not be that scary and it is flexible enough to ensure everyone can find a place within it.\n16.10.16 Contract, Choice and Consent the jewels of the western world: how safe are they with Corbyn’s Socialism? V2\nThe west has progressed through many social and economic phases and has now gone beyond capitalism a phase which created revolutionary ideas such as workers right to Contract, Choose and Consent. However, post-capitalism is now at a point where it has experienced the elevation and consolidation of the power of the State. Whether in the US or the UK some politicians represent the progress of this now timed out model; these politicians and hangers on are the “Publicsectocracy” . The original intention of the state’s involvement in the economy was quite rightly to “tame” the self-interested capitalists; who were indifferent to the suffering of the “free to contract” workers for whom in reality there was little freedom.\nWhere a country was in the grip of an early social and economic model (tribalism, feudalism) the process of colonisation created initially in theory, but then moving into practice the widespread rights associated with capitalism; Contract, Choice and Consent. Capitalism was needed to enable these countries to trade. Capitalism increased the productive capacity of the colonised countries too, reducing starvation and uncertainty. Uncertainty and starvation are the characteristics of earlier social and economic models.\nThis legacy, the legacy of capitalism, meant that by the 20th-century women had rights previously denied them, discrimination went from being not merely distasteful but wholly unacceptable. Eventually, homosexuality became legal as countries started to recognise the implications of capitalism’s legacy; namely that people were factors of production free to contract, having rights that were based on Contract Choice and Consent to maximise productive capacity. These economic rights transcend social prejudice. It is the legacy of early social reformers and much later, western socialism that these capitalist economic and social rights were made widely available to ordinary workers.\nSo what of the modern left wing and particularly Corbyism and what if anything relevant is going on in the US? Well having said that the driving home of capitalism’s “troika” of rights was the legacy of social reformers and mid 20th-century socialists, should we be celebrating the rise of Corbyn, Momentum and his army of avid and loyal supporters? Sadly we at a Blue Revolution think not. Corbyn is first and foremost a man of the state. Like many of his avid followers he has a superficial grasp of economics and in particular Marxist economics and therefore believes that the state can promote progress. In this, he is no different from the Lib Dem’s and Tim Farron, and Blairites such as Keir Starmer. However, whereas these “progressive” politicians are simply misguided because they naively believe in the power of the state to do good, Corbyn sees the state as in instrument of settling on the UK domestic front a now non-existent class war and globally he supports the pre-eminence of any ant-western ideology. These anti-western ideologies remain unreformed by capitalism’s legacy of Contract, Choice and Consent so are at their core cruel, discriminatory (against gays and women, people of the wrong tribe or faith). Unfortunately, these anti-western ideologies are mainly tribal and totalitarian (in Marxian terms totalitarian is basically feudal) so the prejudices which they promote thanks to capitalism’s legacy, the west has become “grown up about”.\nNow, this capitalism we refer to no longer exists; it did its best work three or more hundred years ago. Social reformers refined its more brutal bi-products and we now enjoy its legacy. However, the change needed to reform capitalism, required the intervention of the state. The state and its army of politicians, lawyers and hangers-on; the publicsectocracy, have, like the Clintons in the US and the Blairites and Cameroons in the UK failed to recognise that the job is largely done and it is they now who use the state to serve their own interests. They should return more power to the people, reassured that Contract, Choice and Consent are now embedded in British and western culture and are only compromised by immigration from cultures which do not share or even understand these basic cultural values.\nHowever whilst the benign publicsectocracy, clings on to the ideology of the state as core to people’s lives thus making people pay for the privilege of having them in charge, in the case of Corbyn and his lynch mob there is no benign misunderstanding; the state is there to acquire power, hold power and pursue an ideology that provides a safe haven for beliefs that last saw the light of day in the west before the advent of capitalism. In other words, Corbyn, Seamus Milne and John McDonnell have more in common with Presidents Putin and Assad, various torturers and head choppers than they do with the vast majority of decent British democrats and workers, who whilst frustrated by what the public sector has become don’t want to return to a feudal system with the state and its apparatus in charge bullying them, taxing them and possibly killing them in the name of preserving Corbyn’s compromised and contaminated “internationalist” ideology.\n16.10.16 We have had a meeting and we want to know; what is the Corbynite “left” up to? Here are our ideas.\nIt is very easy to take the Corbyn left at face value. Native grassroots socialists and gullible journalists swallow the democratic and egalitarian agenda hook, line and sinker! However, some things have made our largely crusty bunch of proto-Marxians question the motives of the elite champagne socialists who are pretenders to the Conservatives as a government in waiting. What do the “left” really think about Blue Collar Britain and are we, the Blue Collar Britons, safe in their hands? We think not.\nWe have said in many earlier posts that socialism is the inevitable intervention of the state within the workings of the capitalist system. A system which liberated people from the enslavement of feudalism but which gave advantages to the capitalists who exploited the worker. Trades Unions and the Labour movement were necessary counterweights to the awesome power of the capitalist system. To its eternal credit the combination of liberal Christion faith and liberal economics drove levels productive capacity which before capitalism could never have been imagined. Feeding continents! Technological innovation, equality, democracy and freedom all followed in the wake of the capitalist revolution. The first Bue Revolution. The socialist negation of the raw capitalist system was, without a doubt, necessary. However, the socialist system was a transitional phase not a phase to be embedded and promoted to advantage a new class of the elite. The problem with Corbyn’s Labour party is that whilst he may be a well-intentioned witless lightweight, the people around him including Milne and Chakrabarti are well into the idea of using their elite position to personally advantage themselves with little regard to the people who pay for their pre-eminence; namely us, the workers! They take advantage of the education that is available to the elite because they are the elite. Socialism’s dirty secret is that it has spawned an elite even worse than the old money class-based elite. The new elite look down their nose at people who don’t have their values, but not those who don’t have their wealth or education. They like the underclass; it’s how they justify their caring credentials, caring as long as they get well paid to “care”. Oh and the proles fall into line when expected to do so.\nSo we see references to Brexiters being “thick” we hear “Tories” being reviled as the left camouflage their own advantage and attempts to consolidate it by picking on what they see as the money elite (bad) as opposed to their ideological AND money elite (good). Of course, all this social advantage is paid for by the taxpayer and borrower. It is this which makes “Lady” Chakrabarti, Milne and so many others on every spectrum of the left more immoral than even the worst Tory grandee.\nFinally a point about education. Chakrabarti sends her kid to a posh school. What this does is enable this kid to get access to other privileged young people, but more importantly it confers the language and confidence of inclusion into the elite; something Labour….Socialist Labour, wish to deny to those who pay them; again us! We get comprehensive and no Grammars so they consolidate via private education. Why would anyone support this bunch of frauds, what we need is a Blue Revolution, not a red one!\n17.10.16 The use of the divorce metaphor is apt for Brexit. The UK is the abused female spouse who wants to get out but who is going to get a “bit of fist” first..\nThe phrase a “bit of fist” refers to the old practice in the midlands counties of the UK of beating a wife who is believed to be disloyal, dishonouring or disobedient. It is the behaviour of the brute and in some communities still goes on even today. However, the Brexit debacle highlights the trend of remainers to give Britain a good hiding or at least threaten it, and in the case of the EU to actually to have the power to deliver the punishment.\nWe all find this deeply disturbing. There is no justification for locking anyone into a dysfunctional relationship. This “arranged marriage” was probably doomed to fail as the elites of the EU carved up a deal to make the project “work”. The UK got banking and finance, Germany got manufacturing industry and the French got agriculture. All preserved by a cosy arrangement that has ultimately denied Africa agricultural development and has locked all 28 countries into an unholy alliance or “customs area” as it is euphemistically called buying stuff the Germans make, paid for by British arranged finance and all fed or perhaps “watered” by the French. The world suffers because the EU has decided it wants to do well by trading with itself\nOf course, the eventual failure is guaranteed…ten…fifteen years from now this deeply flawed continental business model will collapse under what Marx called the weight of its inherent contradictions. Basically, the debt to value ratio almost guarantees the collapse of the whole system. And of course, immigration and welfare can’t be ignored either. Ony a fool would want to be married to this oaf of a business model.\nSo when Remainers are bleating on about Brexit they need to think about global trade and in particular the role of global trade healing the world and bringing peace by spreading a business model based on Contract, Choice and Consent to places in the world that are familiar only with coercion, control and corruption. Remainers are shamelessly counter-revolutionary and just like the arranged marriage that fails we all need to move on and remain friends rather than dishing out a “bit of fist”.\n18.10.16 1 Billion pounds wasted on “troubled families”! Well who would have thought that would happen? But the question is; does social justice have to involve social and economic waste?\nSocial and economic justice are two sides of the same coin. But in public-sector controlled Britain does the solution to asymmetrical economic advantage have to involve government naivety and a wasted budget of £1Bn. We look at “social and economic justice”. They are very connected but have been separated for “political” reasons for too long.\n“Justice” isn’t just about crime and punishment indeed this association comes some way behind the justice of economic advantage and disadvantage. Unfortunately for people today the government and their public school, classically educated advisers have no clue as to how their lofty social positions both underscore economic disadvantage but also their ideas offend the working person’s notion of justice in its broadest sense.\nYou may ask; how so? Well firstly the advisors are well educated and as a result well paid within the comforting security of the public sector. A security that the rest of us don’t enjoy but, and here is the rub, we pay for. They can scan the social environment from their detached social and economic positions simultaneously being both “kept” by the state but also tasked to critique the lives of others “kept” by the state. The difference is the wealth or asymmetrical nature of the wealth between the assessed and the assessors. This probably explains the preoccupation with money as the key to solving the “troubled families” issue. Giving people who waste money on drink and drugs, tattoos etc more money and stuff, doesn’t seem like much of a well……….good call. Only a well educated isolated and remote group could come up with the idea that money, that root of all evil, could solve this intergenerational, complex yet seemingly intractable problem. It is a problem that affects immigration, social and political opportunity for the poor, and ultimately getting the right people into the influential jobs, regardless of background. It really isn’t the case that only the posh, well-educated or wealthy should determine social policy.\nWe have said it before we need an army of foster carers to promote the interests of the offspring of the poor in the face of the patronising incompetence of the well educated wealthy public sector elite as reflected in the “troubled families initiative”. 1 Bn should do it but only if spent in the right way and not the “troubled families”way.",

Should we develop the hub of global history ?\nIs this a daft idea or isn’t it? It depends like most things on perspective. To the unenlightened, the question might be about what exactly is Boston’s role in any hub of world history. Others may argue that the history itself is shaming and should not be celebrated.\nWe believe that Britain in the 17th and 18th century laid down the global foundations of what was essentially a liberal bourgeois revolution. It was this revolution more than anything else which established freedom based on the commercial freedoms of Contract, Choice and Consent. These commercial freedoms have legitimately acquired a social character and therefore define our lives in a positive and liberating way. They underpin the politics of identity.\nIf we care enough to look we can see where these freedoms are absent and if we are clever enough we can see how the absence of these freedoms distorts societies or distinct communities within society, restricting rights for many including women and the poor.\nThe economic and religious freedoms that the Pilgrim Fathers and celebrated Bostonians took to America (from Plymouth, not Boston just to be accurate)laid the foundation for the Capitalist powerhouse that became the USA. Whilst these freedoms are not sufficient to create a just society you can’t have a just society without them. They are therefore an essential ingredient of any nation that wants to call itself “free”.\nSo in the age of the internet and the decline of the town centre, Boston like the whole of Britain needs to work on it’s global narrative its Unique Selling Point, and place itself foursquare at the heart of one of the most transformational periods in world history, the revolution in freedom delivered to the world in the 17th and 18th century by Briton’s and Bostonians alike.\nBoston’s contribution to the world can be drawn on a flowchart of world history and can be linked to other British towns and foreign nations.

The players were like bankers and lawyers mere flunkies of the capitalist. At that time the political system was set up to efficiently manage the capitalist economy and ensure the competing needs of the big players, the landowners and men of capital, could have their differences reconciled without taking up arms. The whole process worked so well that by the 1750’s the British Empire spanned the globe bringing trade that would eventually liberate people from poverty and disease.\nThe 17th and 18th centuries were the period when a free people and a free capitalist class drove up economic value in such vast amounts that London was so wealthy it became a city of expensive architectural marvels. The Law Courts in London, the Naval HQ at Greenwich from where the Empire was policed and the end of slavery enforced, and of course Parliament itself. The Capitalist political model was adopted elsewhere in the world, notably the UAS signifying the success of the Bourgeois revolution…..or as it is known in Britain the “Glorious Revolution”.\nPoliticians were there to promote and protect this capitalist model and secure its future. The Monarch has by this time acquired a purely symbolic function and has discharged this role competently right up to the present day. And long may that part of the State continue. It is the least problematic part of the British State by a country mile.\nThe problem is that the capitalist model is now defunct! Lets stop there and think about that. How is the capitalist system defunct? Well to be capitalist, capitalism has to produce economic value by combining things like land and labour thus creating Goods and resources that can be traded for money. This money builds up as wealth. This wealth enables the rich to pay taxes and the state to function in the interests of the economic players the Capitalist and Landowners, and by the 20th century the workers too. If we accept this definition of capitalism, capitalism has had its heyday and has been replaced by the debt dependent “free market”.\nThe free market was an important element of the Capitalist system. Based on Contract, Choice and Consent it allowed “trade” to flourish. However without the economic underbelly of “capitalism” it has spawned a virulent form of immoral consumerism driven by debt. This consumerism is unsustainable, planet destroying and will eventually, like capitalism itself fail spectacularly. When this happens, and unless we prepare for a properly democratic “managed decline” involving ordinary people making decisions about their future, we are likely to lose the elements of Contract, Choice and Consent that were the kingpin of the last three hundred years of trade, freedom and democracy and find ourselves governed by an indifferent elite. Worse than now trust us!\nSo how do our modern western politicians fit into this doomsday scenario? Well as we said at the beginning they were originally there to promote the interests of the bourgeois economy and that bourgeois economy paid for the state and therefore paid them and those who administered the State.\nNow of course the State pays for them with no bourgeois economy paying for the state. The State pays for almost everything else too. To meet its obligations the State relies on debt.\nWith the State indebting us up to our ears and ordinary taxpayers indebted up to their ears too, paying taxes on a salary that relatively speaking would have been too low to tax by 18th century standards, we are all paying hand over fist to keep a political, public sector and “free market elite” in well remunerated work but for no discernible reason. Frankly the old the young the taxpayer the planet and the indebted can no longer afford to support this outdated system.\nBlue Revolution says “move over State elite and let the people take over, it’s our country and it’s our planet”.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_marx-or-lenin-socialism-democracy-and-the-state/content_47.html": "Marx or Lenin? Socialism, Democracy and the State.\nMarx or Lenin. Socialism, Democracy and the State.\nMarxism has evolved, not only because of a fashion for different interpretations but because of changing material realities, making large parts irrelevant or requiring radical reinterpretation. Marx was writing in the early to mid-nineteenth century a world quite different from the western world of today.\nWithin that nineteenth-century world, Marx saw growing economic and social injustice and whilst at times his analysis could be obscure or overly complicated the general theme of all his work is to promote four fundamental revolutionary ideas, the easiest to understand are the liberation of the working class from ‘exploitation’ by capitalists, equalising the distribution of wealth and time, and the withering away of the state. The fourth the collective ownership of the means of production is far more complicated but is relevant to how the ‘socialist’ experiments in Russia and China were framed. I will deal with this fourth Marxist aim separately when examining Lenin’s legacy of authoritarianism. I will conclude by describing what the first three of Marx and Engels aims might look like today as capitalism goes into, yet another crisis and this time the working people must be empowered to help save the free market and by extending democracy bring about the socialism of Marx as opposed to the authoritarian socialism of Lenin.\nWho was Marx?\nKarl Marx was a German polymath, revolutionary, philosopher, economist, and linguist. He was middle class, which meant he understood the values of other middle-class people whom he later termed the bourgeoisie. Marx’s family would have been petty or small bourgeoisie as they were not directly involved in the ‘exploitation’ of the working class. His father was a lawyer. The petty bourgeoisie, however, adopts the attitudes, values and vanities of the ‘big’ bourgeoisie who were the industrialists, banking families and business people who grew rich on the back of employing and exploiting workers.\nMarx having married young and abandoned legal studies for journalism would have become very aware of how exposed and precarious the life of the worker was. Having left legal studies, he became little more than an itinerant worker himself. He and his wife eventually had six children and no regular income so the reality of life with economic uncertainty, no healthcare or welfare would have defined his and his families ‘lived reality’. He was poor and dependent on the kindness of his friend and collaborator Fredrich Engels.\nWhat did Marx think?\nMarx and his friend Fredrich Engels believed that there were many types of ‘socialism’. You can read about these in the Manifesto of the Communist Party 1848. They dismissed these ‘socialisms’ as either idealist, utopian or romantic. The idea that socialism was about being kind, generous with other people’s money or harking back to an earlier pre-industrial age struck them as too simplistic. Marx and Engels wanted socialism to have some rigorous and broad ideological thinking behind it. And that it had to build on the legacy of capitalism, rather than merely destroy capitalism they thought was essential. Socialism was a progression from capitalism. They called their socialism ‘scientific’ socialism. Scientific meaning rigorously argued and properly evidenced. They studied human evolution from a social as opposed to biological perspective and argued that humanity was on a path towards ‘communism’, a return to cooperation and collaboration by all peoples the world over based on either the absence or curtailment of top-down political power. Marxist socialism was the last stop before ‘communism’ was achieved. It is worth noting here that ‘communism’ is never described by either Marx or Engels. How could it be, it was created by the collective interests and power of the working class, not by nineteenth-century socialist thinkers and intellectuals.\nWhat is Marxist socialism?\nScientific socialism begins by looking at the evolution of economies and how these economies fall into ‘types’ and how they then shape people’s lives and political realities. So, fifty thousand years ago humanity was tribal across the surface of the planet. Food was scarce and individual lives would be brutal and short. However, argued Marx and Engels there would be general equality with the only differentiation being based on sex. Even between the sexes, there would be little in the way of power differences as males needed females and females needed males. Both required each other to survive the reality of their harsh lives. This brutal but largely egalitarian way of life slowly changed, beginning in the Middle East around ten thousand years ago. Things changed because humanity invented ways to produce more food than was needed. Thus, populations grew and what should have been a time of plenty for all, became the beginning of the period that according to Marx gave rise to the modern age of greed and selfishness, known to classical Marxists as the ages of exploitation.\nBecause there was more food, strong powerful men could control access to it. They could create wealth by feeding people and getting them to work as slaves to do things other than hunt or scavenge, for example, mine gold, make artefacts and build monuments. Wealth was born and with it the ability of some people to have more than others. And with a small class having more than the majority, ideas would be created, called myths, to justify the situation. These myths later became religions or became ideas within religion.\nMoving on from the ancient world and over time the way wealth is created and who owned it has changed. But at the centre of the process is still greed, selfishness, and exploitation. These in turn give rise to inequality, unfairness, and elitism.\nWho was Lenin?\nLenin enters the story in the late nineteenth century. He was a Russian lawyer who came from a petty-bourgeois family too. His early life was influenced by the fact that Russia was still a country governed by a King, the Czar who had absolute power. In the nineteenth century, Europe was emerging into a continent dominated by capitalism and so had minimised or abolished altogether the power of their monarchs.\nWhat is capitalism?\nCapitalism was not a system of relationships based on inherited power and status like monarchies, it was a legal framework within which contract, choice and consent were the only principles that governed the economy. Within society, there may have been other rules and prohibitions, such as a ban on poor people having the vote or discrimination against certain religions, but the capitalist economic system was indifferent to that. Anyone could become wealthy if they played within the rules of contract, choice, and consent and in doing so found a way to exploit workers to make a profit. It was thus possible for the Jewish community to be active economically, something they could not be in politics, due to centuries of discrimination.\nWith such a minimal framework governing the economic exploitation of workers became grotesque and poverty, starvation, illiteracy, and poor health blighted the lives of workers across Europe.\nWhat did Lenin think?\nIn Russia Lenin and his brother, Alexi had been battling feudalism, capitalism was barely relevant to the majority of Russian’s. What the revolutionaries in Russia wanted was the end of the monarchy. Alexander, Lenin’s brother was executed for trying to kill the czar. What they sought was the kind of revolution that Britain had gone through in the seventeenth century when we killed our King Charles I, and France had gone through in the eighteenth century when they killed their king Louis XIV. Russia was late to the game of destroying feudalism and whilst in Britain and France capitalism was then introduced, this was not something that Lenin and the Bolshevik’s wanted. And this is the basic problem for modern socialism and modern socialists.\nThe principles of modern socialism are not Marxist principles. Their ideas are not based on evolving from capitalism to socialism and then beyond that, to freeing people from top-down political control thus promoting the withering away the state itself. Their ideas are about the state exercising power and control in the name of the people and destroying capitalism and everything capitalism stood for both good and bad.\nAs Marx argued in Britain and much of Europe capitalism had already destroyed feudalism, but Lenin wanted to use an almost feudal like power, state socialism, to destroy Russian feudalism and to prevent capitalism getting established in Russia. They succeeded in destroying Russian feudalism in the twentieth century when they killed the Czar Nicholas Romanov and his whole family in July 1918.\nBecause of Lenin and the Russian revolution, modern socialism is not based on the idea of revolutionary change taking place within a failing capitalist system, a failing capitalist system which leaves a legacy of freedom based on contract, choice, and consent, but on what you need to do to destroy feudalism and then prevent capitalism happening.\nWhat was Lenin’s legacy?\nBritain and France had done what Marx had predicted. The capitalists had destroyed feudalism and imposed capitalism, creating modern legal principles of contract, choice and consent but had been guilty of exploiting workers in the process. Russian socialists had, in the twentieth century, destroyed feudalism. This was because Lenin saw capitalism as so awful with no redeeming characteristics, they were not going to let it get established in post-feudal Russia. So throughout most of the twentieth century, the Russian economy was not based on contract, choice, and consent, but as it always had been, on the power of the state to tell people what to do and how to do it. That was that model for Russian industrialisation. Not a free market based on contract, choice, and consent but on a centralised bureaucracy controlled by a one-party state.\nThis model of the state telling people what to do and how to do it, created by Lenin to avoid capitalism getting properly established in Russia is what modern socialism is all about. It was justified, not on the grounds of overt authoritarianism, of course not, but for the ‘collective good’. This was a misinterpretation by Lenin of Marx and Engels view that the means of production should be ‘collectively’ owned by the working class. The state was not of course ‘the working class’ it remained and remains implacably ‘the state’. But in Russia control of the economy and the means of production was described as ‘collectivist’ by the state and it was the way the Bolsheviks controlled society. The Russian state was an authority remote from the very people who were of course the real workers.\nThanks to Lenin’s revolutionary legacy authoritarianism too often defines the attitude of all those who call themselves socialist from The UK Labour Party’s Momentum, to Antifa, the ‘woke’, the no platformers’ to the trans radicals and Black Lives Matter. All believe they have the right to tell people what to do or what to think without any need to consider people have, in the western world, acquired from capitalism basic rights based on contract, choice, and consent. Rights like free speech, free association, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. Contract, Choice, and consent are without doubt capitalism’s most valuable contribution to humanities long and conflicted journey back to an unenforced and self-imposed near equality.\nWhat might the socialism of Marx and Engels look like today?\nWithin a socialist society that comes after capitalism, and which is based on Classical Marxism as opposed to Leninism we can ask what would the liberation of the working class from ‘exploitation’ by capitalists, equalising the distribution of wealth and time, and the withering away of the state look like?\nWe have all but achieved the former with the exception that big corporations’ ‘offshore’ profits to avoid tax. Big global corporations (and despots and dictators) are the only bodies currently exploiting the worlds working class by not paying profits via taxation into our welfare, health care and education systems. This is a global scandal and needs multi-national agreement perhaps via the United Nations or World Trade Organisation to correct this. The second issue relates to wealth and time. This can be easily addressed by giving working people more scope to develop talent by making education or training free at any point in life and by limiting the wages through taxation of ‘talent’ who come to dominate or monopolise the mainstream media TV and radio channels. Doing things that you enjoy like acting should not cast some into poverty and others onto the Hollywood ‘A’ list. Soccer has the same problem. It all just looks so stupidly unfair.\nFinally, the withering away of the state. Marx and Engels say this as a progressive process, not a cliff edge revolution. It begins by allowing ordinary workers to both speak to and stand up for themselves within a democracy that places political influence right down at the lowest political level. Scrapping the House of Lords and creating a new ‘peoples’ lower chamber comprised of the democratically elected councillors who are elected at no cost to themselves, to local government, could be the beginning. They would scrutinise national government policy based on their real worker’s experience and bring the expertise of teachers and small businessmen and businesswomen and health care workers to the national debate. It would be an easy way to get the ball rolling.\nSo, in conclusion, when most people think of Marx they are thinking about the reality of Lenin’s Russia or Mao’s China not the scientific socialism of Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels who between them created the people’s, not the state’s socialism.",

Because of so called structural disadvantage we are encouraged to ‘take the knee’, to see the consequences of structural disadvantage in terms linked to race or maybe some other identity. Do people including politicians really understand structural disadvantage?",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-07-02-16-to-25-04-16/content_364.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 07.02.16 to 25.04.16\nBlue Revolution Archive Page 7\n07.02 16 The US and Russia are too big but its too late.\nBig is Beautiful or so the saying goes. However whilst from mankind’s early beginnings the birth pains of civilisation have been characterised by economic growth through conquest and the acquisition of economic value by force, the achievement of peace through ever larger and larger areas of dominion by one nation or set of values over another will have a natural peaceful end point within the next two hundred years.\nOnce all societies and empires understand the importance of adopting a means of production which maximises the amount of value created for the benefit of all people so more natural as opposed to economic groups will begin to re assert themselves. In this sense Scottish nationalism is an example, there are many others all over Europe.\nTo be a Nation as opposed to a rag tag and bob tail bunch of bloodthirsty psychopaths who steal value created by others and more often than not waste or destroy it, you need to be able to run an economy that produces its own value and allocates it with general consent. The alternative is to be either ISIS a failed state or the Mafia.\nThis process is basically what happened with the British Empire. It was successful at establishing an economic model that moved countries from tribalism to a form of feudalism under autocratic British control using Capitalism as the means of production. It was a small step from that to a vanguard of leaders envisaging the possibility of independence by using the model of capitalist industrial production (more often than not nationalised) to secure the wealth necessary to support the nation. All Capitalist and post industrial countries rely on Contract, Choice and Consent at every social and economic level. This is what protects their people and allows them to safely trade with others who share the same or nearly the same values. It is why women have been liberated over the last hundred years and other “lifestyles” have started to be accepted. Some faiths find it easier to fit in with this economic model than others but to succeed economically all nations will have to adapt and the west will have to tackle the absurdity of what we call secular westernism; basically taking the market system too far.\nOnce this point of shared social and economic values is reached there is nothing illogical about wanting to consolidate to a smaller independent identity (Scottish, Welsh Basque, Kurd or even English etc). The critical thing is not the national identity, it is the ability to recognise the values of Contract, Choice and Consent and therfore the ability of the economy to sustain it’s people. Contract, Choice and Consent protect people from each other and from government they also provide a framework for enabling individuals, communities and countries to grow their own social and economic value.\nIf there is one failure of the west in its response to everything it has or has not achieved in the Middle East it is that at no time did any one stop to think…..How ready are these countries to begin a life of social and economic independence free of the yoke of Saddam…. (substitute your own Middle east despot)?\nThe reality closer to home is that neither Europe nor in the US the “states” need the level of overarching “federal”control to which they are subject. With the basics principles of society and economics shared so widely (Contract, Choice and Consent) people should be allowed to go out and produce social and economic value unimpeded by big government. People are frustrated with western Governments; perhaps the surplus of government and the shortage of opportunities explains why.\n08.02.16 From Dagenham in the 1660’s to Dewsbury today ‘Socialisms’ appalling legacy of its treatment of women goes on.\nSome time over Christmas we seem to remember a very uplifting interview with Malala Yousafzai and another young female who was utterly inspirational. Both had experienced untold setbacks largely due to their gender (Malala being victim of an attempted assassination by some dustbowl fanatics let us not forget) both wanted to make a massive contribution to society through education (we think it was medicine but both were clearly articulate so it could have been politics).\nThe next item on the news programme was a depressing piece about British drunks at Christmas. Girls with no clothes on rolling around drunk, fighting and vomiting. The “pride” of British manhood similarly divested of dignity rolling around too. Its a good job the prospect of total war is now unlikely as with modern British youth as our front line we would be ………..well you know what we mean.\nNow we make this juxtaposition to emphasise that in our experience at a blue revolution we can have nothing but total admiration for Muslim girls and women. When they take a job on be it work or childcare they do it well and uncomplainingly. These people who could offer so much to Britain, improving our way of life, are according to a group of them who represent Muslim women in the Labour Party, being systematically discriminated against. Its as though Britain (or perhaps the Labour Party) were some dusty outpost somewhere where women are seen and not heard. The response to this from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to emphasise the fantastic treatment women receive from Labour.\nWell we have explored this issue of Labour’s treatment of women before and concluded that whilst in government the Labour Party “gamed” the welfare system to encourage single parenthood amongst the most vulnerable. As far as we at a blue revolution are concerned this is “ideologically” odd. Women, like men, are essentially factors of economic production or consumption these days, at least that is how socialists are supposed to see it; “workers” rather than biological agents of traditional reproduction, subsidized by the government on behalf of the free market, as opposed to paid for by the free market itself which can no longer afford to do it.\nThe Labour party view of women seems to be that they are pre destined to reproduce, so welfare must of course be available. This opinion does not apply to middle class Labour women who’s job it is to support their less articulate “sisters” by protecting welfare. Whereas the “lower social orders” are subsidized simply to reproduce in a moral vacuum it seems the Muslim female Labour Party activist has to overcome not just the pressure to marry and to reproduce but prejudice within her own community discouraging her involvement in politics. A good question at the next round of University Muslim Society presentations on “women in Islam” would be……can a woman be a Labour Party local councillor?\nToo many Muslim men it seems don’t appreciate mature women with sensible opinions who may wish to offer a sound view about life in Britain today. Too many Muslim men it seems would prefer women, legs spread on the top shelf on their newsagents (have you noticed how many newsagents run by Muslim men sell top shelf porn?) or stuck at home listening to outbursts from sons fathers and brothers about the drunken promiscuousness of western women. With more Muslim men being imprisoned today in Britain (08/02/16) for abusing vulnerable teenagers, the pathetic Labour party should stand four square behind Muslim women and not go into the usual confused neurotic cultural meltdown that servs the interests of women’s liberty very poorly indeed.\n“Socialism” and the Trades Unions have an appalling record of standing up to women’s rights. In the 1960’s in Dagenham, women’s wages were kept low with the connivance of the Trades Unions to allow the Ford motor company to increase men’s wages. When the equal pay act came in Ford closed manufacturing plants and laid people off because production was unaffordable.\nToday Muslim women are being marginalised by a powerful clique of males in the Labour party (male Muslim Councillors and activists predominantly) who would prefer them to put up and shut up, and again just like in the 1960’s it is with the connivance of the male left. Where is the new Barbara Castle to sort these pathetic men out. And that includes you Jez!\n11.02.16 Working at weekends. Is that really what the Drs strike is all about.\nIt seems odd that with the deal on offer the Doctors are so unhappy. Perhaps it is just that for some Public Sector workers in general and Junior Doctors in particular “Saturday and Sunday remain special”. Is this a “class” issue; after all beyond a certain point in the social hierarchy working weekends without serious compensation is seen as a sign of being low down the social strata (Mc job territory). Or is it the inevitable result of doctors being the most meritocratic of professional groups (possibly only tipped by RAF fighter pilots).\nOr is it as we would argue both of the above, combined with the fact that just as Mines and the miners were the Barons of 1980’s industrial conflicts the NHS provides a similar “battleground” today and the Junior Doctors are at the willing “vanguard” of the fight. Knights and Dames of the bash the Tories and their austerity campaign.\nThis campaign is however an example of how the “Publicsectocracy” * either uses or expects the Government to maintain generous standards of employment and pay levels in the Public sector. Standards which would be considered unprofitable, or unaffordable in the private sector. We know the NHS is excellent and it is cheaper then health care elsewhere, but if the ultimate employers i.e. the public want a 7 day a week NHS, they are entitled to have it as long as standards of care are maintained.\nThe whole argument is lost or won on who pays for the service and what do they want from it (the contract is with the public). It is almost the Google tax deal in reverse i.e. this is how much I will do and when I will do it and that is how much you will have to pay!!!\nAt many levels in the Uk public sector and beyond we see the largely unconscious but ultimately autocratic impulse of privileged public sector employee groups (from EU technocrats to local council Chief Execs) trying to preserve their positions at the expense of the taxpayer and or service user or front line worker. Why no one has spotted this contradiction in the system and why the debate continues along the lines of 1980’s industrial relations namely the government bashing a “vulnerable yet valuable” group of public sector workers, is baffling. In Marxian terms if the junior Doctors “raised their consciousness” they would see the real story beneath their own very well articulated propaganda.\nThe NHS and Junior Doctors issue is therfore really an argument between taxpayers, service users and a largely well paid, well educated and privileged group of public sector workers. The Government is simply trying to deliver what the public rather than the public sector actually want.\n* Those public servants in a position of privilege and control over those who pay them, namely taxpayers. A weak government is their best friend\n18.02.16 Are the white female child victims of Muslim grooming gangs victims of two flawed cultures or just one?\nSarah Vine in the Daily Mail writes about the latest batch of men of Pakistani origin sentenced to up to 20 years in custody for raping a 13 year old vulnerable white girl in a Northern British town (Daily Mail 12 Feb 16). Any one who has met men like this knows that too many (not all by any means) carry an arrogance and sense of gender and cultural superiority which is only matched by their embarrassing lack of intelligence and education.\nFor these men the girl who was their victim was like too many other young white northern women, worthless. She wasn’t born to be sexually active at a young age, and therefore vulnerable to appalling abuse. This girl may not have been too intelligent or well educated she may have had a number of health and mental health issues and was, to coin an all too common phrase today; a vulnerable person. Little to look forward to in life, but worst of all she was a female with no moral worth. Islam reveres women and mothers in particular; note the men’s entreaty to their mothers. However women and indeed men who are who are put on a pedestal generally come to harm when they fall from the pedestal. It is worse when such beliefs are embedded culturally.\nWe have spoken about certain beliefs within Islam and how these beliefs relate to women; often described as “the role of women in Islam”. The higher the pedestal the harder the fall. So we have a uber masculine culture fuelled with a belief that men are able to prey on women and girls who are simultaneously both desired and repellent. Such is the contradiction inherent in sexual desire when it is borne of lust not love.\nThe ideology of masculine entitlement coupled to the culture of blaming the fallen female (even if she is a vulnerable child) meets the scourge of what we call secular westerism. The culture of secular westernism defines people by what they have be it money, looks, status or any one of a number of shallow inhuman characteristics.\nSecular westernism breaks up families, causes people to procreate with little regard for their offspring, promotes governments to paper over societal cracks with “agencies”to make up for social deficits all paid for by borrowing and spending recklessly. It is a culture that has unrestrained freedom at its core but it lacks the kind of safe moral dimension which creates opportunities and protects freedoms and by doing this protects people. Into this culture our vulnerable northern females are born; the prey to be predated on by the entitled hateful masculine predetor.\nThe crisis in Keighley in Yorkshire is a crisis of two cultures both capable of much good but both perverted by the reality of secularism in the UK. It is sad that these young girls were not brought up to see their role as economic as well as social. Were not brought up to see that sex is not a tradable commodity, that sex does not deliver “love” but is a behaviour that outside of loving relationships is simply a proxy for hate and abuse. The west needs to examine secular westernism and whether it is from a faith based perspective or even Darwinism to see its contradictions. Any society which creates such low self regard in its young and makes them vulnerable to predators is not a society that has any real chance of successful long term survival. Trying to make good the damage done to the young with health provision is no solution, in fact it reflects the chronic nature of the problem. Unless we turn things around we are going to end up in a bad place. Just wait and see.\n22.02.16 Now we have an EU deal how Millennium proof and Internationalist is it?\nThe problem with “the human condition” is that we always think our existential period is limited to the one we are living in now. Consequently we tend to try to hard and preserve the status quo. People in the past did not have out technology or ability to be almost universally literate in the west and therefore were not able to look back and think forward and reflect on mistakes of the past and how they can be avoided in the future.\nThe ideology of the world needs to be forged around trade and we in the UK have so much to gain as does the rest of the world from the Uk leaving the EU and re joining the rest of the world in free and productive commerce. Africa, China India and the Middle East would be better off with a critical friend like an independent UK. Shaping values via trade with a contractual equivalence lost within the EU behemoth. We need to seed, weed and feed the world and Africa has to be helped to provide the worlds food value as the west in particular stops producing affordable food and continues to manufacture debt based wealth. In a world like this contractual arrangements around food production need to be understood by those with enough land to continue to produce food in sufficient quantities to feed the world.\nThe issue of the UK in the EU is relevant here; Europe is too complex to negotiate deals with individual African nations. There too many vested interests in the farming sector. The EU is very big government spanning numerous countries and cultural and economic expectations. The EU is doubly burdened by being governed by an army of bureaucrats, a collection of well remunerated people who, look every bit the feudal overlord, whilst around them chaos waste and squander reigns. As we at a Blue Revolution call them, the “Publicsectocracy”. They promote the status quo in a quickly changing world. Their survival depends on the status quo and the rest of the continent including the UK suffers for it but ultimately everyone else in the world suffers too.\nUnder the umbrella of the EU individual members have welfare policies which combined with open boarder policy or free movement and this combined with the western powers naïve adventures in North Africa and the Middle East mean that at the political and personal level life looks pretty chaotic. A combination of entitlement, expectation plus cultural arrogance and misunderstanding make toxic the effects of economic and refugee migration.\nTo cope with Europes uncertainty the EU promotes a regressive model for the future. With Chaos regressive models always seem to gain traction. Fascism in the Middle East (Libya, Iraq etc.) and North Africa (Egypt) slides back towards tribalism, Socialism or the “mixed economies” of Europe consolidate into the EU a form of techno feudalism as a counterweight to the fears of …..well almost everything. Russia has its new Czar and America has a Trump, all playing the various regressive cards of discrimination, blame and sabre rattling . The world looks slow, protectionist and regressive but the EU is part of the problem, not part of the solution.. The EU might seem like the answer but it is we are sorry to say simply a reassuring placebo that is swallowed out of fear and anxiety\nSo the point has been made here that the consolidation of EU is a natural response to a number of fears of a political and economic nature (mature economies and societies running out of steam, running out of new ideas, protecting the status of the publicsectocracy, advanced societies which are starting to corrode socially). Far from solving these problems the EU has created at vast expense its bureaucracy to manage Europe’s decline.\nThe Blue revolution is at its core about three things….Contract, Choice and Consent as the basis for freedom and moral responsibility. As any dust bowl Islamist what he thinks about consent and choice and you will see how they underpin only free societies and free economies.\nSo to is it with welfare, Contract underpinning welfare based economic or social effort…The notions of Contract, Choice and Consent, are the gift that we in the “free market” west have inherited from capitalism and with some slight cultural modifications including some necessary softening with “socialism” after the last world war in the UK (necessary then but not so much now), Contract Choice and Consent has allowed the world to speak together with the language of trade and commerce thus escaping tribalism, feudalism, Imperialism, discrimination and oppression.\nThe concepts of Contract Choice and Consent protects everyone. If the relationship between governments and their people is also based on them diverse individuals within diverse countries can trade and contract safely be they male, female, disabled, able bodied, gay, straight, or fluid gender, Hindu, Christian, or Jew, Muslim, me or you.\nIf the EU were a “safe” place to be, the Uk should be able to re negotiate its contract with the consent of the EU itself; leave safe in the knowledge that the relationship it has with Europe would not be adversely affected by the Uk’s Brexit out of spite or stupidity. Can anyone really see that anything about the EU is in our sense , consensual, contractual and based on real choice.\nA Blue Revolution has a long way to go over many decades to create the global ideology based on Contract, Choice and Consent which will deliver trade, equality and opportunity, but the process has to start with the slow and well managed detaching of the UK from the EU and the development of Contract, Choice and Consent and the moral basis for all communities, countries and individuals.\nIt follows that if other nations want to renegotiate the contract with the EU they should be able to (that’s a Blue Revolution!) Should the rest of Europe want to default to a trading only status and open upto the rest of the world so as to continue to spread the word that internationalism and millenium proofing does not come from an EU or any other “State” bureaucracy, but comes from a trading world based not on corruption, coercion and compulsion but on Contract, Choice and Consent….Vive la real internationalist revolution. Isn’t that something the left used to say years ago before they became the state..\n23.02.16 ‘Socialisms’ dark secret. It has at its heart intolerance and discrimination. What chance has individulit got with Big socialism?\nNews from Oxford University that supposed bastion of tolerance and open debate which reveals how the freedoms we have taken for granted to speak easy and openly on any one of a range of topics is being undermined by “ideological academe”. The Ideology isn’t based on anything as wholesome as freedom and choice but on socialism influenced by a large dollop of Islamism and its fanatical hatred of the state of Israel.\nWe fear for our future here at a Blue Revolution; We fear for it because we have government on a scale too large to connect with real lives to balance out rights and responsibilities, we have a publicsectocracy fighting to preserve rank and privilege like our UK Junior Doctors, and EU technocrats and we have universities that have “safe spaces” where it is not possible to speak openly about certain subjects whilst at the same time fanatical views about the destruction of the state of Israel are promoted.\nOxford is where the sexual politics of the transgendered community mix with the politics of sexuality, socialism and Islamism. This happy coalition of the red and the green is both frightening and perverse united only in respect of the anti Jewish sentiments expressed by both groups. Once the useful idiots of gender politics and the socialists get the Islamists their much sought after platform and influence they will have served their purpose and there will be little mercy shown. The safe places will become sanctuaries where only “sharia” will be spoken in hushed reverential tones. Exclusion and discrimination will be introduced and in the dying days of socialism and free market economics (with all its senseless immorality) mankind will once again allow itself to slide too far backwards to protect the basic rights of all citizens e.g. Jewish, gay and transgendered people.\nWe have a chance to do something about this as we can read the past and plan the future and we must preserve freedom of expression by championing contract choice and consent for all in the face of Islamism’s gentle but unrelenting onslaught. Remember if you mix red and green you end up, up to your neck,…….. in the brown stuff.\n27.02.16 The Chinese and US want to keep us in Frau Merkel’s harem. They would wouldn’t they.\nIt is no surprise that the Premier league’s top two teams the US and China want to thwart the ambition of the number five team and its aspiration for greater global influence based on its’s historic trading networks and high levels of global integrity. This position held by few if any other countries is based on hundreds of years of trading along side countries on all continents, many have through Britain’s commercial imperialism, adopted the Capitalist model and have evolved into free market economies. As a result they slowly reflect in many instances the liberalising social trends that follow this economic evolution.\nGreat Britain has tempered the excesses of the free market with its post war socialism. Whilst it still has to deal with the distorting effects of untargeted welfare, the rise in the power of its public sector, and tackle the effects of secular westernism, a particular bugbear of we at Blue Revolution; Britain is leagues ahead of the US, China and the EU in terms of its economic and social evolution. As a result Britain can act as a guide, mentor, trading partner and friend to countries searching in earnest to develop proper market economies of their own. Many of these are of course part of her Commonwealth many more are the under developed food producers that world population growth can’t do without.\nBritains truly international role can only be re ignited with it abandoning the EU and its bureaucratic self promoting and reactionary elite, thereby re establishing for herself a place within the world economy in her own as opposed to the EU’s right.\nTempting as Frau Merkel’s harem might appear, there is no dignity in being pleasantly seduced whilst having ones grapes peeled by a eunuch. Most of us would prefer to go out there into the world and continue to follow Britain’s historical destiny for trade and social evolution. This process was unforgivably disrupted by two self defeating European wars for which the EU was seen as a twentieth century solution but which is now simply part of wider Europe’s twenty first century problem.\n03.03.16 Islam’s long overdue appraisal. And some stretch objectives.\nAh…..come in Mr Islam. My names Earth…Planet Earth. I’ve been asked to undertake an appraisal on your work with us over the last thousand years or so. I understand you might be a little apprehensive but please, please, be assured this whole appraisal process is intended to be of assistance to you and the work you will I hope continue to do here at Planet Earth. As I’m sure you know we will be looking back at your contribution to Planet Earth to help establish your performance expectations for the…….lets say next century or so.\nNow then a quick look at your performance over the appraisal period. I have been made aware that in the beginning you were hitting almost every target set for you…….not easy with so much challenge, but I am led to believe you brought a lot of stability to our business of creating new human life and using our Planet Earth resources to provide the value to support them socially and economically….And more interestingly you did this in many parts of my business world not blessed by an abundance of rainfall and fertility.\nI’m told that our Chairman said in the early days you spotted the need to impose a set of harsh social rules which put an end to life’s uncertainties, tribal squabbling, and war and therefore made the most of the agricultural opportunities on offer here on Planet Earth. The Chairman commented that his plan to open up the human mind to “consciousness”, quite some time before you joined the company, was something of a gamble, but in many parts of the planet in the past and now, it has delivered incredible results, many of them down to your early intervention. So well done for that.\nWhilst the total chaos quickly subsided after your early intervention and men began to amass value, the need to exact harsh punishments to ensure the continuity of the social order controlling that value has not really moved with the times has it? In fact the way that your strategy crystallised various repressive regimes and frankly nasty cultural practices should be an embarrassment to you…..but something tells me it’s not.\nI’m sorry Mr Islam but stoning and beheading was unnecessary three hundred years ago….but today it is quite frankly an outrage and a perverse part of any strategy for building a just and fair society. It will be an issue we will return to with your appraisal objectives.\nWhy do I want you to change it, you ask me why I want to change I? ….well for a start you strategic approach creates a perverse set of confusing and oppressive expectations on women, whilst removing the power balance the Chairman wanted you to aspire to for both sexes. It gives men an irresponsible sense of entitlement and authority over women. Men… your men I mean, seem locked into a sort of adolescence and your women are long suffering and invisible. The Chairman is clear this needs to change.\nYes I know that Mr Christian’s department is total anarchy…Yes I know its like Sodom and Gomorrah and I will certainly be taking that up with him and that rudderless and immoral department he heads or rather doesn’t, the one the Chairman and I call secular westernism….but this is your appraisal Mr Islam not his….\nMr Islam please put your sword away…..I won’t appreciate it if I have to ask you again. Are you clear on that Mr Islam, and please stop accusing me of victimising you. I know you are a good Muslim…..No please don’t take this appraisal as a personal criticism of you. No no I’m not victimising you, please calm down. Put your sword away please ….it is, if you would let me finish, an observation about your strategy. I’m suggesting you perhaps have not kept up with the modern demands of Planet Earth having failed to accept modern ways of creating and preserving social and economic value, and that is of concern. Lets have a two year breather and pick this up after a class of water and some down time.\nTwo years later the appraisal continues.\nRight now you have calmed down lets us look at some other areas, economics for example. here at Planet earth we provide our departmental heads with the flexibility to deploy the companies resources in ways which are beneficial to our peoples; the Chairman and I have been disappointed for millennia by the way that you departmental heads and those below you in middle management have shall we say appropriated or more accurately misappropriated the Planet Earth resources or held back the capacity of the wider human family to benefit from equality and fairness.\nI can cite some examples; oil for example. This valuable Planet Earth resource was available to all but seems to have been stolen by one of your middle management teams and has been used to simply support the kind of brutal management approach that I have referred to above and which is in modern terms outrageous. Public beheadings do not motivate staff Mr Islam, they strike fear into our business partners stifle the growth of the human family and destroy freedom, initiative and innovation all three fail. As I say we need to have innovation and your team do not do enough of it I’m afraid.\nWhat was that what about Islamic State. Mr Islam if there really is a place for you in this company I can’t see based on the performance of the lamentable output of your R and D team. The return to the tribal anarchy that we had hoped you would deal with eight hundred years ago has returned on your watch. Mr Islam R and D stands for Research and Development not Repression and Destruction. What you and your small team of R and D adolescents are doing is quite simply shameful to Planet Earth.\nI and the Chairman are rather surprised you and your wider management team are not doing enough to challenge members of this rogue department for which I am afraid we hold you wholly responsible. They fail to innovate and fail to do anything with the Planet Earth Resources they have stolen aside from destroy them and along with that starve Planet Earth People. We want to see progress Mr Islam; your record on providing stability isn’t at all bad your ability to do it without causing fear and hatred through brutality and repression is I’m sad to say lamentable. I hope you are not putting your hand back on your sword again……No …Good. Lets move on then.\nSo far we have undertaken a “Helicopter analysis” of the last few centuries and brought things up to the present day. Now we need to go forward with some stretch objectives.\nFirstly some positives: you have managed to retain the concept of the family as a basic social unit. This is commendable particularly given Mr Christians team’s obsession with destroying it. However we need to see change in the following areas\n- you need to stop promoting aggression and intolerance of others. The Chairman has been clear; he created religious diversity; you have no right to destroy it.\n- You need to reduce the number of cultural practices which undermine the status of women.\n- You need to find ways of ensuring your department produces real social and economic value through real social and economic activity; rather than simply pumping value out of the ground and wasting it.\n- Finally you need to work towards embedding Contract, Choice and Consent into your department. If you can do this you will be well on the way to achieving the previous three Objectives.\nThank you for your time and in put Mr Islam we can review these in 2150.\n07.03.16 The publicsectocracy is the beating heart at the centre of western democracy. In who’s name do they speak?\nThe rise of the Publicsectocracy and its self interested exploitation of ordinary people is an issue of huge relevance to every ordinary citizen in the west and is particularly relevant for those considering the future of the EU. Socialism as it manifests itself in western societies post war economics has moved beyond leavening the more severe effects of Capitalism (from pollution to starvation for example) and beyond engaging in wealth redistributive economics (Nationalisation, fiscal and welfare intervention). Like all economic paradigms from Tribalism to Capitalism the prevailing public sector model works in the interests of the new public sector elite.\nFor any Socialists out there this will seem odd. How can the senior public sector workers operate in their own interests. Surely they operate in the interests of the public. Isn’t that what Jeremy Corbyn is always on about; Boss bashing whilst lionising the public sector be they Doctors, Teachers, Nurses, left wing city and town hall bosses etc.\nBefore we go on, we want to make it clear that we absolutely support all public sector workers at every level and profession. This is not about hitting the public sector per se but about exploring how the public sector promotes the new elite paradigm which promotes its own interests. Just like the Capitalist who was unaware of his “exploitation” of workers so the new elite is unaware of its exploitation of consumers and taxpayers….but this doesn’t make them bad people. Capitalists were not on the whole “bad people” just people working in a system that worked to their advantage.\nIn the case of the west it is its the public sector ruling elite who benefit from the new “free market model” and this at the expense of workers, small businesses and taxpayers. So we at a Blue Revolution ask; in who’s interest do they serve, be they senior UK civil servants, EU technocrats, the US political elite, establishment politicians, lawyers, Judges, Public Broadcasters, or Doctors? Well their own interest of course!\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the capitalist system circa 1900 and before needed reform. From slum dwellings, to dirty water and air the working men and women who had created the economic value subsequently acquired by the capitalist ruling elite were oppressed; in classically Marxian terms “exploited”.\nThe post war reforms in Britain after world war one and two began the process introducing socialism and began to shift the centre of economic gravity from the “bosses” to the “workers”. The process of developing a welfare state plus nationalisation enlarged a group of state employed workers who had at all times prior to the turn of the 20th century, owed their living to the taxes paid by the wealthy, a wealthy who in turn had exploited the workers to acquire the wealth from which the taxes were paid.\nUnderpinning the employment of this group who at the top consisted of top civil servants and Judges right down to police constables or nurses was the idea that they operated within the paradigm of the ruling elite and were there to promote that paradigm. So for example law was about property, health was about getting the worker back to work, and the military was about pursuing global economic ambition.\nThis process was weakened after the second world war to the point where by the mid 1970’s the workers could bring companies and governments to their knees. The concept of the “elite” and with it their paradigm began to shift. Away from the “capitalists” the paradigm moved from the production of economic value by the application of “capitalist” concepts such as economic production based on value, price and profit, to the consumption of wealth via wages, debt and welfare. As the production of actual economic value declined (much of the value was by mid 2000’s produced in China) the west had to create a new “post industrial” paradigm. This was Christened the Clinton/Blair “third way”. Essentially the confidence to live and spend beyond our means.\nThis is essentially what we still have now, even after the banking crisis; a mature economic model based on consumption. the “elite” are those who can consume the most. Consumption of wealth has little to do with the production of value. No one is creating enough value to pay for our social structures of which the public sector is now the larges element.\nSo when we asked in who’s interests do the “publicsectocracy” operate, it is in their own interest. They are not acting on behalf of any other elite…there is no other elite. Bankers promote debt, people get into debt, governments borrow and spend money and the ordinary “workers” acquire a small part of the debt as wages as or welfare and then spend it on consumption.\nThe publicsectocracy get a good chunk of this debt paid to them in super salaries by governments who take the money from workers in taxes. However what do the ordinary people get for their taxation.\nLawyers limit justice by not reducing their fees, Doctors demand more money whilst we all get fat, Judges let terrorists “remain”, MP’s vote themselves pay rises, and the EU f****s up just about everything, and the whole merry-go-round of uber consumption does another debt funded rotation.\nNo one cares, no one is meeting the moral, economic or social needs of ordinary people, the moral nightmare of being “ordinary” goes on(Just watch “Grimsby”) as people borrow more just to keep up.\nHowever whilst this elite “moral paradigm” is undermining the moral landscape of the ordinary person, it is not guilty of promoting the needs of any other elite. s we have said above they are promoting the interests of themselves, the the new public sector elite…… devoid of any moral substance other than to consume, for them life remains grand and will continue to as long as the debt can be re scheduled.\n10.03.16 The EU makes money available to stimulate growth. How legitimate is his morally and are they just financing consumption?\nWe have previously referred to the toxicity of the publicsectocracy’s iron grip on the economy (although definition of the term Publicsectocracy is still evolving given this is a newly minted term).\nWe at a Blue Revolution argue that if you can’t see the corrosive effects of the QE, tax, borrow and spend approach to economics as practiced by the consumption hungry western economies, then you probably have far too much faith in the ability of governments and central banks to stimulate real growth via “production”.\nThe reality is that the new money borrowed and spent simply gets used to stimulate immediate consumption with no descernable long term benefit to the economy through increased domestic production. This applies even with “capital projects”. The model is flawed, it can’t really work and if it does “appear to work” it is really just smoke and mirrors.\nThe debt, to fund spending approach to “growth”, which fails and fails again, is promoted due to both the economic illiteracy of politicians, as well as the insatiable demand by “the public” to “consume” on a very personal level.\nPoliticians are happy to play thick…so they can go on stimulating consumption to make people happy and willing to vote for them. The public sector elite facilitate, collude, promote and fund this flawed economic model in the hope that at sometime in the future the model will really work; Guys it won’t. The alternative to this is hard and could go badly wrong for example allowing the rich to hoard wealth. These risks can be dealt with however by limiting the amount of wealth floating around looking for a rich persons bank account in which to settle. Remember not only is all property debt but their wealth (the wealthy that is like Trump) owe their wealth to your debt.\nIt is therefore not more consumption which western economies need ( most people are better understood as “consumers” rather than citizens these days and you can measure this by their girth). Economies need producers and in particular producers of food, energy and products with high value. Economies need food production and leading edge products …not easily done in a Europe full up with people and with insufficient land to feed its large and gorging population and with educational standards in freefall. Using free market economics to deliver food for the world via multi nation collaboration (as opposed to EU restrictions) is clearly and self evidently the key to success for all. There are other advantages too. A plurality in food production and multi national collaboration reduces the “risk” to food supply.\nGoing further still as economic determinists we argue economics and morality are linked. So many global economic problems could be overcome if the world was able to go further promoting productive land use with land currently controlled by the mad men of ISIS and their Boko Harem colleagues, as well as land under used due to restrictive trading practices. Economics could do a lot to neutralise the fanatics, if economics and actual production drove economic value and based on them social values of Contract, Choice and Consent. As we see too often dust bowl Islamism is stifling free economics and rendering too much of the African continent a war zone, therefore the problem is that free market Economics are being stifled by religious fanatics and this is prevented the evolution of modern social values.\nIn the west the problem is different but still linked to economics. In the west it is the perverse outcomes of free market economy that is driving anger and apathy; alienation in classical Marxian terms (i.e. divorce, loneliness, drug misuse and unemployment).\nIn the west it is not religious fanatics and their wars, but the moral framework that free market economics delivers, that adds to the west’s difficulties and drives government policy. In the west what happens is that debt and spending drive consumption and this is the economic “context” upon which western values and morality are based. This is the context that drives expectation, entitlement, hatred and greed in equal measure. It fuels the migrant crisis too.\nWhilst the economics of the 21st century West are clearly “shonky”, for us economic determinists at a Blue Revolution the real problem with “shonky” economics is that it eventually translates into ” shonky social values and poor public morality”. This works on the basis of an almost iron law of socio economics which we can illustrate with a simple history lesson spanning five or more thousand years.\nTribal societies are heavily coded and gender based. Values or social justice is differential and often delivered depending on age, gender and tribal position. In feudal systems the rank structure is reinforced by arrangements for power and succession. Whilst power is wielded by males, the females associated with those males have rank too. The day to day morality is determined by the ruling group and reinforces a moral code which maintains the status quo. Faith is used to reinforce the “natural order”. The rules are there to be followed and any deviation is met with a violent response (Britain c1400 to 1700, Saudi Arabia now).\nCapitalism changes the rules again. The application of uncompromising morality weakens progressively as capitalism matures and a shift occurs towards abstract concepts like Consent, Choice and Contract with rules backing up these arrangements. The rules of course support the ruling group by this time the owners of capital. Contract, Choice and Consent might have useful social application (marriage for example) but to get rich using them you need to acquire wealth and then the system allowed you to grow it by exploiting “contracted workers”.\nSocialism changes the rules again. the value created by capitalists is taken by the government (no choice or contract and consent here). The value is re distributed down society. In theory at least there is no injustice or problem with this as Capitalism needs some regulation. Even Adam Smith the father of economics recognised the need for regulation to prevent men of capital exploiting workers and consumers.\nHowever the story of the positive link between economics and morals goes off the rails at this point. The British socialist post war settlement was never “updated” so the redistribution of wealth eventually stopped being a net and became a trap. It created entitlement by welfare recipients and to manage the system, a burgeoning public sector offering higher wages than on offer in the private sector was created.\nState involvement also fossilised the hierarchical character of the public sector with its army of “leaders” and “Strategic managers” “Chief Executives” and “commissioners” all too aware that abandoning the model or even laving the EU might bring to an end the government gravy train.\nThis model of crystallised government involvement in the economy has coincided with another more damaging change and that is the growth of the “consumer economy”. As we said above people are consumers and with the decline of “capitalists” who create value based wealth coupled with governments under an obligation to provide public sector jobs and welfare to support consumption, we have created a toxic amoral mix of debt based money and an absence of any real meaning in life other than ” what and how much of it can I consume”.\nThis consumption based on debt model ends up being a competitive struggle to acquire as much debt based wealth as possible. The winners can consume as much as possible, and if they need to be consumed to get more wealth for example by making themselves available sexually, as long as it takes place based on Contract, Choice and Consent it should be Ok. A look at any high street at 3am on a Saturday or Sunday morning and one can explain the high rate of illegitimate birth. To be used morally, Contract, Choice and Consent needs a moral framework. The free market isn’t it and only Islam seem to want a fight. Islamism however doesn’t recognise Consent let alone contract or Choice.\nSo when you get economics based only on debt you get a culture based only on consumption. This turns people from factors of production to units of consumption. Once consumption becomes the only thing that matters, people will do almost anything to enhance their ability to consume, morals go out of the window unless the whole model can be re focussed around creating value not just consuming debt.\nIncidentally speaking of debt based income and where the free market lets it end up, the luvvies have been on the march recently; Jude Law and Emma Thompson giving us epsilon level consumers some moral advice about migration from the superior vsntge point of their alpha level consumption.\nWell here is a lesson in Blue Revolutionary economics; you Sir and Madam should in a just society receive only what the people who produce value can spare after they have supported their own and their communities basic needs. Your income should be residual spending by workers who commission your services for “entertainment”. However, consumerisms reliance on turning debt into wealth turns this natural order on its head. Thespians now acquire large amounts of income generated by debt and therefore your income is not residual value in which you would probably get a modest living but is debt via which you, like many others, gain quite a lot. That would make you a parasite in any other economic and moral regime. In this one you are a debt predator like footballers, Z listers and general slebs. Check your advantage…it may not last forever.\n15.03.16 Apart from avoiding the 7 deadly sins what else must one do to live a just life?\nLiving the life of a Blue Revolutionary is probably the only way that over the next 100 years we will avoid a number of repeating problems such as international conflict, human rights abuses, red and or Islamic revolutions and the resulting economic and social stagnation that will almost certainly result.\nBlue Revolution is also the way of life that if widely adopted by people of all faiths and none will stand between the twin challenges to future human evolution; total free market consumerization of everything or the alternative the growth of intolerance and blame leading to rules and restrictions. This is our Armageddon.\nIn the consumerization corner we have modern free market advocates including big companies and governments. Allied to them (a little like the people who support the “in campaign” for the EU) we have the people who see their own personal consumption, or the prospect of being consumed as a person (sexually or emotionally) for personal gain and who see this as morally acceptable. This results in Chaos. This is where social fabric gets undermined by widespread moral decay caused by too much “free market” and not enough social value. In this scenario governments get overwhelmed by the demands of their consumption hungry electorate. In Britain the “left wing” capture this point of view better than the right. The public sector becomes the publicsectocracy and tries to substitute morals with rules, the elderly are looked after by “carers” not family, pornography drives human sexuality, children combined with welfare are both causes and the result of the universal consumer ethos. Loneliness, depression and substance misuse both increase and drive more money into the hands of the publicsectocracy who create jobs and consumption but offer mere palliatives as a solution to this existential crisis.\nIdeologically within this developing context the EU over reaches itself and rather than individual countries failing (and getting the support from other more successful nations) the whole continent fails collectively resulting in total crisis.\nIn the Intolerance and blame corner we have a number of competing ideologies but the one that will emerge pre eminently will be Islam. In its Saudi form it will survive and possibly evolve into an appealing if rigid form of faith based totalitarianism (like it is now) but the context will be to allow survival of humankind within its context of social and economic breakdown. The Saudi’s and Islamists in general see the future as their empire and correctly identify the secular west as orchestrating its own demise by its failure to submit to the will of God.\nThe next most likely challenger to the rise of a coherent Sharia based Islamism is socialism. This however is a socialism of low tolerance and “collective” submission to the will of “the people” or rather the government as the people. This socialism will be a little like the Islamism we have described and like emerging Islamism we see the emerging themes of this form of socialism; “no platforming”, attacking historical facts with warped modern sensitivities, undermining the wealth creators and creating a “loyal” client state of submissive Public sector workers and welfare recipients. Plus of course the bullying of women in politics and education.\nSo we have our Armageddon, a clash of free market economics turning everyone into consumers or the consumed, supported by debt, and the alternative; a morally uptight and repressive ideology of Islamism or a weird form of socialism which will be devoid of the liberating concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent. This clash could be called a clash of civilisations but of course neither has much to offer modern “civilisation”. To avoid the clash and the triumph of one of these two regrettable scenarios, we need to become Blue Revolutionaries; people who limit their own consumption and reproduction and are happy to deliver high levels of social and economic value with empathy resilience and enthusiasm. Not too many of us around regrettably.\n18.03.16 Every week a further undermining of progressive values by Islamists and their left wing fools and fellow travellers.\nWhen we were children many of us would have enjoyed the dot to dot picture. An opportunity to learn simple numeracy as well as have fun trying to identify the emerging picture. It has become a common phrase in the English idiom that to understand something we “join up the dots” or if we are confused or can’t work something out we are accused of not having ” joined up the dots properly”.\nThis latter phrase sums up the situation with the so called “liberal” left who’s muddled commitment to “liberal” values sometimes extends as far as supporting ideas and policies which reflect a narrow minded view of society and in particular primitive ideas about gender inequality.\nWe have written about this before. On that occasion some Labour MP’s had gone to some gender segregated event and were happy to be well…. segregated. We made the point that a progressive perspective would surely be to see good relations between people as about more than whether one has a uterus and another testicles. Once again another British place of “learning” has allowed a segregated event, this time the LSE and the female Student Union representative felt “safe” behind the curtain with the women.\nWhen will the left wing in the Uk learn that by caving in to these regressive and discriminatory ideas they are simply encouraging the marginalising of women from politics, academe and the work place. The slow insidious promotion of these “values” will imperceptibly shape perspectives on women, on Jews and on many, many others. By encouraging the notion that such ideas are acceptable these ill informed left wingers are making the concept of “traditional cultural practices” (sometimes this involves chopping bits off people, mainly boys but particularly harmful for girls) tolerable. Eventually many male students will be emboldened by a notion of their “natural” superiority, supported by their prominence as the “culturally superior” gender.\nLet us not overlook the fact that to Islamists women don’t have to attend the mosque because a woman gets her moral instruction from her husband. The upshot of these views as we see in the North Eastern towns in the UK are that women will be insulted, humiliated and silenced out of public view and public life.\nThe “liberal” left’s lack of a narrative to deal with this, for them confusing situation, is rather simplistically because of the insidious way the arguments in support of regressive practices are presented as emanating from a “victimised” Islamic culture. Oh and a little more controversially, many of the people promoting these silly ideas are brown in colour. Not fat white, easy to hate men, but brown men who dress “culturally” and don’t like fat white men either.\nThe problem for the Labour party, the LSE Student Union, and every other left wing useful idiot, is that many of these men don’t like Contract, Choice and Consent, freedom and democracy…..particularly when it is women who feel empowered by them. It is really time the British left got the cultural dot to dot book out and started to join up the dots properly this time!!\nRemember next time you are invited to an “Islamic” do, just ask if is segregated and if it is, politely decline with the words….men (women) have nothing to fear from me this is the 21st century after all.\n28.03.16 Brexiteers should have vision and hope but fear is ‘winning’ the debate.\nThe problem with Britain’s EU debate is that it is becoming like most political debates emotional in character. It seems to us anoraks at a Blue Revolution that people’s capacity to think has been dulled yet people’s ability to “feel” or “empathise” has become over developed. This explains a number of oddities like the so called “intellectual left” overlooking regressive Islamic values and showing solidarity with people who look “repressed” or “under represented”…..sometimes groups should be “under represented” because they talk s**t. Lesson for the left here.\nAnyway back to the main point. As we have lost our capacity to think we have lost our ability to have a personal vision. So we wait around for leaders to have vision for us into which we can then tap assuming the vision feels right for us. We don’t thin about which political party will create the basis for us to achieve our personal vision. This explains the support for Danald Trump in the US and Jez Corbyn in the UK. In both cases there is little intellectual merit in their positions but they hit the visual cortext of the intellectually impaired and offer a feel good vision. The problem is both visions are intellectually incoherent. Exploring this is for another day.\nIn respect of the UK’s EU debate the same problem applies; the whole debate gets swept up into emotion. We have spoken about the EU before and identified ourselves as “Brexiteers” on the basis that big bureaucracy is bad not just for Britain’s economy but for the continent of Europe too. However we want to explore this “Brexiteer” position from a few we hope thoughtful angles which avoid end of the earth scenarios. So far the UK Governments position has the emotional heft but is fear based and neither visionary or realistic. The Big Bureaucracy case is a bit bogus. Britain being part of something with real clout.\nThe story of why the dinosaurs died out is relevant to this aspect of the EU debate. From childhood we remember that with a brain the size of a walnut and the body the size of a bus there was a lot of body to manage with very little brain. When a catastrophe took place the dinosaurs waddled a few steps into crisis and finally extinction. The EU is like the dinosaur; it is big and cumbersome with little brain to co ordinate a survival strategy for its huge body so it waddles into crisis by trying to preserve it’s huge cumbersome body. Smaller mammals survived, they had less body to support, and were nimble and quick to exit a crisis environment. Imagine if Schengen was no longer about free movement of people but the free movement of workers; the various more nimble components of Europe (Nation States) would have adapted independently to nip off the migrant crisis.\nThis immigration crisis is a wholly created EU crisis (ignoring Blair and Bush’s Iraq war) and there is too little “brain” to deal with it. The EU therefore reverts to various types of emotional response to the crisis, from the usual faux sympathy with migrants, to denial about the all too predictable cultural problems that arise when you combine people from a liberal culture with males from a gender obsessed culture based on power and male authority. Duh…..didn’t see those problems coming. Better just deny it’s a problem.\nThe other bit of emotional claptrap is Europe is safe within the EU. The migrant crisis which is as much cultural as economic is highly unlikely to prevent the growth of hostilities on the continent. People don’t like being patronised by a technocratic elite as they see their children’s progressive values undermined by culture’s that want to restrict opportunities for women and offer only hatred for gays, Jews, Christians etc.\nWe see the west has big cultural problems mainly socially engineered by well intended but self defeating welfare policy, but the response to these problems is not Islamic unless you have reached some kind of “critical density” and it is the only show in town. It will not be many decades before the Caliphate of Belgium will be a threat to the progressive values of Europe and the EU will not be a solution…..its cumbersome bureaucracy will be a big part of the problem.\nThe idea that drove the EU was post war stability…..the second world war…..not the wars in Syria, Iraq, Libya and so on and so forth. These wars……unconventional, immoral and frankly disgusting are likely to create an existential context for Europe within which our lumbering EU will have no capacity to offer solutions or to even in the long term survive. However it will have lumbered around long enough to undermine the survival instincts of the nations of which it is comprised and undermined their populations hard won progressive values.\nFinally the other forlorn claim is economic attrition if the UK exits the EU. This is really the most specious claim of all. Britain was a great manufacturing and trading nation, now we run an economy based on house building, debt and consumer spending. We have become over confident as a nation about spending beyond our means. A rather tragic position shared by the EU. If we want a culture based on values which are driven by an economy based on the progressive concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent (as opposed to corruption, collusion and compulsion) then getting out of the EU will be a liberating experience and will allow the UK to re build its real economic manufacturing base (steel anyone), correct its reliance on welfare and debt, and to trade as friends within Europe and the rest of the world rather than as a member of an exclusive but ultimately unsustainable clique.\nThere will be no crisis if the UK leaves the EU just a gentle glide back to social and economic sanity will follow. No need to get scared.\n04.04.16 All property is debt. Consumerism, the lack of an industrial policy in UK and the 1980’s economic ‘revolution’ explained.\nGosh how can so many disparate things can be linked? The fact that the word has finally woken up to the Generals and Field Marshalls of the publicsectocacy and their ploy of turning other peoples personal and government debt into their own personal wealth is great news. It has been going on unrecognised for years. At least now it is “pubic knowledge”.\nPublic service, followed by a feeling of having done some good, is no longer enough in a world where money is easy to create and for those in the know it is easy to get more of it to enhance ones value or status as a “consumer”. The most immoral part of this amoral system is that these tax evading people were denying their free, humane liberal societies the tax income necessary to remain humane free and liberal. It is almost treason in a world where we are only ever a step away from Corruption, Coercion and Compulsion.\nThe people who get the wealth are no longer the people who create the value (like it was in old fashioned “Capitalism”). Today all property is debt. The people who create the personal debt are also forced to service government debt through taxes (lets call them poor people). Therefore they get spun twice. Getting into debt themselves to buy their way into “consumption” and paying tax to service the debts incurred by the government.\nTo maintain levels of consumption (and therefore the support the economy) governments pay for the public sector on behalf of the tax paying public whether it is via health, defence, welfare, law etc. In the US the accent is on Defence in the UK it is on health. Each has its fair share of public sector “fat cats” generally doing a well paid job very badly.\nThe public sector is in our view generally no longer adding “social value” but its role is to keep the “economy” ticking over. Its costs are too high and the balance sheet therefore tips towards it being an ineffective way of dealing with the social challenges that confront the west be those challenges moral breakdown, obesity, stupidity, economic failure or what ever.\nThe Public sector and its leaders; the publicsectocracy, be they Civil Servants, Publicly funded Senior Administrators or politicians do however fulfil an important role; they consume a lot. In the west, consuming stuff is the smoke and mirrors of the modern economy. George Osborne can really play the Wizard of Oz, pulling leavers and pressing buttons to turn personal debt (including personal debt on new housing built on green field sites) into Government tax income and then into public spending and then consumption, with some kind of multiplier determined, on the basis of ” economic confidence”. How long this charade can go on? We estimate no too much longer but probably beyond the next British General Election and post a Clinton/Trump Presidency. And then what?\nThe other effect of this reliance on consumption is that people stop being citizens with responsibilities and obligations (e.g. as parents or productive workers); they become “consumers” and therefore take little interest in how something evolves (even their own children) as their only interest is how stuff is consumed.\nIf consumption is the purpose of the economy as it appears to us to be today, a government needs to do only two things; ensure there is enough money in circulation to enable consumption to take place (Gov’t wages, tax credits, welfare) and ensure that what is consumed is produced cheaply. This is done by exporting the value creating part of the manufacturing process to places like Vietnam, Korea and China.\nAs a substitute for real value, post industrial economies rely on the concept of “value added” to generate economic value……but this is a poor substitute for actually making a product combining land, labour and capital plus “risk” and then competitively selling it to people who have real value of their own with which to trade…..oh but that sounds too much like a proper economic model, and not enough like the “Alice in Wonder-la-la-land” that passes for a western economy today.\nBasically “Value Added” involves importing a product maybe “designed in the UK or US” and selling it. There is some “value”……but not a lot. However someone might get rich doing enough of it and then off shoring their tax arrangements as well.\nSo when did all this Alice in la la land economics actually start. In our opinion it started under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan. The concept of supply side economics plus the rather more laissez faire economic model which was the hall mark of those who saw controlling the money supply and trading freely as essential to good economic stewardship, came along just as the Chinese were by the contrivance of a “Communist ” government providing the largest proletarian army to western manufacturers in the history of economics.\nThe result was that western bankers came into their own selling cheap money to people who could not afford to borrow it, but in doing so enabling confidence based consumption to become the new “economic base”, whilst the productive part of economies shrank and public sectors and welfare expanded to maintain levels of consumption. Moral changes followed too with divorce and welfare babies becoming products of the consumer economy.\nIn the consumption obsessed British economy there is a British Tory government that can’t articulate what the problem is, for example with British Steel, or what the solution for the steel industry might be. Unfortunately since the 1980’s we have had governments who have no concept of how making stuff needs a strategy (free of the EU of course) and can also recognise that making stuff really isn’t just about jobs that can be replaced with a job at a supermarket. Making stuff, or growing stuff or pumping or cutting it out of the ground is about the health, intelligence and resilience and future of the whole nation. The real Thatcher legacy (and it is no fault of hers) is that in the west today, being “self made” does not have to involve stuff being made here or taxes paid here, but thanks to debt it can and is consumed here.\nThere is only so long that any country can continue to rely on, what we call, the worlds debt reliant economic “froth”.\n05.04.16 Contract, choice and consent the essentials for freedom and democracy Vs corruption (control), coercion and compulsion. Over coming the latter with the former is the wests big challenge.\nWe are going to do a full piece on “family life” and consider in particular the recent revelations about the attitudes of UK Muslims as published in a recent “Sunday Times” survey which confirms pretty much all we have been saying for 12 months or more. However by way of assistance to the “elite” who have slow marched us all into this situation with pop up Caliphates and Sharia within various communities we offer the first of a few suggestions by way of solutions. One of our contributors has attended a workshop on “communities” hosted by the Department of Communities and Local Government, however most of the suggestions made were it seems ignored; such is the power of the lower ranks of the Publicsectocracy!\nWhen communities with different cultural influences speak about feeling British they are not necessarily thinking about HM the Queen, David Cameron and his “British Values”; they are probably not thinking about warm beer and widows cycling to a church in every village, they might not be thinking about the NHS. Evidence suggests that they are probably grateful that they can be “culturally different” and be safe, but they would easily make things collectively unsafe for others without knowing they were doing it, simply by being dogmatic about certain “sensitive” issues that offend them. This is the challenge for the concerned liberal; how do we preserve freedom for all in a culture of converging intolerances .\nLike the British left wing who confusingly support Islamists (Islamist are not necessarily terrorists or criminals), the reasons that those with a different cultural influence support British values are potentially muddled and ill understood by them. Support for these “British”values is based on a general feeling that on a personal level seems “right” as opposed to wrong. This is even though an objective analysis would indicate it is naïve, ill informed and dangerous to “support” British values in a intolerant or self interestedly way.\nThe “British” identity in many who are culturally influenced out side Europe is less significant than many well intentioned liberals would like to imagine. Like “Human Rights” “British values” are narrowly defined and are used to promote behaviours that are at heart intolerant and hostile to others whilst at the same time self serving and self promoting. As we are only just beginning to realise with Islam.\nSo how to we address this issue of “British values” (still undefined) being used to promote intolerant values? Well for a start we can define not just “British” values but values that should win the support of all who wish to preserve freedom based on democracy and he rule of law. Because we have no basis for defining “values” we tend to end up talking about concepts such as “fairness”, “equality” “fair play” “freedom”. All these are laudable terms but mean nothing in reality and can be easily dismissed as waffle by those who wish to dismiss them when say describing inequality for example in the case of women. Equality is easy to dismiss, shorn of the concept of equal before god in Christianity there is no real equality here on earth. So if women and men are not equal so what. The same goes for “fair play”…. it is a nonsense term.\nWhat is needed therefore are terms which avoid defining status or position or which try to create the illusion of fairness. This isn’t going to happen on earth anytime soon. However we need terms which define relationships between people affording respect and authority in equal measure. How these concepts deliver a distribution of the worlds resources is for politicians but people need to safe with easily understood concepts. Therefore we at a Blue Revolution have come up with Consent, Choice and Contract as the values that need to be promoted if the westen worlds legacy is to be preserved. These terms which are unashamedly Capitalist in character underpin the progressive values that people in the west recognise and which have resulted in the freedom and democracy taken for granted today. However as we retreat from Contract, Choice and Consent as they are seen as not delivering “fairness” the world becomes more familiar with Corruption, Compulsion, and Coercion. These terms are seen from the Corruption in FIFA to the Coercion of women in British universities being segregated at Muslim Student events, to the lack of consent around forced marriage and modern day slavery.\nIf the west wants to create some clear blue water between progressive and regressive values western societies needs to recognise that before the west created the value that enabled democracy and freedom to be afforded for all, it created the environment where feudal corruption was driven out by Contract, Choice and Consent. The issue about how the value created by capitalism is or rather was allocated is for politicians and socialism has had a role here. But in these austere times the baby of the three C’s seems likely to be thrown out with the baby of “it’s so unfair or we are offended.\nSo in answer to the question above for a Blue Revolution this is the critical challenge for the free world. However people of all faiths might be persuaded that Contract, Choice and Consent are concepts worth endorsing if Corruption, Coercion and Compulsion are the alternatives.\n12.04.16 The decline in the quality of western life and the Islamist challenge to that decline. How should the western world and western worker respond.\nWe have commented previously that Islamism (perhaps in common with many fundamentalist faiths) is obsessed with gender difference, male authority and submission to the will of God. This is a series of preoccupations which have shaped the way the west and the Islamic world interact and explains some of the problems such as Cologne and regrettably some of the more extreme horrors of Islamism such as terrorist attacks.\nThe secular western world (secular westernism) is of course quick to point out that the west cannot be blamed for the Islamic worlds hatred of “our way of life”. However is this really a fully defensible position? Whilst nothing can ever justify the criminality of terrorism the hatred of the western world is a little more explicable. The west has committed a number of crimes against evolution which to anyone with a ridged and simplistic faith based mentality looks like incompetence of a glaringly self destructive stripe. The lack of structure within the family, the lack of public morality (immodesty and too little self restraint), the lack of submission to goals other than personal ones, and finally the reliance on debt and its transformation into wealth for the elite of the publicsectocracy (the taxpayer funded elites like politicians and technocrats) and big business.\nThe roots of anti-Semitism lie in the perception that turning debt into wealth is a singularly Jewish conspiracy. It is not; it is just how the system works for the rich and the powerful within the public and other elite sectors of the world.\nThis incompetent but “gamed”system which benefits the few at the expense of the many, fortifies the Islamists view that the west is a decadent “spent force” with no grass roots appeal. The up swell of general anger and dissatisfaction amongst the wests welfare recipients and poorly educated, many from homes blighted by secular westernism (divorce, drug abuse, poverty, debt and so on and so forth) adds additional credence to the Islamists view. Islamists see that in time these western economic “strugglers” will provide an army of the disaffected, manufactured by a bankrupt system, and for whom no government debt funded intervention is likely to solve their problem. Only a return to “faith” and in particular “Sharia” will solve their existential crisis.\nThe reason for the western worlds failure to deal with the problem of decline is that welfare funded by government debt doesn’t solve problems it creates them. people see their lives lacking the meaning and purpose that comes from creating real social and economic value; under secular westernism people simply exist to consume. The consumer is the means of achieving a governments economic “growth” but it is growth based on rendering human experience pointless, a little like that of being a pet..\nThis pointlessness funded by debt however makes governments happy and some of the elite very rich. Faith (morality) has, as we have said before, tended to reinforce the means of economic production and reinforce the social norms that underpin that production. In a world of little purpose and a swamp of debt-based consumption, morality still follows the economy and we see the results all around us. Loneliness, divorce, mental illness, illegitimacy, promiscuity, pornography we could go on. This is the secular western context that Islamism sees as so ripe for destruction. The problem for the west is that unless we change our new reality (by blue revolutionary means) the Islamists are on the money; secular westernism cannot survive and it is open season on what if anything will replace it. Oh but the EU is not the solution!!\nTo nudge the west away from its sub conscious but self-destructive urge we need to re engage western people in the business of creating social and economic value; Brexit for the UK, getting people back into value producing social and economic activity and breaking the cycle of your debt becoming someone else’s wealth. With this all based on contract, choice and consent supporting freedom and democracy there will be no fertile context within which Islamisn, Fascism, or any other ism can find a welcome.\n20.04.16 Wizard Osborn’s US Munchkins and the yellow brick road of debt based growth in the EU.\nIt is nice to know that when one wants to get some credible advice the British electorate can rely on the Munchkins of the US treasury. Men who have pumped liquidity into the worlds financial system to stave off its collapse, a collapse caused by the unsustainable growth of private liquidity brought about by the sale by banks of personal debt to people who could not afford to re pay it.\nThis handful of “experts” who like Osborne have identified “growth” as the sacred cow of modern economics have failed to appreciate how “growth” without value is toxic, poisoning the body of the economy; distorting wage and labour markets and inflating stock and property prices and shifting debt obligations to governments and therefore the poorer taxpayers. Growth has to be real and not simply an engineered illusion that leaves most people worse off whilst the publicsectocracy and big business get richer at everyone else’s expense. One of our graduate economists calls this process of debt turned into to public sector or business wealth; “debtamorphosis”. We like it but don’t know if it is original.\nThe idea that bringing this fanciful “growth” illusion to an end could possibly damage the British economy is utter rubbish. The EU like the US is dog knotted to this idea that growth at any cost is justified; even if irresponsible borrowing is the stimulus for this growth. We need value based growth by trading where the value is i.e. outside the EU.\nThe uncertainty that frightens Osborne and his Munchkins and the loss of growth that may result from Brexit is, in outcome terms at least, nothing compared to the predictable long term consequence of the UK’s obligations to the EU forcing it to borrow and spend to maintain consumption and the illusion of growth. Immigration is one mechanism via which government borrowing gets translated into spending or “investment” and thereby stimulates “growth”.\nOsborne is honest that by staying in the EU by 2030 there will be another three million more migrants in the UK. The real economy will not be able to address the needs of these people unless governments spend and borrow to cope. Like people who sell farm land for housing for personal profit, by borrowing to spend to cope with migration the government puts their own short term need for re election and to suck up to rich EU friends, before the needs of the debt burdened British people who pick up the tab for the borrowing.\na Blue Revolution recognises that Munchkins with daft ideas can contribute little to sorting out the UK’s, the EU’s of event US’s financial problems and the social problems that arise therefrom. So please spare us anymore Munchkin speak whether it is from Ford Motors, Treasury Munchkins or even Obama himself. As the Bible says “don’t take the splinter out of my eye until you have taken the plank out of your own”.\n21.04.16 Saving the waring barbarian world from itslf. Peace through trade and contract, choice and consent and not welfare and bureaucracy.\nThis was blank\n22.04.16 Obama and the EU. He mentions the war but gives away the fact he doesn’t ‘get’ it. Or maybe he does!\nJust a brief comment from us as there won’t be much that has not already been said about President Obama’s visit, but always wishing to make the oblique or obscure observation a Blue Revolution can’t be silent on the fact that President Obama (who we respect for not being a war mongering psychopath) has simply missed the point on the EU….or so it appears.\nBy mentioning the war he gives away his reference point as “the past”. He might just as well have said the special relationship and his right to speak on all matters UK goes back to the spanking the UK received at the hands of the US in the 18th century. The post Second World War era was about building bureaucracies out of necessity to create resilience and foster peace. However the aim of the bureaucrat or publicsectorcrat as we now call them, has stopped being that laudable aim (because we have gone beyond the need for it within the west) , and it has become to preserve the bureaucracy at all costs. This is a useless arrangement for the challenges of C21st and C22nd century.\nThe world needs to stop wasting value on pointless organisations that are not based on informed Contracted arrangements, widespread Choice and Consent from the citizens e.g. the EU (but not like the much more ethical Commonwealth, UN, WTO and NATO). Indeed Obamas comments about the US treatment of the UK if it leaves the EU, is not informed by fair play but compulsion and coercion. Really fair? Really modern and progressive?\nPresident Obama uses the words of confrontation and disrespect to Britain and its independently and truly internationalist people to try and achieve an outcome he and his financial and political elite wish to see imposed on us, irrespective of what British people feel is good for Britain.\nPerhaps President Obama’s and his replacement’s real challenge is that as we have said before the US is too big, too diverse and broke and perhaps there are worrying stirrings of a sort of revolution in the US, a bit of geo political disaggregation within the States you might say, power to the state or groups of states and away from the fed. Whether it happens or not is not our issue but no one should try and silence or game the discussion over here.\n25.04.16 With horror from both the ‘in crowd’ and the Brexiteers we mke our final comment on the referendum.\nWe believe that Britain needs to create relationships with countries that trade globally in” value” and have “values” underpinning their society that promote the social stability necessary to ensure the “state” doesn’t bureaucratize too far and therefore undermine the efforts of the economy to create real value .\nCountries with growing economies aWe feel we have said a lot about the referendum and have nailed our colours to the mast as full on “Brexiteers”. s well as the stagnant can benefit from trading with Britain as Britain can benefit from them, food security for us, ethical services for them. All of this would be premised on a trading relationship based on Contract, Choice and Consent; This is the DNA of all “free societies”.\nWe think that the EU is a bureaucracy that was set up to achieve peace amongs previously warring nation states within Europe. However since the 1970’s the whole concept of the “nation state” has been undermined by mass movements of people. Many of these people who share a wide range of views are not necessarily progressing the interests of women and others such as minorities.\nThe EU promotes the idea of mass immigration because in the absence of actual economic value being created via production of food, mining of resources and manufactured goods the next best way of providing what looks like value but is really little more than wealth is to create a debt culture. The debt culture supports welfare and on a national level allows poor EU countries to buy German cars until they are broken economies. Student debt and creates millionaires who using the process of “debtamorphosis” translate other peoples debt into their personal wealth. The beneficiaries are the publicsector tax paid fat cats, as well as the business people, footballers and actors who seem to be able to acquire wealth well beyond their actual worth. This debt based economic model enshrined within the EU and the UK needs to shift gear.\nThe debt dependent model will eventually collapse under the weight of its contradictions; most notably the fact it costs too much to run a malfunctioning multi ethnic society with an economy that produces too little real social and economic value.\nIt is true that migrants boost the economy but in our view the mechanism is complex and probably based on a mix of earnings, debt, welfare and rent plus house prices going up in the buy to let sector. Migrants also keep the unemployed on welfare. Taken together this probably “grows” the economy but it is not growth that means a lot in real economic terms. For politicians debt has the feel good effect of delaying the problem of economic weakness for another day or another election whilst being largely the public and the taxpayers problem.\nThe debt culture as we see with mass retail keeps pointless jobs open to….. far to many pointless workers. To change the model overnight would be cataclysmic but leaving it as it is, in world of stagnating trade between big continental players locking others out would be the western worlds longest suicide note, akin to drinking ones self to death.\nSo before we move finally on to other topics, leaving the EU is the right thing to do…it puts a nimble Britain in charge of its own destiny. It allows Britain to use its international contacts to spread the values of Contract, Choice and Consent supporting freedom and democracy to places in the world who need to trade and to come on board with this culture that promotes the values that will secure the future of humankind.\nA Bureaucracy might feel like it is a protective blanket but in the world of the 21st century it simply gets in the way of progress, fairness, transparency, and trade.\nNow lets talk about other things.",

In the past the solution to the problem of failing States was revolution of a gory and bloody kind. In Britain and the US and elsewhere, whole Nations of people are struggling to find a party who is capable of reflecting the complex demands of the 21st in the way their Nation is run by their State. Nations of individuals all of whom have different demands and expectations, be they social or economic are thus being let down by their State. Just look at the long term unemployed to see this failure at its most stark.\nThe problem for the Labour party is that it is a party of the Socialist State, not a party of the individual. Marx stated clearly a socialist’s job was to wrestle power, wealth and privilege off of the capitalist and create a socialist State. This is basically what we have now, a State that since WWII has introduced a system of state ownership, regulation and welfare. However Marx also said the story concludes with the State “withering away”. This withering away is the transfer of power to the people. The Labour Party can’t do it because socialism makes it is a party of the State. It would have to abolish itself in the process of passing “power to the people”. So a State run by a Labour Party under Corbyn will consolidate power not give it away….Scary stuff if you listen to them ranting on.\nThe Tories are not wedded to the notion of the state running the Nation like an expensive ideological experiment as are Labour. However their pragmatism maintains the status quo in a fast moving world. Thus we are left tottering on the kerb as the rest of the world shoots by. The Tories need to grasp that being less ideological, it is they who are best placed to deliver more power to the Nation’s People. But they are unlikely to do so for similar reasons to Labour. Preservation of the party brand.\nTo save the British Nation, Labour need to get over themselves as a party and hand power to the people not their party and the Tories need to realise that the future of Britain and the survival of her values is more important than even the Tory Party.",

It could all be due to a little known ‘Marxist’ called Gramasci.\nWhy have our long fought for legitimate 18th-century values (bourgeois values!) of free speech and free expression come under attack from our 18th-century bourgeois institutions of Parliament, Church of England, and Local authorities?\nIn 1997 a revolution began, based on the writings of a little known early 20th century Italian ‘Marxist’ called Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci departed from orthodox Marxism outrageously, because he believed the bureaucracy of the State should be used to manipulate the working class rather than the working class rise up and dominate the State.\nThis Gramscian revolution has systematically undermined values for working people all over Europe ever since it’s advocates entered power. In the Uk, the “revolution” was initially spearheaded following the election of Tony Blair who arrived with a wide-ranging agenda to deliver modernisation for a Britain he saw as old-fashioned, prejudiced and backwards looking.\nWe didn’t need him to do anything, of course, we were well on the way to modernising our culture without him. We accepted Tom Robinson in the 1970’s, Bronski Beat in the 1980’s and we have accepted all sorts of “lifestyle choices” since the end of World War Two. Even so, many of us had to endure workshop after workshop in workplaces, schools and universities from 1997 onwards to correct our faulty thinking.\nThis was an all-encompassing interference from our state institutions. This secular theology was hell-bent on instilling perverse oppressive values in an open-minded and tolerant society. Hate Crime or as we call it Thought Crime, became a mainstay of this needless “revolution”. It effectively undermined free-thinking working people for whom it was not in the interests of the Blair/EU neo-liberal elite to have a thinking working class. The elite desired an “engineered compliance” or alternatively an “indoctrinated subservience” among its working people.\nThe Blair EU agenda had a multicoloured rainbow of “identity groups” all seemingly in need of the power of the benign state bureaucracy to protect their unique vulnerabilities from an ill-defined “mob” of hate-filled homophobes, racists and Islamophobes. Thus the “proletariat” under this system was “differentiated” Into the Gay community, racial minorities, industrial and public sector workers, and people of minority faiths like Islam. Marx would have spun in his grave. This would have been seen by he and Engels as the Bureaucratic state manipulating the values of the people and preventing the emergence of a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\nThe whole enterprise required “intellectuals” to maintain the purity of this progressive agenda. Maybe student loans were introduced to get the youth into Universities where the institutions would act as instruments of Blair’s programme of indoctrination. Blairs incantation of “Education, Education, Education” claim spells it out quite clearly. The “snowflakes” are certainly in the mould of Blairs agenda.\nHowever, the problem for Blair, Cameron and May is that this agenda assumed the success of other branches of the Neo-Con project such as democracy flourishing in the Middle East. What happened as we know is this, shorn of their feudal systems the migrants from the destroyed economies or Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Libya along with the more established Pakistan and Bangladeshi communities became outspoken about the failings of our values and yet could arrogantly promote their own values and the destruction of ours, whilst we are forced to remain silent with Hate Crime the alternative to our free speech.\nThose groups who oppose British values have no tradition of free speech or women’s equality and so have no interest in the Blair revolution except that it provides an opportunity to undermine British values whilst promoting their own. Our values we have fought to get for 200 years and to secure them for all working people, now they are under threat from our political elite. It’s all so 14th century.\n.",

When that happens like today there is pressure for change and then a revolution.\nToday we have a “State” that is indebting us.

The capacity of language to communicate, share knowledge and co-operate to change our environment.\nOur species essence is therefore different from lower mammals. From tribal times, we have had to deal with sex and cultural differences, differential treatment for those who were visibly different. In tribal times men and women had very different roles but there was a value associated with each role and women were highly regarded as homemakers. This is a period prior to wealth introducing power into relationships between men and women, a situation which is captured most clearly in the patriarchy of the three main Judaeo religions namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nEnvironment therefore shaped the way “species essence” was reflected in tribal reality. As Karl Marx said ‘man’s consciousness doesn’t shape his material environment his material environment shapes his consciousness’(9) As there was no storage of food, in tribal society life was uncertain, and this would be reflected in the ‘consciousness of the people’, who would expect punishments to be harsh with unforgiving Gods ‘in control’ of human destiny. Brutality reflects hard material circumstances. Act with brutality without the material circumstances that ‘justify it’ and it becomes merely a perversion, an irrelevant cultural fetish or an abuse of power.\nOnce storage of food happened and surpluses could be traded in pre-Biblical times, authoritarian system emerged. At this point man was set against man and man against woman. Stored value became wealth that could be taken by force. This point in history redefined people’s lives in ways that went beyond just their sex. They owned, created and consumed value in ways which could define who they were. This reality went on right the way through history up to and including the birth of capitalism with capitalists, under the cloak of employment contracts, misappropriating the profit created by workers. It was going on when the final collapse of capitalism occurred in the west sometime around the mid-1980s. Karl Marx said the history of humanity is the history of class struggle. The struggle between those who create the wealth (workers) and those who control it; the elite!\nHaving maintained steadily growth throughout the post second world war period by the 1980’s western capitalism was in crisis. It was unwieldy and unprofitable in its bourgeois socialist form, over managed by a well-paid self-interested political class rather than controlled by either capitalists or its workers.\nIn the UK, unprofitable state industries were damaging the economy. Trades Unions believed they were acting in the best interests of their workers by demanding more pay but by misunderstanding the nature of profitability and the responsibility of the state to act in the interests of the tax paying public, they ended up, along with the Conservative government, of destroying industries.\nPutting those industries in the hands of the workers would have been an alternative strategy but one not available in a bourgeois state run by a political elite and with workers who had accepted contract, choice and consent but who also accepted uncritically the bourgeois values of unfairness and elitism. Put simply they promoted a them and us attitude towards their employers, taxpayers and the state.\nIn the 1980’s on each side of the Atlantic charismatic leaders emerged; Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Regan in the US. Both held the view that the state must be brought to heel. In Britain it meant closing nationalised industries that were not profitable and privatising those that were profitable. Moreover, the solution to the western world’s economic crisis was solved by the capitalist system getting China to manufacture the goods and out strip demand with a planet destroying but inflation preventing over supply. Even now no one really grasps the implications of this as we have come to accept it as our economic ‘reality’.\nThe 1980’s therefore is the point when western businesses unable to excessively exploit western workers to make massive profits due to decades of state intervention and worker protection, went east and shamefully embroiled the western worker in the exploitation of workers elsewhere in the world. Were, it not for the fact western workers do not understand their role in exploiting workers in places like China or Vietnam they could be accused of consciously accepting worker exploitation under the cloak of contract, choice and consent, a process well understood by the Victorian bourgeoisie. However western workers role in exploiting workers of poorer nations is done unconsciously. The global bourgeoisie and western politicians know what is going on and maybe feel powerless to change it. What they have done is trap western workers into consuming goods made cheaply elsewhere in the world. As consumers we have little choice but to accept being global capitalisms fellow travellers. At least for the time being.\nAs a result of what happened during the 1980’s and 1990’s Britain and the US watched the right kind of things happen (economic growth/low inflation) but seem not to have understood the harm it was doing to the planet. The economies of the west began to flourish. In the UK, the heirs to Thatcher (Major and Blair) spawned the heirs to Blair (Cameron and Osborne). Each man believing in turn that this story of wealth, and jobs in retail or services, was an economic success. All this of course led eventually to the famous banking crisis and the taxpayer bailouts arranged by our political elite.\nThe legacy of western capitalism ‘going global’ partly explains why the first and second generation of ex industrial workers voted Brexit in the UK and for Trump in the US. It is because the economic changes overseen by our political elites has created an army of under employed or unemployed people who want to have good jobs and create social and economic value by doing something useful but find they cannot. Their jobs have gone to China. These people who are shown such utter disrespect by the political class are basically out of work because they are victims of the European, US and global labour and employment markets. Their redundant knowledge, uneconomic skills and employment costs cannot find a market within the western economy and they are too poor and immobile to move to where their skills might find a market.\nBritish, US and European governments however liked the success of the 1980’s model even after the banking crisis hit, as economic success generated tax revenue which could be spent on welfare, pensions and state employment and thus unemployment was low.\nThe political establishment now fighting to preserve the European Union established their current political ‘groupthink’ during this period, relying on plentiful cheap imports keeping prices low so debt could be pumped into the economy without a shortage of goods driving up inflation. It also helps if wages are pushed to the minimum wage by high levels of inward migration. This essentially Blairite group think has become the political centre ground so hated and distrusted by ordinary working people. It is a bourgeois socialist centre ground occupied by the majority of MP’s from all three main parties.\nHaving looked at how in the twenty first century we create economic value by exploiting the planet and poorer workers with government debt, we need to explore social value (10). The term used in the United Kingdom, for much of what is understood as social value, is welfare but this includes health and education. Welfare is essentially the government delivering social value. In our simple tribal society, the social value was traditionally woman’s work which may explain why in a patriarchal society it has typically and undeservedly had low value relative to wealth creation. However, this socially important work must be done.\nOur state has increasingly taken on the role of providing social value because of changes in the norms of society, norms once expected by capitalism and imposed by Christian belief such as the sanctity of marriage. But with debt used to pay for planet busting consumption as well as debt used to provide welfare, we need to get people involved in a debate about exactly what good is coming out of this frankly unsustainable model. People must continue to enjoy the rights associated with capitalism but as a western world we need to address the inherent inequality, unfairness and elitism which as a legacy of the feudal system was willingly embraced by capitalism and continues to undermine the poor whilst now taking its toll on the health of the planet too.\nWe must recognise the effects of debt and get debt under control. As far as practical we must reduce the expense of government in social and economic activities, freeing people to support their own communities. We must adopt for government a simple regulatory function based on contract, choice and consent intervening in markets at local and national level assuring the quality of provision which if unregulated could undermine the consumer or the worker.\nSummary\nDebt has been increasing since the western economy became unprofitable and production was sent abroad. This arrangement has been successful for workers and governments because it has made retailers and brand owners rich and has provided tax revenue and jobs in retail and welfare. However, we need to curtail our dependence on debt and start to once again create value both economic and social.\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary",

The first is that western nations exploited black nations economically which is by and large true and secondly that it is now time to correct that by undermining western values. The problem for the UN and the culturally illiterate white elite is that they are being encouraged to undermine western values on the back of attacking past economic inequality. The worlds current inequality is not caused by western values which seek to liberate individuals but by religion, autocracy and ignorance. Characteristics we in the west are still fighting to remove in some places.\nFirstly capitalism may have been a western ideology but it was only controlled by a minority of western people. Most white families at the height of the capitalist system, say around 1900 were exploited. There was no white privilege for them. Women didn’t have the vote and working-class men had only recently acquired it. Capitalism was an unfair system but it was capable of being made less unfair as workers became better educated and demanded rights that existed at first only for the capitalist class.\nThus the experience of workers improved as they were able to gain the vote, gain access to education, clean and safe working environments and could exercise the principles that underpinned capitalism namely contract, choice and consent.\nContract, choice and consent are the economic principles of capitalism that were slowly extended to more and more workers. It is these principles which are now under threat because the modern western elite and a growing number of nations in the developing world fail to see that whilst exploitation may have been unfair and wrong it reflected in economic terms rights we have now extended to more and more people. These economic rights have now assumed a social character and underpin ‘liberal’, personal and ‘human’ rights.\nBeing ignorant of the role of capitalism in creating individual rights is why rights are being undermined by an assault on what is seen as white western culture by the identity left-wing. Capitalism might have begun as ‘white’ culture but the economic and social rights it has created need to be extended to more communities and societies and not be undermined by crude racism based on ignorance of the role capitalism has played in liberating people of all races from cultures that enslave, discriminate and kill.",

We have a well-grounded belief that if the Blue Revolution’s views are popularised and gain some traction the western world will genuinely demonstrate the “progressive” evolution boasted about by the barmy left wing. The left wing, however, have no basis for their belief in social Progress other than it makes them feel nice when they think about it.\nThe problem for the traditional left, that collection of well-intentioned muddle heads who promote progress at State level whilst presiding over the growth of ignorance and squalor at the social level, is that their version of progress lacks economic fundamentals. It is thus simply utopian wishful thinking bankrolled by debt and state expenditure. The model deployed by the kleptocrats of the free market is based on debt underpinned by inflated asset values. The left doesn’t seem to even have this flawed model to deliver their “progress”.\nWe put it on record that the western hegemony will end and without a revolutionary overhaul of the State and its responsibilities and the public and their responsibilities too, the existing state, banking and political structures when they collapse will take our rights and freedoms with them. To us, it almost feels as though the elites are planning for this eventuality and so they have created places like Dubai as bolt holes.\nThe reality is of course that the nature of the revolutionary overhaul is as obvious to us as the tensions and contradictions within the western system itself. Basically, there is too much debt, too much planet wasting consumption, too much inequality based on wealth management as opposed to value creation (the old capitalist way!). This new western model feeds a free market that marketizes, well whatever. It globalises human activity into poor and productive or poor and redundant depending on what the elite can get away with paying. In the west, the redundant become an underclass whose function all too quickly becomes to consume and reproduce with little real hope of escaping this entrapping lifestyle.\nThe revolutionary change promoted by us will involve extending democracy to a much wider group of actual legislators, such as our legislative college or peoples chamber. The identification of contract and consent as the basis for all adult human relationships….(no good if you want to promote a brand of feudalism like the Saudi’s or North Koreas), and finally a State which puts the needs of the people before the needs of certain elite groups of the people as is the case now. This final point will require a small state that regulates and doesn’t control and a cheap system of civil law which deals with most disputes apart for serious injurious criminality.\nWe thus have two visions of the west in the 22nd century. One is our optimistic view of an economy where everyone creates modest amounts of social and economic value and shares it around and the other our up to our neck in shark filled waters view which is that the elite will bask in the sunshine of Dubai whilst controlling the rest of us remotely via a mean gruel of welfare and autocracy. The type; Saudi, Chinese or North Korean is too early to determine and of course, the rights of one-half of the population will be affected to a greater extent than the other. It’s what happens when you return to primitivism.",

Often this traditional Left self-refer to Karl Marx or Marxism which guilds their ideas with a radical legitimacy. We would like to encourage politicians and journalists to avoid giving this traditional Left the endorsement of ‘Marxism’. They are undeserving of it and equally, it serves to polarise debate around the socialism versus capitalism narrative. This narrative is not relevant anymore but the implications of imposing twentieth-century socialist economics would be as catastrophic on the nation as re-adopting the exploiting self-regulation of nineteenth-century capitalism.\nKarl Marx was as we are sure you know a political philosopher. His economics has over the last one hundred and fifty years become largely irrelevant. That said the concept of justice enshrined in all his writing has never been properly understood by the Left leaving a legacy of murder, destroyed lives and economies at the hands of false prophets and egotists, as Marx himself might have put it.\nMarx recognised that human beings have species essence, the ability to plan and co-operate in pursuit of the survival of our species. The energy used which he called labour power eventually becoming mastered by various elites enabling them to enrich themselves at the people’s expense. The combination of economic reality and concocted legitimacy in institutions like the Church enabled wealthy elites to maintain their privilege because economic reality formed the basis for people’s consciousness making certain values and expectations legitimate. Eventually, however, consciousness matures until in Marx’s words the power imbalances or contradictions finally burst the economic system asunder. This is Marx’s explanation for revolution. The word privilege has been erroneously adopted as a term of class derision by the traditional Left without them fully understanding its origin or their own Parliamentary Party based privilege today.\nIn the twenty-first century, we must view our consciousness as working people within the context of a new economic reality. The global free market. In Britain, this economic reality underpins an essentially eighteenth-century political and public sector built by capitalism to promote the interests of capitalists. The bourgeoisie as Marx called them. Applying Marx’s notion of contradictions, it is, we argue, possible to view the state and the political and legal system as trying to restrain the kind of changed consciousness (one of equality and fairness) that is emerging within western working communities and they are thus creating the very contradictions that if suppressed give rise to violent revolution. The political system is doing this, and it applies as much to the left as the right, to protect privilege and power, just as it was set up to do.\nBecause the political system and its legal and state-ordered elements like local authorities can’t seem to adapt to the pressure from working people for more political involvement and fairness, they adopt several approaches a couple of which in conclusion we will explore here. The most obvious result of the state feeling the power of the people but being unwilling to yield real power to us is to offer policies that appease. ‘If people want fairness, we will give them fairness….in fact, we will ram it down their throats’ you can hear politicians saying from Tony Blair to Teresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. But this fairness is not based on mass consciousness it is based simply on the guilty conscience of the elite. Delivered from the top by politicians in their party based political ivory tower and endorsed by celebrities and people with financial privilege, it is seen by the working people for what it is, patronising political correctness. Arrogant meddling in the realities of working people. It’s not a real desire to politically empower working people but an excuse to ram home concocted fairness out of a guilty conscience rather than yield to the class consciousness of working people and open political power to the many, not the few. The political class fear people power as we would restrict their power and bring fairness to tax-payed funded public bodies like Parliament and the BBC.\nTo differentiate consciousness from a guilty conscience we offer an example. Teresa May, Emma Thompson, Emily Thornberry or Seamus Milne might be concerned about the fact that there are poorer people than them and want the state to do something about it. That is a bourgeois guilty conscience. They will be unable to comprehend however that there is unfairness in a system that makes them so much richer and more powerful than us and that needs dealing with too. That is working class consciousness.\nOne final observation and that is that in the absence of systems that actually do empower people, people will have no option but to vote for the goofball who best enshrines their view that politicians need taking down a peg or two. The Farage phenomenon created by the BBC as a foil for serious politicians like Blair and Cameron backfired because people no longer need a Cameron or a Blair. People want more political power. Trump is a product of the same phenomenon in the U.S. People are stuck with a political system that excludes them from power. The same phenomenon afflicts France and the EU in general.\nPeople don’t want the guilt-based conscience of the Left and celebs pushing political correctness or the goofball guilt free politics of the right promoting Trump and a variety of other populists. People who in a truly Marxist sense have a raised collective consciousness for fairness and equality now want to have power. Power to the people.\nPoliticians on the traditional left and on the right need to understand that political change is in the air. Working people have good humane values and don’t need to be hectored by an expensive state run by privileged political parties. Making global corporations pay their way and reducing personal debts, will also empower working people. We want the freedom and choice of the free market reflected in our politics. That isn’t happening because the bourgeoisie of the political left and right don’t want to give up their eighteenth-century class privilege.\nBlue Revolution. For the People, not the Party",

Just how radical is it or is it both counter factual and counter revolutionary?\nThe world is a messy place these days, methods of ordering society which Karl Marx himself would have called primitive are promoted by the West namely, Saudi Arabia whilst the neurotic adherence to faith which in Marx’s view was put asunder in the 18th century by the growth of capitalism stalks the streets of London and Manchester inflicting death and mayhem on innocent people exercising their long fought for rights to relax and enjoy themselves as individuals free of control by others. This, of course, is precisely what the neurotic Islamists want to destroy. They want to control people by gender, virtue, sexuality, tribe, ethnicity, cast, religion and denomination. There really is no limit to the bubbling primitivism of these groups and their wish to control us and our way of life. It is as though they think the Reformation in the West and what sprang from it namely capitalism and industrialisation should not have happened. This, of course, is also the problem for the British left.\nCapitalism did happen and whilst it exploited the worker financially, creating the proletarian, from the bonded serf, it also created economic freedoms which were necessary for capitalism to function. These legal freedoms eventually took on a social character and explain why we have a generally tolerant, democratic and freedom loving mentality. We sum these freedoms up as Contract, Choice and Consent. They have gone from being almost exclusively the rights for the bourgeoisie to trade to being legal rights that we can all enjoy. Now the British left seems to fail to grasp that there are two sides to the capitalist system, its freedoms and its exploitation.To be just you have to be able to work out how to protect freedom whilst tackling what is still seen by them as exploitation. The British left, however, seems oblivious to this binary capitalist character and thus seem willing to ally themselves with those who hate capitalism or the modern variant the ‘free market’ and hate the freedoms it has created too. In fact, sometimes the leaders of the left seem to be so unsure of their Marx that they think it is Ok to criticise what they call capitalist exploitation with violent language or violent struggle, whilst promising as part of their revolution a mean clunking form of parliamentary redistributive socialism. Corbyn seems like a nice guy but the British hard left rank and file now looks and sounds ugly and turns a blind eye to the kind of discrimination that has no place in a once capitalist now free post-industrial society, namely misogyny and antisemitism.\nAs Marxists, the British hard left are very poor disciples. They are basically Leninists, advocates of bureaucratic central control and state ownership with the freedoms created by capitalism put asunder in the name of a state managed utopian New Jerusalem. To socialists of this stripe, the state itself is everything and the people nothing. These ‘vulgar’ ideas belong somewhere between 1917 and 1973 but please not now we have too much to loose.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_politicians-lack-integrity-but-so-does-the-whole-political-system/content_80.html": "Politicians’ lack integrity, but so does the whole political system.\nWhen I first became a councillor there was a standards committee. It seemed to spend a lot of time hearing grievances and counter grievances by various councillors some of whom used it to settle scores or take revenge for perceived slights.\nThankfully it was eventually abolished.\nToday politics is increasingly mired in petty score settling and grievance taking. So, I personally struggle to apply the ambition of this code of corporate governance as it relates to the councillor’s behaviour with the reality of our current Party-based political settlement.\nIn particular, I struggle with the word integrity, which is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. Political integrity is something personal, something known only to the individual who acts with integrity, and it is difficult to achieve integrity within our current political arrangements.\nThe public no longer turns out to vote as they did in the past because I assert, they know there is something wrong with the way modern politics works. They suspect when observing politics that there is a lack of integrity by politicians translating into a lack of integrity within the whole system. Yet we are required to demonstrate integrity and adhere to ‘standards of behaviour enshrined in codes of conduct and protocols. It’s a bit late for that.\nMaybe it’s because the authors of these blueprints for codes of conduct and protocols can see that politics as we have understood for over two hundred years is now failing, and bringing the whole political realm into disrepute that they try to ‘fix it’ with policy. But you can’t make a democratic silk purse out of a political sow’s ear.\nFor far too long politics has been destructive rather than constructive, collectively bringing down your opponent or their administration. It’s binary, adversarial, and polarising. The psychology behind it is childlike in its simplicity and is appealing to some people for that reason. It’s ‘attack and defend’ Politics for the playground bully.\nTo the political outsider, it looks self-indulgent, they see self-aggrandising, grandstanding politicians of every stripe as the typical characters of the political class.\nIt has not always been like this, because at one time there was an argument that binary politics was crudely class-based and thus tribal loyalty conferred a sort of integrity. Today this is not the case, politics increasingly represents only itself, its processes, systems and procedures, too often undermining integrity by forcing people to vote collectively often against their better instincts.\nAllied to this is a new and troubling phenomenon the ad hominem attack, or gaslighting. Because of declining economic opportunities and little actual influence locally, nationally, or globally, old-fashioned Party politics has to find a way to still look relevant.\nTherefore, rather than listen to other people’s ideas and debate them, we criticise each other’s intelligence, charisma, values, motives, morality, honesty, and behaviour. Looking away from policy because there probably aren’t any policies and therefore attacking opponents as people, rather than attacking their ideas is easy and is increasingly the only thing left for Party politicians to do.\nGiven the lamentable state of Party politics I’d say we don’t need any more, grandstanding political parties, or indeed a code of conduct covering politicians’ integrity, we need a revolution within our increasingly unfit-for-purpose 18th-century political system.",

The only difference now is that we still have principles underpinning our freedoms which were brought into existence by capitalism, such as choice and consent. We believe in the absence of proper capitalism, these are now under threat.\nA disappointing obsession with making money by “free-marketeers” has undermined the western working class. Exporting jobs to China, for example, or uncontrolled inward migration to do low skill work. It has turned our western working class into first, second and third generation unemployed and once again defined them by fixed social position and their gender as in the days before industry proletarianised them into a class. The term underclass is applied unfairly to these people, victims of a broken system. Only welfare keeps body and soul together but it is heavily gendered with having babies an attractive lifestyle choice thus limiting girls economic opportunities.\nAt the same time as work is going elsewhere, there is migration from areas unfamiliar with capitalism’s principles and thus hostile to gay and women’s rights and with a pre-industrial, irrational propensity to rage. Large groups enter Europe from North Africa and challenge the rights of western working and middle-class people who whilst in employment are being systematically pauperised (but that is an issue for another post).\nIt’s as though the political elite are giving with one hand and undermining with the other. This system of creating and then managing the effects of all this migration and economic change requires massive budget deficits by government and ratcheting debt but its bi-product is that it keeps the ex-workers out of the economy, creates division (note division not violence) on the streets and via gov’t debt allows the whole financial ballyhoo to run for another decade or two. Top jobs and Gov’t contracts funded from taxation with the odd taxpayer-funded bailout in the middle.\nBeing junkies for money and with no “capital” to trade the financial elite have to find a ready source of wealth from somewhere. Where can such sums come from? Well, politicians running bankrupt states and with taxpayers on hand to pick up the bill.\nThe issues that no one is prepared to confront is that the global economy is simply being ‘gamed’ to keep our kleptocrats in a style of living to which they have become accustomed, we don’t matter. The system needs to change!\nSo until it changes our governments will QE, borrow and spend and run ever-increasing budget deficits. All this money slops one way or another into the global economy and makes the financial elite rich, and we all believe it has to be this way.\nThe solution is complex…..but who is prepared to start the conversation.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_uk-socialism-we-look-at-the-economics-of-the-many-not-the-few/content_355.html": "UK Socialism. We look at the economics of the many not the few!\nThe many not the few seems to have its origins in the 1848 Manifesto of the Communist Party and therefore gives some credibility to the claim that the most recent iteration of the Labour Party is Marxist. This suggestion is relished by the likes of John McDonnell who can’t escape from the exciting psychodrama of class war.\nIt was Karl Marx who scientifically explained the process by which all property is theft, he called it “exploitation”. Workers only had their labour power to sell. The class system required the costs of children to be covered by the worker and a surplus workforce existed which would suppress wages. Between living costs and competing with other workers, it was not possible to accumulate wealth. Together these two features of the worker’s life interfered with his desire to acquire “Property”. Workers wanted property and could, in theory, have it but the wages system made it almost impossible.\nThe property, of course, does not mean personal property (Hats, coats, furniture etc) but property that consists of valuable and tradable assets like buildings, stocks and shares and gold. The process of exploitation identified by Marx resulted in the capitalist accumulating property whilst the workers essentially paid for it. By buying labour power the capitalist owned the surplus once wages were paid and this surplus value became capital and therefore property. This is why capitalism is correctly identified as ‘unfair’ or exploitative.\nNow in Marxian terms, the “many” would be the army of workers all of whom collectively were creating the surplus value necessary to provide the capitalist with his property. The few would be the capitalists who were benefitting from this “rigged” system as John Mc Donnell puts it. It’s not so much rigged… It just is what it is!\nOthers who benefitted from this system would be the army of bankers, politicians and lawyers and other Pettit bourgeoisie who were able to gain payment from capitalists by reinforcing the expectations and interests of the system, courts upholding property rights for example. Upholding the interests of capital against the interests of workers.\nCapitalism is inherently unfair and socialism was seen by many as the brief collective action necessary to enable the worker to claw back a greater slice of the product of his or her labour power. So far so good. A coherent idea framed within the context of the mid 19th century.\nFrom the 1900’s onwards the march of socialism began to address some of the unfairness within the capitalist system. By the end of WWII it was possible to envisage a “socialist state”. A landslide Labour victory after WWII resulted in the nation-state having the power to collectively redistribute the surplus value hitherto appropriated by capitalists, but this time in favour of everyone. The welfare state was born and there was a wealth re-distributive programme and Nationalisations.\nThis trajectory from 1848 to about 1948 delivered socialism or as near as damn it and thus, in theory, liberated the workers from “exploitation” by capitalists.\nTo be fair to capitalism the economic principles underpinning it which we at Blue Revolution simply describe as “Contract, Choice and Consent” have not only endured over the last hundred years they have taken on a “social character”. So we now enjoy these principles as a matter of routine in all aspects of our lives. In this respect, the efforts of the Suffragettes, Labour Party and the more recent coalition and Conservative governments have achieved excellent results promoting enhanced rights for women and a huge number of previously discriminated against minorities.\nUnlike social progressiveness, however, the economic unfairness inherent within the capitalist system was not really addressed by the post-war Labour and subsequent governments. Indeed the failed efforts of Labour to deliver for the working class needs some analysis because “socialism” did not “liberate” workers in any economic sense.\nBy the mid-1990’s the Labour Party’s appetite to deliver socialism was in full retreat. Unless one understood what was going on one would be forgiven for thinking “capital” had won. This is still the narrative of right-wing publications and those quick to look to the failure of the old USSR, but it is not so!\nCapitalism had in the West succumbed to its inevitable destiny of collapse by around the mid-1980’s. The racketeering free market was engineered by governments and banks to keeps its corpse twitching on the slab for as long as possible. Put simply capitalisms failure was because “surplus value” the holy grail of capitalism, socialism and beyond, was in mature western capitalist economies, non-existent and workers were now under the direct or indirect pay of the government and taxpayer who had no surplus value to work with, just debt.\nIn the period after WII state industries struggled and then failed to deliver surplus value to the nation, and in too many cases, the nation was subsidising the nationalised worker. This is not how the process is supposed to work. From Steel Yards to Coal Mines the workers were effectively taking on the taxpayer in industrial disputes and demanding a higher slice of taxpayer subsidy. This was the case with all the industrial monopolies and some of the utilities. This was the precursor to the “Thatcher” reforms and privatisations. Even Marx recognised that the rapid growth of capital was an essential element of the liberation of the worker. But by the 1970’s that capital growth based on surplus value was in reverse.\nThere are two possible theories why no surplus value was created. One is that the workers in failing to identify the nation as having the ownership of capital took on the “management” as surrogate “capitalists” and destroyed their and our nations industrial base. An alternative and the one favoured by us at Blue Revolution is that Western capitalism, even state capitalism in the form of nationalised industries, were by the 1970’s unprofitable and doomed to failure and eventual closure due to global economic factors and in particular wage and pension costs.\nWestern industrial workers were too expensive to employ and pension. Working classes elsewhere in the world could make the stuff the West needed and the “surplus value” would come by the interplay of global capital and global labour. This phase is our modern economic history saw ‘expensive’ workers being cast aside in favour of Chinese employees and others. Workers saw industries shipped abroad in crates and their children, intended to replace them in the labour market, pushed out onto a diet of welfare and healthcare. The State in the form of the taxpayer picked up the tab. The ghastly word ‘underclass” fails to capture the reality of these people as victims of the failure of domestic capitalism and socialism to deal with global conditions. And the 1970’s model won’t work this time either.\nIt is difficult to see how Labour will sort this issue out with its programme of nationalisations and debt. The whole world economy has become a machine for papering over the cracks of the failure of Western capitalism to recover profitability sufficient to pay for its State social and other obligations. It now costs the nations of the West trillions to make it look like capitalism still works here.\nThe substitute for western capitalism the “free-market” system requires state expenditure and obscene levels of personal indebtedness to maintain aggregate demand for products made elsewhere. Labour will sadly add to the toxic mix of debt and declining productivity with their parochial economic policies which can’t address significant global factors and would leave workers outside their financial comfort zone. This isn’t a thumbs up for Remain either, only Brexit gives the freedom to escape debt.\nSo back to the original point above. Who are the many and who are the few? Sadly within the current economic paradigm just as in the 1970’s the many will be the hard-pressed indebted taxpayers and the few the state political and economic elites and hangers-on. Not quite what Marx and Engles had in mind! They saw socialism and its aftermath as beneficiaries of global capital not sadly inheritors of the national debt!",

Often the advice is anodyne, be nice to each other that kind of thing and sometimes it might be a little less nice, kill the non-believer for example. These theologians will, of course, argue their faith is the true faith and that you should follow them. What of course they won’t tell you is that faith is the product of economic circumstances. They won’t say that because they don’t believe it. Religion comes from heaven and not the earth upon which we walk they will say.\nThat may be a hard concept to grasp at first. Well, let us explain it like this. Imagine a world where you had to steal from other groups just to survive. You would be imagining a world that hasn’t really existed for at least 2000 years but has existed in the past. You have just imagined the ‘economic circumstances’ and pretty rotten they are too! Such a world would kill with little mercy. You don’t want many male prisoners but some women and girls would help to build your tribal strength. You would have no concept of rights. It would simply be to kill or be killed, submit and obey. ‘Ownership’ would be by possession. The man, and of course back then warriors were only men, would acquire ownership without a “contract” they took what they wanted and that as we have said included people, so no “rights” either. To our way of seeing things, this is scary stuff. Sparta in Greece was like this in antiquity and other places were too. It was a common phenomenon for early humanity and it was called by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels ‘Barbarism’. It is easy to see why.\nHaving established the economic circumstances, we have will have behaviours that reflect those economic circumstances, such as killing, stealing and owning by violence, punishing with cruelty. To make sure this system worked one would need some ‘morality’. A morality that reflected the harsh material circumstances and justified the brutal behaviour. It would serve two functions it would unite people and also ensure that stealing and fighting were accepted as a way of life under strict conditions. You could not steal from each other for example.\nThere is a line in the film ‘Salmon Fishing in the Yemen’ where they take farmed fish and put them is a tank of water. The water is still and the fish swim everywhere. However, once the water flows the fish swim against the current and once character remarks “ah it is in their nature”. The theologians of faith would like us to believe that their expectations of us are “in our nature” so that we submit to their teaching. Often, they will talk about issues to do with sex and gender, so it looks like things might be ‘in our nature’. But we are not farmed salmon. We, economic determinists, say there is no ‘human nature’ just the beliefs and values that relate to the economics of various periods in history, promoted as still relevant today in the form of religion. You may have ‘spirituality’ but religion is a way of shaping that spirituality to the advantage of an ancient or in the case of modern ‘bourgeois’ Christianity more recent economic elite.\nToday we have morality and laws derived from the values of capitalism to thank for our way of life, bourgeois morality as Karl Marx called it. It is the most modern morality, but even it is it is becoming out of date as our economies in the West take a turn for the worse. With capitalist morality came contract, choice and consent, which in turn gave us our freedom and an 18th-century democracy. It took a while to throw off older pre-capitalist values like gender, faith or racial inequality, but in the end, we did and now our rights reflect our ‘economic’ circumstances, the capitalist inspired free market.\nSo, we can stop worrying then? Well yes and no. The free market like the capitalist system itself needs real value derived from hard productive work to survive but now it is on the life support machine of debt. Our modern ‘bourgeois’ bankers, elite politicians in US or EU etc can see that our ‘economic circumstances’ are weakening by the decade, so they will want to maintain their power whilst controlling us in an impoverished economic situation. A State managed debt dependent ‘free market’ will have to have a new morality and at its core won’t be contract, choice and consent, we will have to behave or else. There are signs this is starting to happen now, and there are religions that can see an opening for a new kind of oppression, handy when our Nation has been bankrupted by our State elites and people are angry. Unless we use our hard-won capitalist values wisely we will undermine the case for them and someone will come along and challenge their legitimacy. Then we will all be in trouble…a sort of pre-seventeenth century trouble too…..nasty.\nNext weeks second (and final) post in this series will look at how we as individuals can use contract, choice and consent in a way that ensures their survival and preserves our freedom. And yes it is determined economically and in a collapsing western economy.",

The Tories and we mean the whole Parliamentary party have no-one to blame but themselves. Rather than have a charismatic male or female leader, the other charismatic males and one female agreed to have Theresa May lead them, thus avoiding a contest for leadership involving another ego driven charismatic. They knew her and rather than have say, Boris Johnson, or Andria Leadsome, they turned a blind eye to Theresa Mays obvious campaign failings and now they are paying the price, and so potentially is the country.\nIt has allowed Jeremy Corbyn to go all virtue signalling and economically illiterate on electors and they have lapped it up. However, the politics of Jeremy Corbyn are half-baked, and in his case half understood, ideas plucked from the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) combined with a desire to survive fractious and sometimes dangerous hard left Islington politics by ‘sort of’ agreeing with every nut job on the left wing, but over a “nice cup of tea”.\nJeremy Corbyn is an ideological lightweight but can ‘work’ a crowd. This is particularly so if the crowd is made up of people with a feeling of entitlement to ‘state’ money. He is a kind of old, grey Arianna Grande of politics. People love to be seen supporting him and he has done the Labour party proud, as you can sense from the amount of ejaculate issuing forth from the now grateful Blairites. However whilst Corbyn may have learnt how to survive Islington politics, when the Borough was (and may still be) home to the headquarters of an array of global militants and ‘people’s armies’, all hell bent on suppressing women, killing Jewish people, blowing people up, his style of politics hides the reality that these people have moved mainstream into the Labour Party. Just look at the threats and trolling!\nJeremy Corbyn’s style of politics hides the reality from people because the pacifist he was and is, would cause him to listen to them ‘non-judgmentally’ and in a spirit of agreement and thus he would not be able to disagree, possibly out of fear. The fact that people like this have moved into the mainstream Labour Party and yet are invisible to the Mumsnet voter who only sees Blairism with a cuddly old fuddy-duddy face promising them money for poor people, is truly frightening.\nCorbyn’s handlers present him as a harmless old geezer with a bunch of Blairites as a party. This is not what the Corbyn Labour party is about. It has a mainstream party membership generally confused about their identity but with a Marxist-Leninist establishment steering the Corbyn bandwagon to victory. It is so desperate for members it doesn’t know who is a member or what they believe.\nLabour Party core values have been disposed of in the Bureaucratic proto Marxist-Leninist hell-hole that is Corbyn’s Labour. “Of course, we will talk to men who beat women and exclude them from local councils, and support gender segregation”. “Yes, of course, we will talk to violent thugs who hate the West and its values, we don’t like capitalism either”! Yes, of course, we will talk to those who would persecute or even kill Gay people or Jewish people, or suppress assertive females, but please please let’s do it over a nice cup of tea”! You could make this stuff up but you don’t need to.",

But what is “culture”?\nThe best description of culture and one which gives an unintended nod to our view that economics underpinning it comes from the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain. We were critical of the Liberal Elite and their stupidity in not really understanding why in modern Britain we have people with a temperament and opinions which cut across the freedom and humanity we have created in the west over the last five hundred years but which we are now quickly undermining.\nIn the Parekh report culture is described as “The habits of mind, the intellectual-reflexes and the professional sensibilities which are historically ingrained and typical of the behaviour of a particular group of people…the unconscious understanding and assumptions concerning politics, social life and justice”.\nThis report seems to understand the right things and offered the hope that there would be a greater understanding of why for example anti Semitism exists in the Labour Party or why certain groups take a biblical view of adultery as a “crime”. However, it didn’t deliver what it promised. The reason seems simple to us. Firstly it has no idea where culture comes from. We at Blue Revolution know culture comes from the economic realities of life all over the planet and at various historical periods. And secondly, the report seems to have enshrined within it a belief that moral relativism and liberal bureaucracy are somehow vectors for change amongst various immigrant communities. We have seen that in too many situations this integration just hasn’t happened.\nThe reasons are simple. Traditional values hark back to an area (Pakistan for example)or an era (7th century Arabia) where rigid values around gender etc helped to preserve society. In the modern free market not only is there no need for rigidity around what is acceptable behaviour for men and women and what is not but the free market itself throws up many moral challenges to people of all faiths and many of no faith.\nThe solution to the problem of lack of integration and tolerance of western values is therefore very simple. Accept that western culture is in many ways appalling and also acknowledge why some people of faith harbour intolerant views about the legitimate behaviour of others……and don’t shy away from the debate!",

The only difference now is that we still have principles underpinning our freedoms which were brought into existence by capitalism, such as choice and consent. We believe in the absence of proper capitalism, these are now under threat.\nA disappointing obsession with making money by “free-marketeers” has undermined the western working class. Exporting jobs to China, for example, or uncontrolled inward migration to do low skill work. It has turned our western working class into first, second and third generation unemployed and once again defined them by fixed social position and their gender as in the days before industry proletarianised them into a class. The term underclass is applied unfairly to these people, victims of a broken system. Only welfare keeps body and soul together but it is heavily gendered with having babies an attractive lifestyle choice thus limiting girls economic opportunities.\nAt the same time as work is going elsewhere, there is migration from areas unfamiliar with capitalism’s principles and thus hostile to gay and women’s rights and with a pre-industrial, irrational propensity to rage. Large groups enter Europe from North Africa and challenge the rights of western working and middle-class people who whilst in employment are being systematically pauperised (but that is an issue for another post).\nIt’s as though the political elite are giving with one hand and undermining with the other. This system of creating and then managing the effects of all this migration and economic change requires massive budget deficits by government and ratcheting debt but its bi-product is that it keeps the ex-workers out of the economy, creates division (note division not violence) on the streets and via gov’t debt allows the whole financial ballyhoo to run for another decade or two. Top jobs and Gov’t contracts funded from taxation with the odd taxpayer-funded bailout in the middle.\nBeing junkies for money and with no “capital” to trade the financial elite have to find a ready source of wealth from somewhere. Where can such sums come from? Well, politicians running bankrupt states and with taxpayers on hand to pick up the bill.\nThe issues that no one is prepared to confront is that the global economy is simply being ‘gamed’ to keep our kleptocrats in a style of living to which they have become accustomed, we don’t matter. The system needs to change!\nSo until it changes our governments will QE, borrow and spend and run ever-increasing budget deficits. All this money slops one way or another into the global economy and makes the financial elite rich, and we all believe it has to be this way.\nThe solution is complex…..but who is prepared to start the conversation.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_a-lesson-in-marxism-for-labour/content_385.html": "A lesson in marxism for Labour\nWhy does the Labour party consider Jeremy Corbyn to be a Marxist whilst at the same time viewing Labour left wing manifesto as progressive? Marx was writing in the 19th century and his ideas were mauled by among others Lenin and Stalin before being discredited and flung into the dustbin of history. Had Marx undertaken a review of the Corbyn/Milne agenda he would have called it “vulgar socialism”, redistributive, based on the idea that society comprises those with money (from whom you extract it) and those in need to whom you give it. Marx didn’t say much about what came after this socialist phase, but he did not see it as the final showpiece for his Communist Manifesto. He saw Communism as the “negation of the negation”, something negating socialism, socialism which has itself negated capitalism. So from our perspective, we believe we have had since the end of World War II a credible form of socialism which has progressed fairness and opened up opportunities to working people, now, however, socialism is turning on the people, with taxation, debt and strained public services. Some public sector workers are treated worse than a 19th-century mill worker whoever is in power. All this is going on whilst the socio-industrial model so beloved of the left pays a fortune to the socio-industrial systems least productive tier the chief executives and senior managers.\nSocialism whether the modern socio-industrial hybrid we see in the NHS and public sector today or the actual industrial model so beloved of Corbyn is actually counter-revolutionary as well as being counter productive.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_america-and-revolution-a-marxist-perspective/content_97.html": "America and revolution? A Marxist perspective.\nWithin Marxism, there is the concept of the ‘contradiction’. A contradiction is a precursor for revolution. They reflect a growing awareness by politically active people that the prevailing economic system does not work and that it needs to be ‘burst asunder’. Bursting a prevailing system asunder ushers in a radical change of direction, usually but not exclusively for the better.\nFeudalism to capitalism was one such revolution arising out of the view of the growing sixteenth-century middle class that aristocracy and being born to status and privilege was an illegitimate way of ordering society. In the seventeenth-century, it was burst asunder and replaced with a system that empowered the middle class, allowing them the freedom to exploit the working class to acquire what became known as capital. Capital is the accumulation of wealth based on profits made by exploiting working people. Basically, exploitation is paying workers a lot less money than they make for the capitalist as profit.\nContradictions, therefore, create a revolution. It does not have to be violent. But change does need to happen, for change not to happen means people are being oppressed and the revolution when it comes will be more explosive than it would have been if the powerful had yielded some ground.\nThe western world is in the grip of a growing awareness by ordinary people that they have high levels of economic uncertainty and low levels of political power. The democracies of the western world were set up in the eighteenth century to protect the interests of the capitalist class. The model, therefore, is top-down. Power comes from the top and not from the base. It would have been considered ridiculous to have empowered working people in the eighteenth century so the systems of government in the west do not allow this. Voting in elections does not really empower people, they are forced to vote for parties that probably do not represent their real values and opinions.\nIn Britain, Brexit was a successful revolution. It happened because of a contradiction, a growing awareness by ordinary people that a remote and an elite, self-regarding bureaucratic superstate could not represent them politically. So, the British people by a narrow margin voted to leave the European Union. This was the last thing the elite in the British parliament wanted, so they oppressed the people with project fear. Brexit was achieved because the Conservative party woke up to the fact that to ignore the Brexit vote would be political suicide. Self-preservation saved both the country and the Conservative Party. Britain, a wealthy but small nation is once again fully independent. Apart from a few naive Blairites Britain has moved on. The fact that Parliament continues to exercise top-down supreme power over the people and potentially over the Government, will, of course, cause problems in the future. This demands a new political settlement that takes democracy onto the next progressive level.\nNow America has a similar political set up to Great Britain. It too is top-down and has two main parties which vie for power. Like the British parliament, it is based on attacking and defending policies. It too delivers election results that may not represent the views of the mass of ordinary workers. Joe Biden has been described as ‘woke’. Woke ideology promotes and politicises identity over and above class or ‘lived reality’, so the clash that created Brexit in the UK will be played out in the US as a clash between a confederation of ordinary workers, to whom, somewhat perversely the billionaire Donald Trump spoke, and the woke intellectuals and public service workers for whom identity is a safer basis for revolution than class.\nTackling the rights of a few preoccupied with their identities not only appeals to the ‘woke’ ego but it does not require much thinking and is avoidant of the real problems in America which are class not identity-based. The problem for America and Americans’ however is unlike the UK the confederation of opponents of the new ‘woke’ political establishment self-identify as an armed militia and militias are sanctioned by the US constitution. The Militias’ in America were sanctioned for two reasons, firstly to mobilise in the event of Britain attempting to re-take their ex-colony in the eighteenth century, and then secondly to clip the wings of an over-powerful federal government. The former risk is now non-existent but with a ‘woke’ president and vice president, the risk of civil disobedience will almost certainly increase.\nTo prevent problems caused by a clash between the working people and the state needs a complicated answer but it is essentially the same argument Blue Revolution propose for the UK, namely reducing the absolute power of the central government and parliament by empowering the people within a legal framework which unlike the current constitution increases the levels of political legitimacy. The issues around poverty and health will alongside increased gun control have the power of the people backing them.\nI do not know whether America will experience civil disorder bordering on civil war but in Marxist terms, the contradictions are clearly there between the mass of working people and their state, moreover, it is the same in every politically mature free-market economy the world over.",

Market distortions like inflated house prices caused by family breakdown, immigration and student indebtedness. Or alternatively, the minimum wage that drives down wages, to a government “minimum.

All different but all united in one belief; its all about them!\nCelebrities, those ubiquitous individuals who before mass communication would have had the status accorded to the manager of the local picture house or the dance hall now straddle the internet peddling themselves as gurus on every subject from politics to health and well being. The interesting thing about “Slebs” or we suppose “performers” of all kinds is that in terms of a Blue Revolution they have carved out a little niche puling in cash from those who can ill afford to waste it. Bankers get hammered but no one looks at the amount of wealth that the poor manufacture and which ends up in the hands of the celebrities who grace the pages of gossip magazines.\nModern Celebrities are numerous and their wealth is grossly disproportionate to their worth. In both economic and social terms the legacy they leave is of little real value but they seem to get wealthy irrespective of this. This process of poor people (via earnings, borrowings and welfare) creating a largely valueless class of “Slebs” is the result of a system that we call “Debtamorphosis”. The mechanism is complex but essentially promoters, commercial TV companies, the internet and newspapers promote these “Slebs” and then advertisers get involved so that a past worthwhile exemplar of good pro social values like a sports personality evolves into a showperson demonstrating personal excess, worth below value and tackiness. The arrogance of these people is what drives their own self promotion and makes them notable and deserving, for them, of more self promotion.\nThe lofty left-wing luvvie may look down their nose at the Katie Price end of the “Sleb” market but the fact that it is Public Broadcasters and Cinema production companies plus glossy magazines managing the promotion process does take the tackiness out of the “debtamorphosis” for them. They are more gilded but non the less still of much lower value than their worth what ever they may think. It doesn’t matter though because being on the telly and rich and famous is all about them; we just pay to keep them there.\nDoctors too have displayed a worrying lack of personal awareness in respect of the wealth they believe they are entitled to. Ideologically the west is sick morally and economically, thus in terms of social justice there seems little case for paying public workers too much tax and gov’t borrowing. Doctors parade around TV studios demonstrating emotions ranging from simple pleading to passive aggression to classic “God complex” narcissism. These well paid and more importantly well respected public employees are making people suffer in pain and putting them at risk of harm in their morally bankrupt campaign to avoid loosing the cachet of earning more money on a Saturday. Again with the Government replacing the Gossip or the Glossy magazine the taxpaying poor and middle earners have to pick up the tab for a profession that hasn’t really done what it says on the tin since the 1970’s. But of course the strike is all about them rather than the tax paying patient; we just pay to keep them in work and happy.\nFinally the underclass. The victims of the “system”. A system that allows fornication on an industrial scale with the all to obvious by product of welfare sired fatherless babies. Sex has become an entitlement that can no longer just be the pleasure enjoyed by people who have embarked on responsible mature and socially valuable course of action; making a public commitment to each other. The multiple fathers with a community “harem” of “baby mothers” are simply a drain on western economies as are the baby mothers them selves. The limited social value delivered by these people is propped up by a drained and depleted economy and of course the lifestyle they enjoy is dependent for its survival on welfare. Welfare of course can’t be made to work against the narcissistic interests of large numbers of this this particular group…….because welfare is after all….. all about them. We just pay to keep them happy and sha****g.\n03.05.16 We are all angry now. Or at least dissatisfied. Why? And what is the solution if it isn’t going to be religious or ideological regression.\nThe public in the western world slides “left” or “right” depending on whether they identify the problems that affect them or make them insecure as being caused by foreigners (right) or bankers and the “system” (left). Outside the west the faith nations become more intransigent about the important role of their faith in civil and political society. These political and religious regressions are caused by a suspicion about the effects of other cultures and ideologies on the community that sees itself under threat; be it the US or Saudi Arabia. Some cultures try to export their “faith” through a combination of persuasion and soft power. Others try through force.\nThe world of “Secular Westernism” is economically indebted and socially insecure and this trickles down to populations who either directly experience the indebtedness and insecurity or are trapped in welfare the new “Opium of the people”. Government borrowing to pay welfare, to protect their populations from the realities of personal debt and insecurity (and to maintain consumption, the modern proxy for an economy) is at best a short term but unaffordable strategy. The system will collapse under the weight of its contradictions; namely the sheer unaffordability of the state taking more and more of the social and economic strain.\nWith “debtamorphosis” the economic winners are only winning at the expense of the indebted masses (all property is debt!) and unfortunately welfare arrangements whilst reinforcing dependence on the state also encourage divorce and other social ills that require a state response. This is unfortunately a phenomenon most marked amongst the less well educated and less economically versatile. Karl Marx would not have recognised “justice” in the welfare system of Britain and much of Europe, he would probably have thought recipients were some kind of under financed aristocracy living idly off the value created by others. He would have been half right. However what keeps public sector workers and the welfare dependent in money isn’t value; as we have said many times, it’s debt!\nIn the non westernised countries the fear of this contagion spreading and undermining society by undermining social norms is getting acute. Women are being systematically repressed to “protect” them and society from secular westernism’s at best amoral influence. It can be seen in the UK and Europe within largely Islamic communities. A return to strict religious norms; gender specific, male in origin and based on submission to God. The fear the western nations have is due to the limit on personal rights that go with this religious conservatism.\nSo peeping over the parapet we have a socially liberal but largely economically and socially bankrupt western world being held together by bureaucracies like the EU and the US federal Government. These organisations are blind as to how to manage the social decay their debt burdened societies have created. However they fear simple “faith based solutions as these curtail liberty and freedom which drives the debt based market economies.\nOn the other hand there are the oil rich Islamic nations together with fundamentalist tribal economies see this western world as promoting vice and social insecurity. Both of course are right. The west is bankrupt and has through retreating from Christian morality allowed its nations to become both free and immoral. The secular left however are right too that tribal and repressive religious regimes are unlikely to deliver freedom and democracy or protect the rights of others in the way secular westernism can.\nSo what is the solution. Well here at a Blue revolution we take the view that the only things that matter are human relationships and these have to be based on Capitalisms legacy a model of “justice” based on Contract, Choice and Consent. Based on the three C’s, relationships between people their governments and the means by which those relationships freely entered into, drive the economy, will preserve rights and promote the production of social and economic value.\nTherefore we say there will be no great technological advances emanating from tribal or feudal Islamic countries any time soon; unless it is a weapon of course. But unless the west stops sponsoring greed and stupidity the legacy of Capitalism in negating the abuses of tribalism and feudalism through the promotion of Contract, Choice and Consent our progress will be wasted.\nWe will leave you to fill in the gaps!!\n07.05.16 Sadiq Khan the most powrful Muslim in the western world. Can he help to build an accord between Islam and the West. We hope so.\nWe had no view about the outcome of the London Mayoral election. Let the people decide! We believe that when presented with the facts the people know best. Unlike the bureaucratic left who see the people as needing visionaries and a vanguard to lead them, we believe the people should be trusted; the problem is we are not trusted enough.\nHowever in respect of the London election we think the choice is cautiously the correct one. Mr Khan seems to be a modern liberal with progressive instincts who identifies himself with a simple faith based culture in the form of Islam. Mr Knan needs to use his power and influence to achieve some radical outcomes for the faith he rightly promotes if nothing else to start its slow reformation.\nHe needs to begin by asking some very basic questions of his western liberal friends and those closer to his faith. For the reader these are the Blue Revolution secular western/Islamic accord questions that not only need to be asked, but also need a progressive answer and solution.\nWhy is it the common perception that Islam is preoccupied with gender stereotyping and hung up about sexuality? How can this be addressed by Mr Khan to make the public perception of Islam less of a rub with secular western liberalism and thus become more progressive as a faith?\nWhy is the common perception that authority in Islam comes from God but via men in authority; either religious leaders or male heads of households? How can Mr Khan offer a more progressive interpretation of authority within Islam that looks modern and less discriminating against women.\nHow can Mr Khan help the secular west to identify its problems as largely due to a diet of debt which props up a consumer culture that promotes “immoral behaviour” whilst hiding the truth of the wests economic weakness and vulnerability?\nMr Khan can use his high profile office and become a visionary for Westio-Islamic cooperation and understanding. Or he will slide into paralysis not knowing which side of the moral divide to safely locate himself. He was elected yesterday. We await with his first 100 days with interest and anticipation and we hope this post helps.\n07.05.16 Debtamorphosis in action. Turning Student debt misery into jobs for the university class of liberal left academics. How ‘just’ is that?\nSomeone on the British television news today was speaking about how EU migrants put money into the British economy by paying their taxes. The assumption was that somewhere there was a pool of actual value from which the nations wage bill is paid. Actual value is national income based on food production, manufacturing and the extractive industries. Exports bring in wealth when the importing countries also have value with which they pay for their imports. The point is these can’t be debt based economies.\nNow this situation doesn’t really exist in the west any more. Migrants like the indigenous population have their wages either paid or subsidised by the government. The government in turn does not have access to real economic value it is forced by the legacy of the post war welfare settlement to make good economic shortcomings by putting the economy into debt. House prise inflation opens up opportunities for homeowners to borrow too. All this borrowing funds consumption and leaves the Government believing that it is in receipt of taxation based on value rather than taxation based on government and individual debt. The recipients of the debt based expenditure become wealthy and this process we call debtamorphosis. Debtamorphosis is the mechanism by which the public sector workers and certain businesses in the service and consumer sector create personal wealth out of other peoples debt. There is no better example of this than student loans.\nFrom the moment the new labour government started to fetishize higher education and expanded the sector beyond what could realistically be afforded by the government, students began to gain first hand experience of the debtamorphosis mechanism. Students borrow thousands of pounds to buy an often pointless degree whilst paying the salaries of lecturers and academics. These academics are recipients of the debt of the students in the same way that those who borrow against their home to pay for popular consumables create retail millionaires. The government doesn’t take the debt directly from the indebted but it skims the debt from the recipients of the debt based wealth in the form of taxation.\nThe phrase we have coined as a corruption of Karl Marx’s “all property is theft” is “all property is debt”. This is the reality of western economies. Having wealth in the economy based on debt and welfare unfortunately leads to social and economic decline. The answer is not more debt but considerably less debt and if this makes the economy appear to shrink, this is as much an illusion as the economies apparent growth. With debt based wealth driving economic growth the economy isn’t really growing it just appears to be so. Are you paying attention George?\n10.05.16 Spies, bankers, politicians and military types all support the EU. Why? Because they are all bureaucrats and it is a bureaucracy.\nThis isn’t going to be a lengthy post; there isn’t much more to say. The world needs less, not more bureaucracy. For countries to grow in understanding and peace relationships between people, communities and nations need to be based on simple principles. We say relationships should be based on Contract Choice and Consent, upon which freedom and democracy will eventually evolve even in the most resistant environments.\nBureaucracy like the EU is an interference with this process of evolutionary human development; but lots of people are well paid to be bureaucrats (the publicsectocracy as we call them) and need to do the bidding of the establishments who pay their wages. So when called upon to enter the fray by say the British Prime Minister or Chancellor they do so willingly, even though they know that what their organisations do will still be done because the public rather than the bureaucracy will demand from them “business as usual”.\n10.05.16 For decades secular westernism was an ideology in search of a personality, Blair, Clinton etc. Now we have Trump, Saunders and Corbyn et al will there be a change of tack.\nOk lets look at this question; it is a little more complex than it first appears. Secular Westernism is the name we at a Blue revolution have given to what has become the prevailing western ideology. It therefore contrasts with other ideologies such as communism and Islamism. Whilst it is an ideology based on some good stuff; freedom, equality, democracy it has, possibly as a result of empowering people who can then make mistakes, gained a reputation for some high value negatives such as economic decline and high levels of social decay, characterised by debt funded consumerism, decline of collective moral behaviour i.e. divorce, illegitimate births, idleness, etc.\nNow it would be stupid to argue that some people don’t do well in a secular western society. Businesses that cater for consumers, banks that offer debt and public sector employees who don’t directly assist people but manage those who do could all be classed as the winners along with those who exist on the froth of the system such as celebrities and personalities, footballers, pop idols and models and those in the media up to and including “top thesps”.\nThe secular western culture evolved in the 1980’s as a response to declining competitiveness amongst mature western economies such as Europe and the US. In the west heavy industry, like ship building was going elsewhere and coal mining was no longer commercially viable in a global market. The response was to look at how the economic paradigm could be re configured to ensure longer term viability of the free market and the continued accumulation of wealth by the few. These people suck the body liquor off the corpse of the western economy; Ad men and those pandering to consumerism for example.\nA reconfiguration was achieved in two ways. Firstly workers within an economy had to shift away from the notion of production as the main economic and wealth creating function and embrace consumption and the public sector as the main economic activities. Secondly to finance the consumption the publics tolerance of debt (both their own and government) had to increase, and student debt is one manifestation of this process. The final element of this process and the one that toxified the whole system was the opening up of the Chinese proletariat to the production of western goods.\nMrs Thatcher is often credited with being the architect on the European side of the pond at least, of this change from production to consumption as the main economic preoccupation. In the US it was good old Ronnie Regan. Both of these leaders had no real grasp of the economic and moral outcomes of this combination of changes. However the short term benefits were apparent to anyone who understood the wealth creating opportunities within the new economic paradigm. Thatcher and Regan were therefore the cheerleaders of the birth of Secular Westernism. They were two people who saw wealth creation for the few rather than value creation for the many as the new purpose of the western economy.\nWere they really blind to the need for real economic growth to come through the production of social and economic value? Who knows….who cares!\nAnyway it was the beginning of the new western paradigm. No longer based on Christian moral values of self discipline, self restraint, hard work, the family and so on and so forth. This new paradigm, debt based and with “freedom” at its empty heart created a number of offspring which continue to protect and finance the paradigm, offspring such as un sustainable stock and house price inflation, a crazy “art” market, zero interest rates, and National Lotteries. In essence we have had the Banking crisis….a secular western phenomenon, social decay, a secular western phenomenon, consumerism, a secular western phenomenon, debt based wealth creating millionaires, a secular western phenomenon, and the hostility from “faith cultures” a secular western phenomenon. Secular westernism whilst having some good bits is not wholesome enough to avoid all these shortcomings.\nTo maintain this model it needed a new cheerleader after the “housewife” Thatcher and her US consort Regan had left office. In the UK at least there was an interregnum with John Major. A decent working class man who understood “real economics” as anyone south of the middle class does. (It is a pity he lets his post war, lower middle class anxieties persuade him of the virtue of the EU…however he is a good man). The John Major phenomenon…Gray…peas on a knife, shirt in underpants provided a simple but effective caricature to the new elite of someone who wasn’t “secular western” or at least not secular western enough. These people were chippy, privately educated wealth and fame hungry elites into who’s fold emerged the cheerleaders of the late 1990’s and 2000’s. In the UK Tony Blair and in the US “shagger” Clintstone.\nOnce these two “great guys” came along the paradigm was crystallised so that in later years Bush and his debt based wars and Brown and his UK banking crisis were mere interruptions to the programme of debt based economic “growth” all at the cost of government financed social and economic decline.\nAfter Blair and Brown we got Cameron and Wizard Osborne of the emerald city of debt. These people are the new “personalities” who the brokers and cheerleaders of Secular Westernism promote. The public instinctively knows the paradigm is broke; even Russell Brand knows it but they don’t know why and therefore don’t have an answer.\nSo to go back to the original question; do we think that the cheerleaders of Secular Westernism need to change tack in the face of growing public disapproval of another Clinton in the U.S. or Osborne as leader of Britain’s Tories The new kids on the block are Corbyn, Trump, Saunders and the toddlers of anti-austerity?\nWe are sorry to say the answer is no there is no need to change tack. The Secular Western paradigm has nothing to worry about, these people are the new “personalities”. Secular westernism has two interconnected but distinct sides; the economic and the social. Whilst the Clintons and Osborn emphasise the advantage of debt in creating “growth” the left and the toddlers of anti austerity emphasise the advantages of debt in solving social problems like unemployment which they believe is caused by “capitalism”, both call it “investment” rather than waste…..which is what it is.\nBoth sides are doing little more than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic of the western economy. We know it and think you should know it too.\n19.05.16 Ideas are easily made toxic when not exposed to challenge. Trade is an effective conduit for challenge.\nNo Narrative exists\n19.05.16 The Queens speech is about prison reform. How will this help in a country of economic and moral confusion.?\nGiving Governor’s more power over their jails seems to be the current big idea for cutting crime. We have some occasional contributors who know a little bit about this subject so we have sought views. The first view seems to be that whilst this will or rather may reduce costs it is unlikely to reduce crime. Maybe the government knows this maybe it is a kind of virtue signalling where the government claims to have lofty ideals but in reality knows that getting Governors to take the financial responsibility for jails means the costs can be forced down. Externalising the responsibility so to speak.\nThe general consensus seems to be that crime is like the sociologists might say “social in character” however it is not really due to “structural inequalities” as they are unlikely also to say. Today the people who commit crime are neither starving or disempowered; to some extent they are the same as too many others who are not involved in crime; welfare dependent, with a wide range of expectations like housing, consuming goods, free health care, and the right to have children at someone else’s expense. And therein lies the problem.\nThe fundamental relationship in society is that between parents and their children has been fractured by moral decline and the essential social responsibility for financing the children ones has, has been undermined by welfare. This scenario sets up the perfect conditions for a life of irresponsibility, and crime is an elemental part of these irresponsible lifestyles. In many if not all faith cultures, including the pre secular West, sexual behaviour is linked to maturity and taking on the responsibility for a wife and children.\nWhilst we may take slight exception to the suggestion that a man takes responsibility for a wife (this is the 21st century after all), the idea that two mature people have children in a fully considered relationship is sensible. They should also accept the constraints of a committed relationship and work together to provide the financial and social stability children need to grow up as stable responsible people.\nWith this kind of stable and loving background children are capable of growing beyond the social and financial level in society achieved by their parents. If this social and financial background is low waged but loving and secure; it should make no difference to social success. The main difference between the middle and upper classes and the rest of society is not education, it is responsible parenting. The prisons how have to extend parenting to people who have come to adulthood not as mature adults but as damaged and malfunctioning childlike men and women. No Governor can correct this long term undermining of an individuals social and economic opportunity, and if they could, it would cost a fortune.\nOur thanks go to Lord John Bird for inspiring some of this content.\n- 5.16 There are bloody revolutions, Red revolutions and Ideological revolutions and now we have a Blue Revolution. But why blue? V4\nSomeone asked one of us recently “why a Blue revolution”. The answer is easy and perhaps we should have shared it before. A Blue revolution is a Blue Collar…. Blue print…. to help save the people of the Blue planet from social and economic catastrophe. It is essentially a moral revolution and blue is the colour of morality too. No guns, no shouting, no politicians, no angst, or vested interest. Just a new perspective.\nWe are concerned with justice in the economic and social sense and see injustice in places that the prevailing orthodoxy sees only justification for the status quo. High salaries for the socially and economically unproductive public sector executive for example.\nSo whilst we see some element of “structuralism” in the problems the world faces, we at a Blue Revolution also recognise that we all have to become active moral agents again, as we were in the past, before technology and welfare freed us in the west from the ball ache of making actual moral choices.\nThanks to morals giving way to this Western ideology (secular westernism we call it) we have become objectified and objectifying consumers; fed a diet of banalities, and rubbish (both food and “stuff”) financed by debt of one sort or another and for too many, a “welfare” which has become devoid of promoting self respect or social responsibility. Fat people on welfare clogging up the British NHS with lifestyle diseases caused by choices only a morally bankrupt nation would encourage.\nWe don’t expect many takers for our revolution……at least not until the prevailing ideology has collapsed under the all too obvious weight of its flaws, fault lines and contradictions, and something else is sought that is not authoritarian or proto Islamic in character. Both are pretenders to the secular West’s throne.\nIn support of our position that the prevailing ideology is clinging on for dear life, we need do no more than to cite the UK governments attempts to get a Remain result in the EU referendum. To us their desperate approach illustrates just how close the EU is to its final death throws. The UK governments position is less of ringing endorsement of the EU and more a rather sad eulogy of its past achievements. Switch off the life support someone please!\n24.05.16 The proposal for a gold backed currency for Africa prompted the destruction of Libya. Hmmm but in a sort of James Bond world it kind of makes sense!\nNo we have no idea either!!\nHowever we doubt even the most idiotic African despot would trust his gold to the good old Libyan Colonel. Western tax havens and London property are much better investments and free of the worry that some North African rival might run off with them.\n31.05.16 The British Conservative Government seems obsessed with “social mobility”; given the privilege of the PM and Chancellor it is perhaps no surprise. However we at a Blue Revolution examine the great social engineering fiasco that is Post War British education. V4\nIt all began as most things have in the UK, just after the Second World war. A nearly broken Britain had, with the determination of every social class up to and including the monarchy, united in common cause, and with the friends of Empire had seen off the fascists or as we prefer to call them techno feudalists, of the Nazi regime.\nUnited in victory the 1945 Socialist Government won a resounding mandate and set about introducing a socialist programme of reform which saw the birth of the state pension, the National Health Service, Nationalisation of the “means of production” and the introduction of a progressive education system which saw the creation of the “tripartite” selection of children at age 11; the eleven plus. The war had shown that the public schools could not turn out enough men of the “right sort” to lead the front line war effort, so use was made of the men from the various British County Grammar schools. These men were in all three services and were often Sergeant Pilots when in the RAF. Whilst they were denied the Officers Mess, they had the technical know how and “non academic skills”to help take the air war to the enemy.\nAfter the war it seemed only fair and just that the old class divides were confined to history and the war effort made the need for this even more urgent. As a result of the introduction of the socialist programme, the Grammar schools delivered academic children into the Universities including Oxbridge. These more academic children began in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s to find their way, as you would expect, into the junior ranks of government and the establishment.\nThe second “arm” of the tripartite model were the technical schools; intended to take the students with an inclination for technical skills into educational pathways that may have led to engineering or chemistry degrees. Finally the rest were offered the “Secondary Modern”. A benign system for those who for various reasons “failed” the other two’s entry criteria.\nWhat quickly happened was the technical schools were viewed as a form of failure, as Britain, steeped in the traditions of the Public School had grown used to “success” and privilege coming via a diet of Latin and the Classics. The three school system became a two school system and this is where we and particularly some of our “old boys” think it gets interesting.\nThe Secondary Moderns achieved the objective of providing a range of post school opportunities which included the full range of jobs at the lower end of the economic scale; factory work, shop work, soldiers below officer rank, and clerks and managers in lower ranks etc. The routes into higher occupations were not closed to these people, but were perhaps achieved at a later date when their financial or academic interests had altered sufficiently.\nThe interesting stuff we believe happened in the Grammar schools however. As has been captured in numerous post war “classic” novels the Grammar schools delivered on their “progressive” agenda and had managed to get working class people into the ranks of Government and the Civil Service, the military, and the city. We could go on but in essence the “establishment” was opened up to people from the lower social ranks. Was this a good or bad thing? Well like all things it depends on your vantage point. If you were offering a top flight education in the Public School (Eton, Harrow, Westminster Greshams etc) it was bad news.\nAn academic child (then described as “bright”) could get to the top without the payment of high school fees and the top fee paying schools were feeling the pinch. The “old” establishment was concerned, and an unscripted conspiracy began to emerge to save them. Grammar schools made “failures” of children at the age of 11, or so it was claimed.\nThe essential point here is that Grammar schools were not being presented as a threat to fee paying schools but as somehow underscoring disadvantage to working and lower middle class children in a way that the fee paying schools had never been identified as having done; at least not overtly. The “old establishment” proposed with the usual connivance of the liberal left, the abolition of them and their replacement with “comprehensives”.\nThe slow re engineering of British class privilege was once again under way following the “Red Revolution” of the post war Labour Government which sought, but failed to stop it. Comprehensives gained additional traction during Britain’s numerous financial crises of the 1970’s; basically they were cheaper than a local authority running two separate schools.\nComprehensive education has gone on to dull social mobility by reverting to the mean. Academies are a good attempt to address decline but they will merely stall it; not reverse it. Averaging out the highs and lows of academic attainment and reverting to an often artificial “standard” simply reflects the average rather than the exceptional.\nWhilst in academic terms there may be some convergence between good comp or Academy and the fee paying sector, the simple truth is that the “non academic” standards are miles apart. Confidence, resilience, stability and emotional maturity are not academic subjects and so are not “taught”. However there is a greater chance of acquiring them in the fee paying sector with parents who have themselves the non academic skills to pas onto their children. Welfare and the decline of the family in “average Britain” has done nothing to promote and everything to undermine social mobility. It is not simply about exam grades.\nSince the 1970’s the social and economic decline in the UK has continued and the education system has, like social work and health, been expected to take over obligations once the normal expectations of good parents; whilst having to deliver academic “results”. In the New Labour years of Smoke and Mirrors, expectations in education were reduced to suggest progress was being made, grade inflation!\nNew Labour’s “investment” in people and “Education, Education Education” was a saddening failure for Britain and the now rejuvenated fee paying schools began to re colonise the silos of power like politics, the Military and the Civil Service and Law as well as making new incursions into well remunerated areas of the cultural environment such as Art and Acting.\nSo bringing things bang up to date, making young people declare their fee paying school “advantage” or “disadvantage” at interviews will not promote social mobility except at the cost of high standards…….sorry but it’s true…We wish it wasn’t but it is. The only way to improve the situation from here on is to repeal the law which prevents academic selection and allow it probably at 13 for some Academies. Alternatively some children to be afforded the privilege of a state supported private education.\nThe other plank of the proposed policy to not stop decline but to reverse it is to concentrate on reversing the sociological factors which undermine the “non academic skills” such as confidence and resilience. This requires a hard and brave look at the rights of parents who too easily have affairs and divorce whilst wrangling over “access” and Parental responsibility.\nThere will always be elites but as long as the elites have some sociological experience of being from a loving secure yet average background the maintenance of class privilege will eventually decline. This is the Blue Revolution …….the red one failed miserably let’s not forget.\nNB It has been pointed out by one wag that the policy to abandon selective education coincided with the Profumo affair. With Stephen Ward the establishment interloper and his bevvy of lower class women bringing too much of the junior NCO culture into the Officers Mess. The upper Classes had always frolicked but there were rules. The messaging was clear then, and in certain professions notably the upper echelons of the legal profession it is clear now, it’s not education that matters it’s class and that’s as much about the “non academic skills” as it is family background. In 1940 the Sergeant pilots and Officers may not have had family uniting them, but they had the same non academic skills. Not unreasonably for many the closer educational achievement and “non academic skills” are related the better. The workers had better start catching up rather than the Government embarking on another “re engineering” catastrophe to bring the privileged down. The Second World war showed it can be done, so lets do it.\n01.06.16 With an eye on social mobility The Government looks seriously at the right issue but does it understand the Cost of Kindness and the Price of Punishment; and more significantly, do we?\nThree hundred years ago and more no one went to prison as a punishment. Prison was where they were held before being punished by flogging or death. Those were brutal times. However the punishments were harsh because there was a need to maintain social order between the classes and the genders, not for no reason was killing ones husband described as petty treason. Punishment has always been about maintaining social order on behalf of the prevailing social and economic elite for example feudalism and male authority. It was all about retribution with a hefty dose of deterrence. It was public and brutal.\nBy the 1950’s in Britain prison itself became the punishment. Loss of liberty. It was also the period when punishment was identified as being about four things. retribution and deterrence were still there but now there was reform and rehabilitation. The psychologists had entered the market for government jobs and were advising that it was possible to retrain people to be “pro social”. An echo of “A Clockwork Orange”.\nThe need to punish was as we have said above to ensure the survival of the prevailing social order. Killing violent husbands could and would not be tolerated and therefore a warning had to go out to all women that to do such a thing would be dealt with publicly and humiliatingly. To not avenge in this way would undermine the elevated status of the male hegemonic structures and undermine social order which still saw control and ownership of resources as being the preserve of the male. As late as the 1930’s a woman would share the gallows with her lover if the lover had killed her husband, whether the woman was involved in the murder or not. The message had to go out !\nWhilst from the vantage point of the modern world it now seems unjust, back in the pre war era the punishment model was coherent and made sense. Retribution and deterrence as a role for prison was a vision shared at every social level\nIn the 1950’s the number of women in the prison system was low and the non criminal but “immoral” behaviours associated with reproductive control and marriage were also low, although growing in frequency. This eventually gave rise to the various divorce and abortion Acts of Parliament which whilst protecting individuals hid social problems rather than dealing with the causes of them. A legacy of which we have to confront today in family breakdown and then family reconfiguring plus single parenthood leading to social disadvantage. Its odd to think that in the Secular West millions of people mainly men are in families with someone elses children\nThe loosening of social bonds which has been going on since the 1950’s causes much anxiety with people demanding punitive action to re establish the social order which to many seems to be undermined as every year passes; yet prisons are full and we are told crime is down. Prison is clearly not achieving its now four stated aims of deterrence, retribution, reform and rehabilitation. We now pay for a punishment system that does little more that warehouse prisoners at massive cost to the taxpayer. Prison no longer deters, punishes, reforms or rehabilitates and all for £2000 per week, per prisoner. So what has gone wrong?\nFirstly we now have a society which is more equal than at any time in the past; and yet…..and yet, we still cling on to old views about past social arrangements and their iniquities. For example women can now, unlike any time before the 1960’s and 1970’s control their fertility. There is little if any shame in divorce and men and women are equal enough so that no longer is the woman dependent financially on the man and the man is no longer socially dependent on the woman for housekeeping, child rearing etc. Each has the capacity to control fertility, manage their lives sociologically and financially and be responsible and informed citizens, Contracting, Choosing and Consenting in their best interests and more significantly in the best interests of society at large. But too many are not doing so and are producing children in ill considered unions with too much fear and uncertainty. Children for whom as adults, life is a reckless game of chance with prison a structured place of safety; a reward rather than a punishment.\nThe welfare model based on “Victorian” social reforming Christian values, does not assume that women have personal control and responsibility, it is still inherent in the system that women are “victims” of male lust and stupidity and so welfare i.e. the tax payer, has to step in and in a “non judgemental” way support the woman who has babies outside of a planned and coherent family structure. The “rutting” male is also off the hook, having no financial responsibility for the offspring he has sired.\nThe whole welfare system is no longer “just” as it is no longer working in the interests of the whole community. Poor single workers are paying taxes to allow the immature, sexually reckless and self indulgent to have babies at the communities expense. There is no Contract, Choice and Consent in the arrangement any more (as there was in the days of marriage); simply a moments drunken passion or a “friend with benefits” arrangement lumbering the community with a baby probably no one really wants. Horrifyingly many end up aborted, but the numbers here also highlight how many must go to term as financial and too often social “wards” of the state. In the rush for sexual excitement the lack of informed choice between “adults” also gives rise to high levels of domestic violence.\nA Blue Revolution is about encouraging and defining a new “hegemony”; one that promotes class and gender equality and responsible choice about lifestyle etc. However the ease with which people give into impulse means that too many of us have not really developed mature adults mind-sets but are living like adults with childlike levels of personal responsibility and entitlement. The prisons are full of “child people”…… Prisoner is the wrong word.\nThe welfare systems role in “gaming” undesirable social outcomes is not in societies long term interests. It would be perfectly coherent to have a massive drop in the indigenous birth rate and then have immigration to top up the birth rate as long as underpinning the arrangement was some kind of coherent “family” unit and the expectation that children were supported lovingly by parents who were in work and not wholly the responsibility of the state and taxpayer. Contract Choice and Consent between people and the community within which they live, is the desired outcome of a Blue Revolution.\nSo what has all this got to do with the price of punishment and the cost of kindness. Well prison is expensive and achieves none of it past and more resent stated outcomes to deter punish etc. Welfare is kind and “non judgemental” but like prison achieves none of its stated outcomes, in the case of welfare to protect the vulnerable and prevent harm. Too many children come into the world as afterthoughts and too many are not afforded a loving home with loving people. There must be a moral revival, a Blue revolution that reflects the social and pharmacological changes that allow women and men to plan parenthood, and an acknowledgement that prison is simply a place to keep the anti social out of the way rather than somewhere that something useful takes place. Rehabilitation is a social function not a penal one!\nThe alternative is a society where prison and welfare create an expensive feedback loop that eventually undermines every bit of positive economic and sociological progress to date.\n06.06.16 The Economics of leaving the EU from the “economic illiterates” of a Blue Revolution……a final perspective…honestly….final! V5\nThe Economics of Remain and Leave are being partially explained but there is too much spin and misinformation on the part of both sides. We try and give a shamelessly un-impartial but we hope more considered perspective.\nFirstly the claim that the British economy will shrink if we leave the EU. The answer to this one is a clear, yes in the short term. If you reduce the number of migrants coming here a number of “inflating” factors will be reduced. Firstly “pressure on public services” will reduce, saving the taxpayer money on health, housing, criminal justice etc. The level of integration between the “government economy” (debt to you and me) and the “real economy” is so enmeshed that when the government spending drops, the economy shrinks. Building up the “real trading economy” will correct any shrinkage caused by the government reducing its immigration related spending.\nEven an armchair economist would see this reduction in spending by government as a good thing in the long term. Government spending is not the “real economy”. There is so much government spending we can’t even locate the “real economy” any more.\nSecondly a major proxy for the “real economy” is house price inflation. Building new houses for “middle class flight” to the “burbs” is apparently good for the economy….well according to Wizard Ozborne. House price inflation means that middle class, middle aged people can spend, spend, spend on consumer goods ….ignoring the needs of their children who are as a result priced out of the housing market. They keep up aggregate demand. House prices also allow builders to make profits that are taxed, and this is generally seen as good for “growth” or good for government spending. The poor old countryside too pays the price here providing green field sites for builders.\nWhat factors under pin house price inflation….well immigration for one thing (in the absence of “real economic growth”). Immigration also feeds the private sector rental market and drives up rents. The upward pressure on rents prices out British workers, but for the wizard Ozborne that is less important than the housing market creating disposable wealth for spending by the “comfortably off”. Cut back on immigration therefore and demand for housing reduces, reduce building and stop concreting over the country side and the economy will “appear” to shrink. Housing might be more affordable for blue collar and younger workers so it can’t be all bad news.\nThird issue, wages. We have a minimum wage. We need this. However it is not enough to buy a house or even rent one. It was introduced by “New Labour” precisely because it knew that with a policy of open boarders the reality of “downward pressure” on wages would have put British workers on the streets and on starvation wages. The tax credit system was an additional measure to protect the British low waged…however no one factored “free movement” into the equasion, a situation which has made the whole system unaffordable. But like house price inflation, the combination of taxpaying British and migrant workers, British workers on “out of work welfare” and British and migrants on “in work benefits” does feed the impression that the “real economy” is growing. Reduce welfare and the economy will “appear” to shrink. But that is like shrinking a debt by spending less; you look poorer but the reality is you are getting your house in order.\nIf we cut levels of migration it will stall the workforces race to the minimum wage and we may find wages rates growing…..cutting taxpayers support to low waged workers and lowering the “tax credit subsidy” big business gets from the taxpayer by government paying workers tax credits.\nFourthly the free movement issue. The remain people confuse…we are sure deliberately…the notion of “free movement of people” with “free movement of labour”. Under the current proposals free movement of people means anyone can come here from the EU with granny and the kids and no one can stop them. The unemployable, offenders, mentally ill can come along with those who are able to take a useful place in the labour market. We don’t really need more of the EU’s needy and vulnerable or dangerous. Taking away all welfare will return us easily to “free movement of labour”; we can’t imagine anyone will object to this, even the EU. All the British young who fear loss of opportunity to travel will still be able to travel to Europe to work. In a real Marxian sense not all people are “factors of production”; only workers require free movement in this free market closed bordered quasi socialist republic of the EU. Nobody needs the free movement of people\nFifthly the productivity of Britain is not going up, it is stagnant. The reason in economic terms is that cheap labour means there is no incentive for business to invest in technology to boost productivity. The minimum wage prolongs this process and low skill migration means we are unlikely to see productivity increase significantly over time. Minimum wage labour and migration stalls any increase in productivity and therefore undermines long term growth and prosperity.\nFinally a comment on Cameron’s claim we are leaving the single market if we leave the EU. This is totally spurious. We must not swallow the line by the Remain people who are claiming that Britain leaving will EU will result in the EU abandoning all interest in its original objective; peace through trade, including trade with the UK. The idea that we would be abusively cut out of the “free trade area” like an abused and rejected spouse is utter rubbish. We at a Blue revolution believe we may have to suck up some limited “free movement of workers” as described above, but the idea we will be frozen out of the “single market” is ridiculous.\nThe EU was and is about economics, trade and peace. Trading to build a common understanding and a common market. Unfortunately the EU sprouted a Commission, a Parliament and a Court; all in our view unnecessary. The EU needs Britain to become a beacon of world trade beyond Europe, to encourage global peace through global trade, particularly with English speaking African nations. The EU will not destroy the next British “Industrial and social Revolution”, but even with Brexit we will, we believe, have to compromise a little but at least with Brexit it will be a fair and open negotiation rather than an EU instruction.\nIt must be remembered that Britain has opted out of any further consolidation of the EU as a single political union. Free movement of people reflects the desire to achieve unitary political status. Free movement of workers reflects the desire to be part of a single market.\n08.06.16 We have been asked; if the expensive Criminal Justice System doesn’t deliver punishment, deterrence, reform or rehabilitation what do we think should be done? V2\nIn our previous post on this complex subject we suggested that the Criminal Justice System was no longer delivering any of the objectives it has been expected to deliver over the last thousand years. Yet it remains an expensive part of governments expenditure; expenditure which the government spends on behalf of the people. Western criminal justice and welfare are good examples of how secular westernism is undermining its crowning achievements of freedom, democracy, equality and human rights.\nThe tabloid press engage in moral outrage and indignation, demanding more and more prison for any number of crimes. Some of this is of course justified. Yet is there really any justice when the imprisonment for example provides a better life for young men than the amoral chaotic and emotionally turbulent and uncertain life outside the prison walls. We thought it was time we looked at this subject from the perspective of a Blue Revolution. Thank you to those who prompted us to do so because crime is a scourge on society and seems to us to affect most acutely the very people the government and society must protect, namely those who have less protection derived from their income, status and occupation and most importantly their location.\nIn our more philosophical post on the subject of prison and welfare we looked at the price of punishment and the cost of kindness and concluded that a combination of generous welfare and prisons that offered little in the way of reform were expensive and morally ambiguous. This gave rise to a confusing situation which had the capacity to generate a feedback loop of more people entering both systems and staying there alternating between the two. The victims of crime the very people who should expect the states protection, the vulnerable young and elderly from the very same poor and morally ambiguous communities.\nNow some, depending on ones “ideological perspective” might feel a sense of outrage at the term “morally ambiguous communities”. Isn’t this reinforcing prejudice against the poor? Well yes and no. As economic determinists we would argue that there is nothing particularly “moral” about a lot of what has “evolved” (devolved might be a better word!) in the last seventy years or so in the west. Dependence on welfare, a belief that children are a way of accessing welfare, fatherless children in stressed or psychologically damaged “families” with parents who’s coping mechanism isn’t to work hard together and provide to rise out of the ghetto but to “psychologically disassociate”. This leads too often to adults and young people seeking comfort in drugs, drink or promiscuous sexual activity this is morally ambiguous. The urge for society to be kind, conflicting with the urge to condemn. Moral ambiguity!\nIn general for too many men crime is the surrogate economy (just as welfare babies are in general a surrogate economy for too many women) and too many of these men become either neighbourhood “feudal Barons” or community “tribal warlords” with all that such systems inflict on those caught up in them. Extreme violence being only part of it. The broad aspiration to succeed only finding expression in how much you can trade in drugs, stolen goods, women, guns etc. Within our communities in the west this is too frequent a scenario. Prison for the leaders is a disruption, for the low ranks…the crime proletariat shall we say, prison is a break.\nSo from the economic determinists of A Blue Revolution some thoughts on how we might reform this expensive self defeating yet self promoting system. If you are wedded to a belief that the state is wholly responsible for the lot of the individual….you are a socialist…. you might wish to look away.\nFirstly no society that has ever thrived, spends more on those trying to undermine it’s values than t does on those upholding them. So we have a prison system that costs per prisoner more than the fees of Eaton to achieve nothing. That needs to stop.\nSecondly child birth is not and should not be “morally ambiguous”. No society that wants to survive can have people running around fathering children with women (girls too!) giving birth to welfare babies. Children should be societies investment in the future but too many end up being societies liability.\nNow in simple societies such children would be killed at birth or as adults killed for crimes social or moral. We do not advocate that. Such barbarism has no place in the 21st century. We also accept that there will always be cases of welfare children deliberately born to access benefits even if such behaviour was proscribed. Understanding of the motivation, be it anti social or borne of loneliness, rather than outright condemnation should be shown in such cases. However men and women have the power to control fertility so there needs to be a limit to societies empathy\nSo how then can we “re engineer” the “system” to stop these problems evolving in the first place and to make the system cost effective and morally coherent in the future.\nA recent case in the US of a male who received a six month sentence for sexual assault illustrates the point quite nicely for us. Here we have behaviour by this male which was simply disgusting. The world will know the details. He received a six month prison sentence because he was well connected and a successful athlete. Again moral ambiguity exists on both sides of the argument. The female has been viewed by some as contributory and therefore the male has had his culpability mitigated so his character and background serve to reduce perceptions of his risk. Understandably feminists and others want the judge who leniently sentenced him sacked .\nThere is talk of “cultural sexism” at work and it still being rife in the west. To the feminists we say “cultural sexism” is rife everywhere; from its most extreme in Saudi Arabia where being a woman is almost a crime to the US and Britain where sex is too often seen simply another “product” men can buy from women. Some men fail to read the signals properly or simply don’t care; they just consume a woman like they consume a can of beer.\nThis is a woeful reflection of the morally impoverished state of the modern human condition; reverting in too many instances to man re establishing his primitive dominion over women, either with cash or simply taking advantage of a woman’s vulnerability or availability. Pornography, promiscuity, adultery, illegitimacy are not things to be cruelly condemned with violence, this isn’t the seventh century, but they reflect in too many ways this primitive domination by men of women or in fewer cases in the modern west women’s cruelty towards men….sorry but we did suggest some of you may wish to look away. But what can be done to engineer a moral revival?\nFirstly prison and justice. The public want protection rather than retribution…only tabloids talk of retribution in the form of long prison sentences because they, like socialists, don’t recognise that it is the public who pay for it. You can’t be protected from people who have never offended so you have to use a conviction as a marker for potential future harm. A prison sentence should then be deployed that reflects the harm caused and the potential for harm in the event of the offence happened again. As the psychologists say “the best way of predicting future behaviour…is to look at past behaviour”.\nSo our American sexual abuser should not have been sentenced on who he was, but on what he did. Two to five years might have been more in line with his risk. However this is the bit that makes our view controversial….he may be able to persuade the professionals who manage is risk during his two to five years that he is safe to be in the community and so with some liaison with the victim and some safeguards being put in place he could be released after six months. Unlikely but in our view theoretically possible.\nSafeguards could include tracking, tagging, loss of licence to drive, passport or residence in a certain place, with parents say, plus supervision. This does not breach “human rights” as he would ordinarily be in prison. This brings the cost of punishment down whilst ensuring the victim and as importantly the public is protected. The cost of most of this shifts to the individual and the family of the offender and not as is wholly counter to social “evolution”; the public.\nOther advantages are that there could be expectations that the offender secures work or accommodation, undertakes treatment etc. if they fail to do so they are already on a prison sentence so they simply get put back in prison.\nNext welfare solutions. Welfare needs to be tapered so that you can only have one child at the governments expense, this is called structuring expectations. There should be no expectation that the government pays for any more. The grown ups amongst you will also realise that “the government” is simply a proxy for the people and the moral ambiguity we spoke of comes as a result of the government taking a different view of things from the people and trying to impose it on them, like expensive welfare and prison.\nPeople do not want to see children born to parents who can offer no long term economic or social support and who are destined to produce children who become the communities liabilities rather than social or economic assets in the form of good citizens or workers. We also need to ensure that we address the sexualising of society. Women (and some men) are not objects for consumption but it doesn’t help when society encourages them to see themselves precisely like that.\nThere are previous posts covering some of these complex issues. We could go on but this is a starter for ten.\n14.06.16 The “Publicsectocracy” one sizable obstacle to “the Blue Revolution”. A class at peace but only with itself! V1\n“Chumocracy” or Quango-ocracy the world is beginning to understand that there is a class of people in the west who have established themselves in positions of power and influence and no different from the feudal overlords of the past they have done this at the expense of the public. In many respects these people be they Health Chief Executives or Executive Head teachers, Judges, Generals or EU technocrats expect to receive salaries in excess of £100,000 per annum but in return they add very little discernible value to the society or community they serve. The reason being they are “figureheads” rather than operational staff such as actual health care professionals, soldiers, or teachers. We at a Blue Revolution want to explore the rise and rise of the “publicsectocracy” and why we need to review their existence, particularly as we move hopefully towards “Brexit”.\nThese “publicsectorcrats” are very expensive to maintain as a class of people. The numbers are significant and with on costs and pensions they take a sizeable sum of money out of the public purse. A purse that has to borrow at huge expense to the poor and young to pay for them. As economic determinists we understand the rise of the publicsectocracy. But also recognise that unlike capitalist who in the past appropriated “value” from workers ……having a right to some but not all of the value they appropriated; the publicsectorcrat has little if any legitimate right to the wealth they consume.\nThey like most modern sociological phenomenon the “Publicsectocracy” have their origin in an era long since past. In the feudal system the king identified himself has having a divine right to take whatever wealth he could acquire from those who created it. The aristocracy were there to ensure that the flow of wealth moved from the bottom to the top of society. The peasants toiled for little if any reward and were “bonded” or enslaved to their overlord. This is a system that was negated by the emergence of capitalism which was more overt in the way the process worked because there was no obvious legitimising ideology to support the appropriation of value by capitalists other than they owned and controlled the factors of production, which included “labour”. Karl Marx claimed that religion was the “Opium of the people” however it did not legitimise anyone being at the bottom of society in the way perhaps Catholicism and Feudalism worked together to make society rigid and un-dynamic and justify the status quo.\nWhilst the poor under capitalism could not enjoy “Contract, Choice and Consent” the concepts applied to them as much as to the rich. This is why the feudal system ended; it declined in power as society matured within the liberating framework of law based on Contract, Choice and Consent. Or as we at a Blue Revolution know them the three C’s\nWe have said this before but as society evolves we must hang on to this Capitalist legacy of Contract, Choice and Consent as it is the one element of the past that in a dialectical way must be preserved in the future. It protects vulnerable groups from abuse and this includes women, gays, differently gendered as well as faith groups and minorities. There is no substitute for the freedom afforded by the three C’s.\nHowever as society progressed through Capitalism getting richer and richer and spreading the wealth generating capacity of Capitalism around the world, its flaws and contradictions became more and more exposed; notably how the poor could not take advantage of the three C’s poverty precluded it.\nSo to overcome these contradictions governments stepped in to extend the practical ability of the poor to benefit from the fruits of Capitalisms freedoms. At its most extreme in Western Europe was Britain’s post war Labour government. To mount this “just” war on what became Capitalisms tendency to behave like a feudal system (calcifying wealth into the hands of a declining number of capitalists and excluding workers from the freedoms accorded to them by the three C’s) governments needed an army of bureaucrats who would manage the process of engineering social change.\nThese people “the public sector” were initially the recipients of payment drawn from the value produced by the capitalist system, but as now, soon came to see themselves as an essential part of a system that needed to be preserved whatever the cost. As western society became more and more dependent upon debt and Capitalism lost its value generating edge, so debt supported the publicsectocracy…by now like the feudal overlord and the uber capitalist who, rather than creating actual social and economic value simply turn personal and public debt into personal wealth; both are part of an intractable system that cries out for reform.\nBoth the secular western market system and the Publicsectocracy are wrongly seen as essential to the future well being of society and must be preserved at all costs. However both keep society enslaved just as surely but less “legitimately” than the economic eras that preceded them. We will leave it to you to work out why….but the incompetence of the EU goes some way to explaining our point.”\n20.06.16 British MP gunned down by a “crazy”. The solution; more respect in politics. Is this the real cause and the only solution?\nIn the eighteenth century one MP was told….”Sir you will either die on the end of a rope or die of the pox”. His reply; “That Sir depends upon whether I embrace your principles………..Or your mistress”. Politics has never been a nice business and was probably a lot nastier in the past than it is now. We at a Blue Revolution think something is wrong but we are not sure it is “politeness” or indeed respect.\nTo the economic determinists at a Blue Revolution the explanation might be a little more complicated and a little less easy for the “political and analytical” classes to accept.\nMore later…\n22.06.16 Final Plea to the British progressive “intellectual left”; vote Brexit tomorrow!\nWe have tried to explain the reasons why the EU is an unnecessary bureaucratic waste of a continents resources and we hope we have made our point. But if not some final comments. The EU is essentially a twentieth century solution (bureaucratic socialism) to a nineteenth/twentieth century problem (continental scale war and Capitalisms failure to re distribute wealth “fairly”).\nIt has however through trading only within its boarders effectively locked out the rest of the world from this peace through trade redistributive process and indeed has fostered war beyond its comfortable boarders whilst also fermenting tensions within them as it’s “mission creep” sought to create a superstate where one was not needed. Wanted is not the same as needed!\nBy allowing free movement of people as opposed to workers, its technocrats have allowed people unfamiliar with the democratic impulse (borne of work and enterprise) to wander free within its boarders and without the psychological conditions necessary to understand “freedom”; we call these conditions a belief in Contract Choice and Consent, these people now ghettoised on the continent threaten the very foundation of the free, democratic, life affirming system that protects all lifestyles we accept in the west.\nThe EU needs reform……it will never reform as it is not in its interests to do so. If you believe in people’s right to be free, self determining down to the level of the individual, you have a moral obligation to vote “Leave” on the 23rd.\nWe will explore this more after tomorrow when we will know the outcome of “independence day”.\n24.06.16 Well done to Britain; a more mature reationship with the EU beckons and bonus, we re enter the world.\nThere is nothing to fear from the result today. It is the best thing to happen to Europe since the the end of the Second World War. Europe needs to be liberated from the centralised control of the EU. The EU has become a post war model of bureaucratic socialism the intention to centrally “force” trade on an all too often warring Europe. The fact the “remainers” couldn’t sell the EU to the British public shows better than anything else its limited value.\nWar is no longer a risk within Europe due to trade peace and understanding. With Brexit the EU needs to recognise that the role of the old EEC achieved along with NATO a long term and now sustainable peace in Europe through trade. The EU was undoing that work going beyond trade and turning peace through trade into a Franco-German vanity project; the political bureaucratic and expansionist EU.\nThe British government will now consider the future and how to forge a mature relationship with hopefully a mature EU. This must retain free movement of labour within the EU and abandon the lunacy of free movement of people (no welfare for “workers” unless they become British). Secondly we will need to try to negotiate to retain a seat on the European Council and we should pay for the privilege. This is where we had some limited influence. Finally we leave the European Parliament and cease to be subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It sounds simple but essentially ignoring the technical details that is “job done”.\nWe need a relationship that reflects the old EEC ambitions this is what Britain instinctively wants. They instinctively don’t want to be paying for an EU public sector elite of high powered (and highly paid) Bureaucrats who line their own pockets whist undermining trade, profitability, and diversity with their silly Parliament and Court.\n25.06.16 In the wake of Brexit do Britain’s “Blair” generation need the psychiatrists couch? We consider the country’s youth and their collective mental health V3\nHere at a Blue Revolution we were not at all surprised that Brexit succeeded and indeed some of us considered the win only marginal rather than outstanding. It was the blue collar vote, invisible to the pollsters, that won it. People tired of seeing their wages pushed to the state minimum by waves of immigration.\nBrexit’s win foreshadows a new period of exciting opportunity for Britain as it re enters the global economy on its own terms having parked itself for too long in the malfunctioning EU. An EU of debt laden mature but declining states propping each other up whilst promoting policies which effectively undermine the ability of a nation state, any nation state, to prosper.\nHow did the EU get away with this and how close did we come to being locked into this failing arrangement. To make the EU legitimate the psychology of the individual nation state had to be “engineered” so that the aims of the EU have to become the aims of the individual within the nation state. Blair was the man who set out to promote this agenda, the discredited “diversity” agenda, with his personal narcissistic goal of becoming the EU president. In Britain like much of the EU the project was frighteningly successful.\nSo whilst the rest of Europe works out what it means for them now Britain has voted out; what do the young British Blair generation themselves make of the decision. They were clearly the foot soldiers of the Remain project. Firstly there must be some anxiety as young Britain has had to endure two kinds of psychological abuse. The abuse of the passive aggressive partner claiming as so many do “you are nothing without me”….”If it weren’t for me you would have no friends/money/ status on the world stage”, or “I’ll kill myself if you leave”.\nIf this wasn’t bad enough; and those who have been with a “Bunny Boiler” will recognise the scenario’s above; Britain also went in for some traditional self harm; Armageddon, World War three and “punishment budgets” and economic impending post Brexit crisis.\nAt the personal level this has left too many young people baffled, angry and confused. The young as always seem to be the most badly affected. This “Blair” generation of young entitled people have been raised in a moral kindergarten to expect “consumption” as the high point of their existence and “Brexit” has been presented as a threat to personal consumption. Not only that, it has been identified with restrictions on travel and opportunity to work abroad.\nThe reality of course is that there will be more not less travel as Britain re configures its international trade with an approach that opens up the whole world to opportunities to travel and not limit it to the mono cultural and racially homogenous EU. The Blair generation with their “iffy” GCSE’s in geography really don’t understand the difference between a continental land mass made up of nation states and a vain bureaucracy complete with bogus parliament and court of justice plus assorted “experts”. In confusing a passive aggressive bureaucracy with a continent of nations, young people fail to see the real limits to international travel and trade imposed by protectionism within the EU “family” with its enmeshed and unhealthy interdependence.\nThanks to a diet of pious “diversity” this inability to see the reality of what is going on is a kind of cognitive dissonance and causes the young to misunderstand the world around them and misread their role within that world. They get petulant and start to shout ill informed slogans like “don’t take me out of Europe” “Not in my name” or they view the bureaucratic socialism of the EU as “progressive”. Other manifestations are the habit of “no platforming” speakers with generally traditional appetites for debate whilst happily segregating themselves along gender lines whilst listening in awe to a load of twenty first century theological hogwash dished up as “cultural diversity”.\nWe at a Blue Revolution take the view that this referendum had to happen when it did and no later than 2018, so full thanks should go to Dave Cameron for his courage in holding it. If it hadn’t happened when it did by 2018 the people who by dint of their age predate the “Blairification” of the masses would be insufficient in number to swing the referendum to Brexit.\nThe young now have an opportunity thanks to Brexit to get excited about trade deals with the countries of six habitable continents as oppose to just one and to look forward to seeing the whole world as it really is in all its awesome wonder, full of potential trade and travel opportunity and yes dangerousness. By overcoming the dissonance caused by the “Blairification” of public education, they will be able to avoid seeing the world from the perspective of a risk averse, manipulative and self regarding European elite, who to a majority of the British voter have been shown up to be “Kings with no clothes”. Sorry guys but the project is over, your game is up…..at least in the UK.\n28.06.16 Blinking into a new dawn; have the Brexiteer’s lost their direction? V2\nThe sky hasn’t fallen in and hopefully now that we have sent a seismic shockwave through the EU world war three might be staved off for a century or so. The stock market has done what it will always do when confronted with a bit of “uncertainty” to undermine “confidence” it has swung around a bit as of course has the pound. However the reality is much of this was within normal parameters and whilst the seismic shock may have upset the EU grandees it has done little to derail the markets; which tells us all a lot. However what does Brexit actually mean and how can the UK help the EU smooth its exit.\nFirstly there is a need for a theoretical model to offer some strategic guidance and shape the form of the debate. We at a Blue Revolution offer some suggestions based on a our sound theoretical model of Economic Determinism informed by a free market consumerist economy, which we want to see change.\nWithout a doubt trade must continue; this is the EU’s reason to be it is what the EU has contributed to bringing peace in Europe (along with NATO as the military wing of the EU). The main concession is around workers movement, which will be barely understood by the workers of Britain. British workers however need to understand that free movement of workers is not the same as free movement of people.\nWith free movement of people you don’t actually need a job to come to the UK. But if you come to the UK you can bring the kids and the partner, you can even bring mum and dad to look after the kids whilst the worker is at work. All of this is subsidised by the “in work” benefit system. Unemployment with kids is also problematic and gives access to “out of work” benefits. So workers should not be incentivised to bring them unless their wages are high enough to pay for them.\nTherefore workers as a factor of production can and should be able to travel freely, people (including the ill and lame), kids and the elderly who are not factors of production, can’t. Really that old EEC principle needs to be enshrined in EU law as France or Poland might start to question this “principle”. It is lunacy to promote free movement of people.\nSecondly some of the institutions of the EU have some merit….but some not much. The Council of Europe is a must. We cannot walk away from this institution and must pay to stay. It will put us at the table for important discussions about security, crime, economics, trade. The Council of Europe is an important institution and like the Commonwealth brings consenting nation’s together.\nSecondly, and this makes some of our “revolutionaries” feel a little queasy, the EU Commission probably needs some UK funding and some “Commissioners” or representatives from the UK. EU trade and industrial standards are needed by the UK to compete with the EU and its member states. This will need paying for. It would be wrong to avoid influence here.\nHowever the EU Parliament and its army of millionaire MEP’s should not be something the UK pays for; We believe it is an institution which adds little value to Europe and along with the Parliament can go those Commissioners who the UK feels are irrelevant to its long term economic prospects. No longer subject to EU law the European Court of Justice is unnecessary for Britain too.\nWith free movement of workers and no welfare accelerating the free movement of people and with no silly EU elections to the European “Parliament” the obvious manifestations and irritations of the EU will have gone. There may be a price to pay to get the best deal; it may be we have to pay 15% of the EU budget for a few years, until we get VFM and pay for what we get and they sort out their efficiencies. However we will need to accept that we can’t stop paying straight away……but in 10 years time it will all be “history”.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_how-moral-is-the-free-market-when-you-are-an-economic-determinist/content_269.html": "How moral is the “free market” when you are apply principles of material determinism?\nWe have tended to spend a lot of time thinking about the left, in particular, their denial of the origins of our rights in the capitalist system and their failure to grasp the importance of “surplus value” as opposed to debt in any kind of “just” society. However, their critique of the “free market” whilst well intended, has clearly failed to “hit the right spot” at least as far as we are concerned. How so?\nAlmost total economic reliance on the free market and the financial sector arose in the 1980’s, promoted by neocons like Blair and Clinton. They advanced a range of policies intended to stimulate consumption and therefore create economic growth.\nThe Western free market became more and more debt-dependent. What beguiles us is that whilst the free market has a lot of capitalisms DNA primarily values of contract, choice and consent which underpin our precious freedoms and liberty, it creates only fictitious wealth. Unlike real “surplus value” generated by capitalism, the free market relies on global labour market differentials and the financial engineering of debt to make a small elite very rich. It also keeps too many people in the West very poor.\nIt took us at BlueRevolution a while to “click” that the phrase used in the 1980’s to describe post-industrial economics, “a greater role for financial services” basically involved governments and people getting into more and more debt to pay for their and their nation’s consumption. Much of what is being consumed however is made on the far side of the planet so the act of “production” is removed from what should be an economic synthesis of production and consumption. A balancing act of land, labour and capital generating value to be acquired either by capitalists, workers or the State.\nWhat does this mean for morality? Well, it would lead us to conclude that a number of social difficulties arise from this new “free market” model. Firstly to maintain consumption but without production, the economy has to have money fed into it. This is where debt comes in. Italy has debt equal to 135% of GDP. The UK is less but only because of the willingness of its working people to get into debt themselves.\nBecause we are economic determinists we believe our lifestyles and our morality will become shaped by our material circumstances which are basically indebtedness. One obvious consequence is that we can consume more than is sustainable for the planet to produce, as we can defer payment until a tomorrow that never arrives. Global warming may or may not be man-made but pollution certainly is!\nAfter massive overproduction, the next most significant consequences of the free market model is that wage levels are fixed globally so work goes to the cheapest labour. The mix of land, labour and capital happens in China or Vietnam or elsewhere. This has resulted in a new class developing, not of revolutionary organised proletarians ready to seize control of the “capital” they produce, but a sad welfare and “healthcare” dependent class. This “class” is reliant not on worker produced capital or wages, but government debt for their miserable survival. For this group of second and third generation, ex-industrial workers (millions across US, EU and UK) choices in life are determined not by personal economic realities but welfare entitlements. The big pharma industries are always on hand to stimulate or lobotomise as required.\nThis is the constituency that is simply awaiting an ideology that makes sense to their hopeless existence and that could be Islamism or ideas from the far right. Certainly, in continental Europe the “free market” is both attracting migrants and then inflicting on them a living hell of welfare and idleness so they are at risk of becoming radicalised in ghettos.\nThe “liberal left” pretend to understand immigration, however, immigration needs a functioning economic system to proletarianise newly arrived people and turn them into workers with modern tolerant liberal values.\nThese values are based on capitalisms principles of contract choice and consent. The free market too often fails to find an economic role for these migrants. In the West promoting these values within an inclusive economy that demands their application as opposed to mere appreciation is how we should preserve our rights and freedoms and inculcate them into those for whom such principles seem alien. Particularly when women’s rights are considered.\nFinally, after debt funded overproduction and its contribution to planetary destruction as well as the inability to engage all in society in meaningful economic activity, we have the morality of we consumers ourselves.\nAn economic choice is an important principle, who you work for and for how much is the way we identify worker from slave or surf. However today we have too many consumer choices which with their basis in debt aren’t realistic choices at all. Moreover, too much choice which comes too easily breeds a sense of entitlement that is dangerous when governments try to reign in public spending and thus limit choice. Our binary political system fails because consumers with a vote tend to want more not less hence spiralling national debt. Political parties are no longer able to represent the nation responsibly. People in politics and less party is required.\nAs the western free market lacks mass collective production people identify themselves as consumers and individuals, sort of unique units of consumption. This we believe explains the death of the “class system” in the Uk. As production is no longer a collective activity but a best an individual one individuals market just about anything they can. This is the West’s Achilles heel. For in the West we can now find a provider for just about any form of behaviour or product we might want to experience. “Industries” are created such as the pornography industry which takes a private non-commercial activity and sells it as a product to be consumed. Eventually, this goes mainstream and erodes our sense of interpersonal morality. It affects how we relate to each other too, we are consumed or the consumer of each other. Divorce perhaps reflects this sad reality.\nSome “of faith” view this development as symptomatic of an increasing moral sickness and a sense emerges that our freedoms are to blame. The free market separates our behaviour from any sense of it being wrong, as long as what is produced and consumed has a price within the economy. A lot of groups and ideologies find this is justification enough to try and change our freedom loving way of life.\nSo, in conclusion, we have a free market loosely based on the values of capitalism but without capitalisms discipline and capacity to combine land, labour and capital to create value. The free market produces vast amounts of stuff for people to consume gobbling up resources and polluting the planet. People get rich within this model whilst others see their jobs go abroad and in the worst cases end up existing on welfare and drugged up in healthcare. The debt dependent workers pay for it!\nWe need to re-engineer our politics to reflect these economic realities making it more democratic and inclusive, to liberate people from what is becoming an increasingly dangerous and planet destroying economic political and social model.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_material-determinism-promoting-moral-behaviour-in-a-free-society/content_299.html": "Material determinism-promoting moral behaviour in a free society\nOne of the problems of the modern world is that there is too much emphasis on each of us getting our own way; having what we want; being stimulated for a short time with for example drink, drugs or sex. Such personal preoccupations and obsessions can and do lead to cruelty because we sometimes find we get less than we think we deserve and we can behave cruelly and get away with it because cruelty can be and often is under the radar of the law and decades ago we mothballed our collective moral radar in the drive for inclusivity, making previously immoral behaviours, acceptable. This in itself was a good thing but to hold us together as a society we need some moral principles to avoid social incoherence and a plethora of competing moralities. We will examine how economic determinism can provide a legitimate moral framework that can apply evenhandedly around the planet. To bring life to our ideas we will focus on what we believe to be the Western words seven deadly sins. We begin with cruelty.\nThe sort of cruelty seen most often but not exclusively is within families or other close-knit groups. Cruelty has to have an element of viciousness or vindictiveness about it as the perpetrators aim is to cause hurt to another as a response to their own error of judgement in getting into a situation they no longer value respect or like.\nWe rush into ill-considered relationships driven by our urge to enjoy the stimulation and dream-like effects of sexual activity. We don’t stop ourselves from this headlong rush to get “intimate” and indeed there are people who see little harm in promiscuity and “pop up relationships” like you can dial up on Tinder or Grindr.\nHowever the prevalence of promiscuity reflects two fundamental issues closely linked to cruelty; the extent to which people throw away something which should be special; the company of a partner and friend whom they wish to love and cherish, and from whom they should expect the same; and the lack of any consideration about whether any new relationship has long-term social or economic value. This is where materialism comes in. It is always necessary to consider the wider economic implications of especially a free choice.\nBy the time people realise their mistake there may be children and responsibility plus the boredom of a relationship that has “intimacy” but one neither respects or loves. This is the environment within which cruelty breeds.\nIt is manifest in a number of acts some easily understood such as adultery, all the way down to causing someone to worry (staying out later than agreed and not returning concerned calls), words of indifference “oh do what you want”, words of irritation “oh go away” to words designed to cause harm “you are stupid/ugly/useless”. These casual acts of cruelty harm the recipients emotionally and ultimately are a sign that the perpetrator and victim have made poor life choices. Often the perpetrator is unprepared to take responsibility for their behaviour. Grinding low-level cruelty causes depression and suicide drug and alcohol misuse.\nThe proliferation of pornographic material is to meet the needs of men and women trapped into unsatisfactory relationships yet preoccupied with sex. Its overt use can be an act of cruelty itself. Its existence reflects a market driven by short-term socially and economically shallow obsessions with the here and now.\nAt its most extreme cruelty is domestic violence and child abuse, seen in all too many households. This is the reason that in the western world cruelty is one of the most prevalent of our modern seven deadly sins.\nTo avoid committing this common modern sin we need to return to a way of life that requires us to consider relationships carefully and avoid getting trapped into situations where cruelty is used as a means of feeling better about ourselves as we cope within a self-inflicted dire situation.With freedom comes personal responsibility, you can blame no one else.\nThe Western world has since the eighteenth century championed the three principles of Consent, Choice and Contract as a means of protecting the individual in business. These bourgeois legal and economic principles have over the years taken on a social character so we use them in life, in general. We need to observe them as secular moral principles and use them wisely in all our dealings with each other. If we don’t there is a risk that we will leave ourselves open to the claim that we should have morals imposed upon us by government diktat or religious uprising, because without them we simply behave with animal-like cruelty.\nContract, choice and consent when deployed thoughtfully and particularly in all potentially intimate scenarios will provide a framework for respecting others, deter rash behaviour and prevent harm. We have much to gain by re familiarising ourselves with three of the principles of the 17th-century bourgeois revolution.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-10-02-15-to-03-05-15/content_273.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 10.02.15 to 03.05.15\n10.02 15 Why Tolerance Should Give Way To Acceptance\nWhy acceptance rather than tolerance? Well tolerance is a term used in engineering and refers to the amount of pressure or strain a material can take before its yields and bends or breaks. It might have been a word that could be applied to any society which is strong morally like a steel girder, stressed only by modest weight, as we in the west once were. However with more and more pressure applied the weight gets too much and the consequences of too much tolerance becomes collapse. It is therefore not a word which works well in a world where we are no longer that steel girder and our tolerance is too often at breaking point as the pressure gets greater. The breaking point is the problem as is the build up of the pressure.\nAcceptance fits better into our modern global scenario; for we accept many things and many faiths but we should not accept everything. We should not stand by silently like the steel girder being put under more and more weight until it fractures while injustice is all around us. We must be outspoken about what we are prepared to accept, and as importantly, what we don’t accept. There has to be a movement of people who across the globe say that they accept all faiths and none but they cannot accept injustice, cruelty or to be terrorized by anyone of whatever faith.\nSo why do we need to develop a concept of acceptance? It is because tolerance has failed to deliver stability. We acquiesce too much and burden ourselves with numerous untold problems due to our tradition of tolerance.\nAll faiths have at their heart the desire to preserve those who accept whatever faith. Mankind has always, out of necessity, sought to survive within different tribes or groups with their own single moral code and single moral purpose; all different but with one aim preservation: Tribes become kingdoms, kingdoms become nations and nations become empires. Eventually empires morally and economically over extended, decline, a process through which we are living now in the 21st century as the empire of the west seems likely to have entered its final century, the consequence of which is an unimaginable horror for those who believe in Choice and Consent.\nWhether tribe or empire the purpose is the same; to deploy a unique morality to deliver us from contingency and fear and to create value to enable our survival. The challenge comes in who controls that value or as it is better but inaccurately known wealth. Who controls the value is a political issue but its creation relies on people adhering to a particular faith. This is why we have all faiths and none, because essentially faith speaks of human survival through the creation of value.We may not like the culture of others or the faiths from which those cultures evolve but we must accept their reality and view of the world and challenge them through peace and open dialogue if the faith is being used to harm others or is failing to recognize their rights. We must not tolerate harm, but accept the reasons why that harm might be legitimised and challenge bravely that which we don’t accept.\nSo why is this approach of acceptance so relevant now. Firstly lets assume the British and American empires are simply the empires of the western world; with the decline of empire there is a consequential loss of its moral purpose and a self-indulgent aimlessness sets in based on the past rather than the future; a reaction to which is to impotently impose the will of the empire on those it fears. And this sadly when there is neither the vision, the resources nor the necessity to do so. The resultant chaos exposes the weakness of the old empire and that weakness invigorates a new tribalism which thrives intent on replacing the old empires with its perceived lack of moral purpose with a new moral empire. Unfortunately, the old empire’s attempt to impose its values by force creates the chaos that leads to the very contingency and fear mankind has spent tens of thousands of years trying to escape. It thus forces those destroyed communities into having to accept a new simple moral purpose if only as a means of survival. This is understandable but not acceptable. Arguably the west has provided a fertile environment for ISIS by causing chaos in the middle east. Tribalism returns out of necessity.\nIn our inner cities in the west we have criminal gangs and fanatics who traffic, enslave and kill whilst the authorities are impotent to control or fully understand these groups or their behaviour. This is the re-establishing of the tribal mindset within our culture. These groups can thrive because they have a simple philosophy and simple moral purpose; to survive by preserving the leadership who in turn preserves the minions. But it is a survival where the individual, long considered to be of moral worth in the west, is accorded no value at all. This is the paradox of liberalism, horror and abuse of people exists because the ability and willingness to challenge it has been muted by a confused tolerance which lasts until the tolerance gives way and wars are waged and cultures destroyed.\nAt an international level the actions of the old empire in seeking to impose “democracy” or “freedom” on its adversaries unleashes tribal instincts which attach themselves to religion and reek havoc across huge swathes of the world taking advantage of the inability of the declining empire to maintain its grip or moral purpose .\nTo stop this madness people of all faiths and none, must understand the problem of too much tolerance; the pressure, fear and chaos it creates when it breaks down and counter its seduction with a new vision of acceptance or indeed non acceptance expressed confidently. With a belief in acceptance, non acceptance and peace we must show solidarity with all peoples and all faiths by promoting peace through acceptance and where tensions exist we must engage in healthy disagreement.\nPolitics like faith has to enter the 21 century, if that is, we want to see the rights of all individuals respected and preserved all over the world as lasting legacy of the influence of the west on world culture. In two hundred years there may be little of the Western empire left; but it is essential that its legacy of the rights of individuals to speak and be heard is preserved regardless of race gender, sexuality or faith and as humans in whatever groups we find ourselves we must never again be subject to the whim of the tribe mentality or the brutal overlord.\n17.02.15 Faith and sensitivity\nThe recent criminal violence carried out in France against Charlie Hebdo, in Denmark yesterday (14/02/15) and Australia by people claiming to represent the Islamic faith, highlights serious issues on both sides of the troubled freedom of speech debate. In the West, we fail to see our own role in fuelling this violent criminality by challenging a faith that is understandable but ideologically much less able to view challenge in any terms other than as a threat to its existence. To any ideologically simple and unforgiving moral code, any threat is existential and requires a violent and uncompromising response. The reason for this is that faith was in the past and for some still is mankind’s response to the fear of being thrown back into chaos and contingency. If faith is threatened, therefore, for some people the response is going to be severe. This is not how it should be……but it is how it is.\nIn addition to the threat to the faithful presented by the direct challenge to the sensibilities of the Islamic faith such as cartoon depiction of the Prophet Mohammed; our lifestyle in the west is, in itself, a challenge.\nWe need to look at our own behaviour, the behaviour that challenges those of faith and some of no faith, for example our inability to manage within coherent family units without the collective misery of divorce or separation our reliance on single parenthood as a promoted family context within which to bring up children, our welfare system subsidising poor moral behaviour, consumption as a national preoccupation, celebrity culture and so on and so forth.\nAll this adds to the yawning gulf between the secular world and those of faith but particularly Islam. The West borrows and spends with little obvious moral purpose, other than maintain its pre-eminent global position; this is an unsustainable situation and the criminals who operate in the name of Islam know this. We need to look at both sides of the violence from and against Islamic groups and turn the war into a war of words. We cannot allow chaos to prevail as in chaos only unforgiving Islamism could survive with its brutality; something we have not yet come to recognise.\n24.02.15 East and West -morality in a conflicted world\nOver the last two weeks, we have explained our view that the lack of moral purpose in the West has contributed to the anxiety aroused in people of the Muslim and other faiths. This issue results in widespread fear and contributes to the rivalry among faiths and therefore their competing moral systems. Rivalry generally plays an enormous part in fuelling an unstable world and, in our opinion, a strong moral code based on peace will help overcome this rivalry, securing a stable world in which our children can safely grow up.\nAll moral codes are intended to preserve their different cultures from mankind’s past horror of contingency and the inability to create value to support and nourish people. Mix too many cultures together without a strong overarching “meta” value system (such as existed in the past with the Empires of Britain and the US stabilising Europe after the Second World war) and the existential anxiety will trigger violence to an extreme point. This is where we are now.\nOur own intervention in the Middle East has only made the situation worse; by exposing the problem. Where there were once dictatorships holding down the violent impulses of different groups, we now have an understandable explosion of chaos in the Middle East: the imposition of “faith” based violence and aggression a symptom of this chaos. However, whilst the faith-based violence is the action of criminals, there is little chance of these fanatical groups imposing enough mature order on the areas conquered to allow their subjugated communities to create the value necessary to thrive and survive. They simply enact barbaric and pointless acts of murder reinforcing chaos thus recreating the fear and contingency mankind has been running away from for many millennia. To be progressive you need stability, to be properly regressive you need to create chaos, or have oil wealth necessary to subdue people and to police your repressive regime…\nIn certain sections of the media, there is an odd reaction to some these barbaric regressive banalities. There seems to be a conflicted position in which some people see the criminals in the Middle East as somehow both perpetrators of violence against innocent victims but also simultaneously victims themselves. Seeing oneself as a victim as do Islamic State is the response of a group that wants to gain control sucking in followers and resources. Being treated like a victim is the way the powerful gain control of us. To some extent our desire in the West to tolerate the despots of the Middle East (and later declare war on some of them) has led certain commentators to the view that, not only is the violence due to the West but the military machine of the West and mainly the US is to blame for the victimhood of a whole faith group in the region. Hating the US appears to offer justification for treating the criminals of the Middle East as though they are genuine victims. The West is not the cause of the violence but has, instead, provided by sheer incompetence the context: the chaos in which the criminals thrive.\nSeeing victimhood as a virtue has for a long time been a problematic perspective offering little hope of betterment like the peasants of mediaeval Europe and the intergenerational unemployed in the UK today. It is a tool for control or controlling. For the survival of the real victims, the intervention of a greater force for good is required. For some commentators, the further intervention of the West sorting out the mess we have made in the Middle East is worse than allowing the greater force to come from the criminal militants themselves.\nWith no power going in to sort out the mess and I don’t mean the West, nothing will happen and the serious risk is that the criminal militants will not stop harming until someone comes along and stops them. This must happen the failure to act will simply enslave and degrade millions of innocents. Starting with Christians, gay people and other non-conformists.\nIf international socialism were still a viable option then I’m sure some would have supported that intervention, but it too would simply have done what the despots were doing for years: holding the lid down. The answer has to be to understand how the progress of the western world through the application of more and more skilful and technological means of production, has largely left the Middle East in a kind economic slow lane. In the West, we have developed our market-based capitalist system which has come to respect the right to trade and contract, move freely with goods and services so maximising personal choice. We accept that within this context, freedom of speech and faith are important parts of the deal. The only other issue one of personal concern is one’s own moral behaviour – helping to provide an environment within which one contracts one’s labour and manages one’s affairs so as to avoid depending on others and to contribute to the greater good. Contract, choice and consent are the economic outcomes from the maturing of the free market system giving rise to freedom of speech etc. They became pillars of our culture and benefit us all. Within this moral and economic context, we all created value and avoided contingency, uncertainty and fear whilst also giving rise to the demand for democracy. Sadly, in the late 21st century, many of us have lost the ability to function in a broadly moral way. Relationship issues, tax avoidance, greed, immodesty etc have taken hold. The cultural pillars described above worked because of our personal moral framework. They were designed to work in sympathy with society’s widest interests.\nTherefore, to fully understand what has been going wrong in the Middle East and the West we must draw upon our knowledge of history, philosophy and psychology.\nEssentially, the Middle Eastern societies that were, in the past, beacons of science, art and enlightenment, have slipped backwards as a result of their communities failure to become engines of their own progress through capitalism and the free market. The process of turning the trapped retainer into the contracted worker and expanding the number of opportunities that this would have provided, never really occurred and, indeed, with the discovery of oil, the need to do this – to achieve the economic value needed for supporting populations – became unnecessary. The oldest form of fascism too; man’s dominion over womankind has also in varying degrees held back progress, making families little autocracies rather than working partnerships. Thus, the situation we are all in now is that many countries in the Middle East were wealthy enough to become self-sufficient due to oil and open up opportunities for their people. However, they were unfortunately so politically unsophisticated to the extent that they fell prey to dictators who wanted complete control of oil value to create personal wealth Saddam; Gaddafi etc\nReligion in this situation becomes the conduit through which revolution was being fought, and these revolutionaries were suppressed. The ensuing tussle, resentment and the demand for change (which the West muddle-headedly interpreted as a clamour for democracy) ultimately became the justification for war.\nThe West needs to accept that the “Western Democratic Model” is probably not going to get established in the Middle East anytime soon, the value base does not accept individual rights, but acceptance of others could be a good place to start to make progress. Perhaps for a decade or so a better model would be along the lines of a ‘scrutiny’ of the dictators to ensure that very basic human rights are observed, a kind of Magna Carta. The EU could easily take on this function to ensure that places like Syria, no less undemocratic in the immediate future though they might be, are upholding very basic human rights. The drift towards opening markets and trade could then stimulate other market type phenomena such as consumer choice, consent and contract. This could be the basis for social and personal arrangements becoming more liberal and the movement towards democracy might take hold.\nWe in the West also need to make significant changes to the way in which we lead our lives so as to avoid undermining our own culture. As I mentioned above, we have lost much of our moral purpose. In many cases, our personal conduct works against the interests of others and society at large. We could look for inspiration to other, more ‘faith-based’ moral codes. For example, we did at one time find in the Middle East an approach to life that was designed to coherently hold society together to avoid contingency and fear. Unfortunately, it has been corrupted by despots, oil and war. Fostering social order creates value and enables us to create wealth, meaning we can provide for ourselves and our families and safeguard our society and its rights.\nIf we choose not to do this we risk exacerbating our differences (particularly with Islam) and ushering in a long period of escalating violence. The likelihood of the Western powers and Western people doing this is not exactly likely due to the fact that we would have to reduce our consumption and behave in a more moral way, avoiding many of the lifestyle choices we have come to expect as normal at every social level. The issue for us has a lot to do with the relationship between Companies, the Government and the taxpayer. More of this, later.\n03.03.15 The role of the faithful supporting those in need\nA slight digression from the usual stuff about morality in a globalised world with something closer to home. It is a real sign of the quiet convergence of various faiths that they see the common purpose helping the poor and those in need here in the UK. There are food banks run on behalf of church charities as well as Muslim groups in Bradford and Sikh faith groups e.g. in London who offer support to others of all faiths and no faith. We have made the point in earlier postings that the west has lost its moral purpose, which undermines its economic and social purposes; this can be partly explained by the trend for expecting governments to take over the roles within communities that are the proper stuff of charities and the communities themselves; yes there is clearly a role for government, but groups who offer a model of clear help with moral expectations, as opposed to entitlements will provide a stronger basis for future progress for those who find themselves in need of help.\nWe all have to do what we can to add value to our lives and the lives of others by what we say and what we do. The opportunities granted to us by out liberal democracy should not be undermined by adopting an overly liberal approach to anything which essentially undermines everything. This happens because in the hands of a bureaucracy people fail to develop a sense of obligation to other human beings, lacking empathy and commitment to do more than wait for the next government payment to arrive. Faith groups and some secular charities seem to understand this approach better than governments and with their intersession, a sense of positive expectation can be fostered. Understanding the links between charitable relief, the role of the family ….so important to people of faith, and self-help will bring people of all faiths and no faith together and secure a more positive future for all who need assistance. In addition, the social and economic functions of society are enhanced by the role of faith and charity. People are helped to become more functional and socially and economically active. Even in the early days of faith and religion; the role of getting the dispossessed faithful back into alignment with the larger community fell to the religious groups through charity. Back then, however (as is the case in some parts of the world today) the faithless are not considered worthy of support and harsh and brutal punishment was administered. Today we have a more accepting approach which does not judge others because we don’t have to judge them. The poor are not a threat to our society.\nTo many, this idea of a charity supporting the poor will seem like abandoning the poor to the modern workhouse. We disagree. We do not advocate the end of the government’s role in welfare just the greater role for faith and charitable groups. There is no institution advocated here, no four walls, just a caring community that expects everyone to do whatever they are capable of doing to add to the common good. This avoids the poor becoming ghettoized, marginalized and thereafter despised and ignored. It brings them back into the community as visible contributing people. Anyone can add value, adding value is not the same as wealth, many activities create social if not economic value; tidying the community and fostering children add value, selling shares simply creates wealth.\n14.03.15 What is faith for?\nSo far, we have attempted to explain our simple theory that all faiths and some beliefs that involve no religious faith have in the past played a crucial role in mankind’s development. Faith was the means by which we became functioning social units bounded by a common sense of purpose. The common purpose being to work to avoid what we call “contingency” but which perhaps is better understood as uncertainty and thereby to increase the chances of survival by productive activity. Productive activity creating the value which enabled our forebears to survive.\nWho did what in the family was an important component of this process. The better we became at controlling our environment the more value we created and the better able we were to survive. Faith was the kingpin to this wonderful process. It has to be accepted that the rules applied to society by different faiths particularly if you head way back to the past were in too many ways discriminating, they met the needs of those societies they related to at that time. However, the value created by society was often taken by the powerful and denied to those who created it. We should not, however, judge these societies on our terms; we would not have had the progress we have had since we emerged from a state of living on our instincts into one based on consciousness, had we remained a fearful group of suspicious small tribe hunter-gatherers. Faith gave mankind coherence and ensured our survival.\nFaith, therefore, was an essential component of our survival as a species…it is clearly Darwinian in its importance. However what relevance has faith now? To answer this, we need to look in more detail at what faith did for us in the past and ask are we better off without it or should we try and return to some of the basic truths contained within the faiths of our past.\nIt is important to clarify from the beginning that the way faith was used in the past to control people and enable our survival, had a historical context; so, for example, some current “faith” based societies have fetishized certain old faith-based practices. Stoning, flogging, and amputation may have been an absolute necessity in a world of fear, starvation, and uncertainty but today it is just a weird abuse of human life almost but not exactly turning human suffering and death into a spectator sport. We are not, therefore, going to even start to suggest that any faith should promote a return to that kind of thing. In fact, as the criminals of ISIS will discover it is not possible to avoid contingency crisis, fear, uncertainty, and anxiety when you are the cause of it. In situations like this people will not be able to create value and so eventual decline and slow extinction with follow on. Without oil, Saudi Arabia would have been extinct decades ago.\nWe have a good reason for saying that we no longer require draconian culture propped up by draconian faith. The reason being that we are no longer in fear of our old enemies contingency and uncertainty and therefore have developed the capacity to create value (or in the case of Saudi Arabia pump it out of the ground) without in reality having the fear that dissenters from faith will cause some kind of cataclysmic social catastrophe. The same thing does not apply to the criminals of ISIS. These throwbacks to a past age of fear and uncertainty have little if any chance of using their “faith” or criminal incompetence to create the kind of social and economic value which provides security for their children and the communities they control. They are quite simply not up to the job of building a modern nation. But as I will go on to suggest, neither are we in the west.\nWe in the west need to take a long hard look at our “culture” with its ludicrous idolatry of celebrity and pornography, our shallow obligations to one another causing mental illness on a grand scale and our requirement particularly in the UK to be paid for anything we do stripping it of all social value and rendering it merely wealth creating. The culture of welfare turning socialism into the new “opium of the people” is a new and emerging challenge and all this straddled by politicians who I honestly believe can’t see the cultural wood from the economic trees.\nWe are therefore in danger of inciting a cataclysmic clash of cultures; Faith groups but particularly Islam being fuelled by a legitimate and credible dislike of the self-destructive “culture” of the west; whilst the west blind to the obvious causes of Islam’s objections to our culture sees Islam as an existential threat. For the west, the debate becomes laughable, about Islam’s dislike of democracy and freedom. So this justifies regime change and more chaos. Hmm seems like Armageddon is almost unavoidable.\nTo bring all faiths together and create peace through acceptance we need to start to get a debate going in the west about the west. Understand Islam and all the stuff it does but contextualised it in terms of the role of all faith in all cultures. Then once we have started to sort ourselves out we can start to comment on the modern role of Islam in a world of IT, equality, contract, choice and democracy.\nIn our next post we comment on how in the west we have unwittingly recreated fear and uncertainty on a very personal level.\n15.03.15 Sorting out a moral/social/ economic problem the western way!\nWe have commented that in the west we have issues to address and by making the simple assumption the world’s problems lie elsewhere (Russia the middle East, Africa) we are being dishonest with ourselves.\nOur reaction is particularly hazardous if we fail to grasp what is really behind all faith communities’ concerns about western culture and some nonfaith groups too. Most particularly the problems we in the west must confront exist largely on a personal level rather than a political level, so it is easy to convince ourselves that everything is all right “in general”. Politicians, some established Church people and those with a stake in the status quo, can have no basis for considering anything is wrong.\nAgain, it is important to show understanding of their lack of concern, but be critical none-the-less. The reason they seem ambivalent whether police, politicians or civil servants is quite simple; social issues don’t really touch them or if they do the consequences for them can be mitigated by higher income and a higher social position. Or they are employed to try and tackle the problem, unaware that it is the flaws in our “liberal tolerant” society that cause the problems in the first place.\nIn the past faith helped mankind by bringing certainty to people’s worlds even if that certainty had cruel dimensions. Today in the west for our most vulnerable people there is little personal certainty and therefore little capacity to create value social or economic.\nTake the issue of teenage sexual exploitation. Most commentators, politicians and the police have now concluded that the fault lies with the abusers not the abused. The line here is agencies failed to react to evidence of abuse due to cultural sensitivities (since when has crime been excused based on cultural sensitivities…? Oh yes quite often; Domestic Violence, animal cruelty, FGM and so on and so forth). The major issue, however, was that within this situation there has been a clash of cultures which sadly characterises the conflicts of culture we have tried to outline in earlier posts. We have males who culturally have come to expect high moral standards from females (the woman is the citadel of Islam).\nThe Islamic faith places women behaviour on a high pedestal but like all high pedestals it will be a hard landing if you fall off, and the girls at the centre of the abuse had fallen off and their hard landing was to become viewed as their worthlessness. Now, this situation was made worse by the fact that the males and agencies who should have been protective took a similar view to the abusers; the girls were out of control etc. Which I can accept is possibly true, but is no justification for the abuse they experienced; their lives should never have been seen as worthless.\nSo, we have a toxic moral mixture which in many respects reflects the wider conflicts between of western and other cultures as seen by many faith groups and this includes Islam. Like all generalisations, there is a degree of truth within it.\nWe are sexually preoccupied and ambivalent about it. We see many others lives as worthless rather than as a reflection of the grace of their God. We have a low tolerance for the spiritual needs of others and rely on the government to step in. This is seen in many areas of society, but particularly in our past muddled response to the crisis of abused children. The states response to child abuse; lessons in consent for children!\nLessons in consent should be unnecessary in a culture where people (adults) take the time to get to know each other properly and respect each other as individuals, rather than categorising each other based on looks or affluence as young people are now tending to do. Young people learn from the adults around them and develop toxic values which leave them open to abuse.\nYoung people should see their lives as more than their outward bodily appearance and should avoid obsessing about what they could to with the physical gifts of nature bestowed on them. They should avoid benefiting themselves rather than benefitting others. Children should not be made to feel it is necessary to give or refuse consent; this path like every other “western cultural solution” has the seeds of a major disaster ticking away in its DNA.\nConsent for illegal behaviour should not be given by a child in a healthy culture, but if given by a child, encouraged by the system to exercise what should be an adult right, it will be on the basis a sad desire to be wanted; it’s a predatory charter. Once consent is given there is no “cooling off period”. Whoever dreamed up this idea for dealing with Child Sexual Exploitation should be subject to close scrutiny because as ideas go it is utterly appalling. But it reflects we suppose an utterly appalling society.\nGirls need to be raised in loving homes within a family that loves them for who they are. The adult male should be (wherever possible) the actual biological father.\nBoth should take the time to exercise choice and consent before settling down to have children and cooperate as equals in their daughter’s upbringing; even if this includes a parent staying at home to do this. The family should be a place of values and a place of safety for all. The sick spectacle of pre-teen precociousness should be seen as creepy and unacceptable, stealing childhood.\nStep-fatherhood should be an exception rather than a rule. Boys should mirror the father’s respect for the mother and should see girls as their equals, not as objects.\nAll faiths require modesty and modesty should be an expectation, particularly for children. The answer to sexual abuse is like many other things a matter of putting values back into society. Reverse the wholesale destruction of the primary family unit. The fact that too many stakeholders can’t bring themselves to say this, explains why when the system looks at the issue, the solutions are muddled and perverse. Preserve the status quo and achieve nothing more than more harm, abuse and unhappiness. Changing things for the betterment of children might just make life less exciting, more responsible and routine for adults but then you can’t go on blaming cultural sensitivity and the failure of expensive state agencies when children continue to copy adults, sexual behaviour and too many are abused.\nThe fact that in too many parts of the west adults put themselves first and pervert the environment for their children is the reason why faith communities see the west as weak and self-destructive. Raising stable families freed from the fear of emotional uncertainty who can be socially, if not economically productive, requires time and effort. In the absence of this time and effort from parents, the government has to pay for it…..and paying they are, or perhaps more accurately we all are!\n22.03.15 Tunisian museum tragedy- The criminals Vs the West V1\nThe horror of the shootings at the museum in Tunisia only serves to highlight the impasse between the criminals who identify themselves as Muslim and the rest of the peoples of the world. The fear we have is that this is a war neither side can win; it’s a Mutually Assured Destruction but fought with bombs, bullets and brutality as opposed to the technologically out of reach Weapons of Mass Destruction. Although that could, of course, come later.\nThe statement by ISIS was chilling in its content as for the first time we heard a statement to the effect that all westerners are legitimate targets simply for being westerners; There is no attempt to distinguish one from any other; this is the criminals setting themselves against the world in all its beautiful and wonderful diversity. The west and the world must now be starting to recognise that here we have a culture of brutality and ignorance that will not respond to any kind of appeal to better nature, common sense or humanity. So how do we deal with it? As to deal with it, we must.\nThe first thing the west needs to do as we have said many times before is look at itself and the way its culture might adversely affect the planet and challenge the world’s morality. Western culture has many obvious flaws some of which we have referred to in previous posts so won’t re-rehearse them again here. What we have not explored to date is why the west has considerable social problems that often become economic in character. These problems create victims, financial winners and losers and spawn often deplorable lifestyles around which a fetishized obsession develops among many people of faith, and which becomes incendiary within the minds of criminals who adopt Islam as a cloak of legitimacy for their violence and brutality.\nIn the minds of many people of faith, the western world is adopting an illegitimate way of life, based on a concept of wealth which has for decades owed little to our ever-decreasing productive capacity. This is for us the essential weakness of western culture and the hair trigger for violence against us. We magic up from nowhere the wealth of such enormous size and complexity that it flows around the planet; not doing good but creating the context for lifestyles that are as unsustainable as the “Dust Bowl” Islamism favoured by ISIS.\nThe capacity to produce true value in the west is considerably smaller than the amount of wealth created on the back of that value. The wealth which has little real value flows around and unfortunately ends up all too often in the hands of either the corrupt or the criminal. For every Bill Gates, there are far too many racketeers and hucksters in every country in the world, inspiring fear, and frustration at one level and hatred and violence at the other.\nThe solution to this massive global problem is the west recognising that a lot of what is called wealth is nothing of the sort. It has no real value and the people who have it may not be particularly deserving of it but have just got lucky. This applies to businesspeople and perhaps more appropriately our celebrities and those who feed off the dreams of others, pop stars and the like.\nThe glitz and glamour funded by worthless debt-based wealth which is pumped into the system by frightened Governments who fear war and revolution if the money-go-round slows down. For the rest of us, the money-go-round is simply a form of enslavement trapping us into faithless and pointless lifestyles which offer little hope of happiness or salvation and which because it is debt based widens the difference between value and wealth even further.\nWealth without any value is simply an immoral hoarding of someone else’s debt. So for us the driver for our unsustainable western lifestyle is our ability to create money with no value and to thereby fund lifestyles of no value…….with all the attributes you would expect; abandoned elderly, divorce, adultery, illegitimacy and so on and so forth. These horrors will happen and in a tolerant western society for some time to come, we guess it is to be expected. That is why the Western governments are compelled to deploy wealth harvested from real production to tackle the problem but augment this with consumption based on indebtedness.\nAs lifestyles go we have come to practice the above all too casually, and on an almost industrial scale. So when Criminals identify themselves as Muslims and looks at the west they can see a lifestyle which is bogus, inhuman and essentially unsustainable paid for by money created in an Alice in Wonderland economy.\nSuch a view triggers the violent instinct that believes a dose of dust bowl Islamism will cure the west of its ills. The purity of a simple desert life with apostates being beheaded and adulterers stoned seems to be a way of solving the very crux of the west’s obvious problem, but that problem isn’t simply moral it’s economic too; that is too much money chasing too little morality.\nWe believe many people of faith will agree with the above, hence we suspect the number of converts to Christianity, Islam and other faiths may well increase. In addition, there may be a return to primitivism within some faiths. However what people of true faith will not be interested in doing is destroying the culture and character of their faith or the faith of others and replace it with, for example, a 7th-century dust bowl variety of faith, based on brutality and fear.\nPeople with deep and enlightened faith will adopt a faith-based lifestyle for themselves which puts some much-needed morality back into lives blighted by too little social or productive activity. Our weight gain and poor health our idleness and self-obsession are easily identifiable symptoms of the problem\nThe ISIS criminals want to destroy western wealth which they fetishize as the cause of our problems. As we have said our wealth creation needs to be brought down to a level where it has a closer approximation to an actual value created (less froth more real value) and is less prone to drift into the wrong hands, but the west should not and does not deserve to be destroyed. The ISIS dust bowl has absolutely no productive capacity and as we have said previously it is the role of individuals, families, tribes, nations and empires to create value to sustain themselves. ISIS destroys not only wealth but value and by destroying value they will ultimately destroy themselves.\nWe think in our next blog post I’ll look at the humanity and freedom the west offers the world and explore this strange notion of value.\n30.03.15 Tunisian museum tragedy- The criminals Vs the West V2\nValue plays a key role in all societies and was particularly significant in the past. There was in the very early days of mankind’s existence social value generated by individuals observing their belief system, enabling them to produce economic value with minimal fear, harmoniously in most cases, to provide the food to support their families and community.\nWar was then, as now the destruction of value usually by one group against another but sometimes within the same group. Faith was closely linked to stability; therefore any behaviour outside of the “norm” which affected the ability to provide food to support the whole community required serious retribution. It made no sense to waste value on transgressors. Some faiths still support the practice of harsh punishment because the link to their past is still quite strong and the link to the perception of survival is raw.\nAs society moved forward technologically this social value became a bit less important as more complex social arrangements emerged; detached from the survival issue by technology albeit only plough and Oxen the link was weakened further between what people did and whether they contributed directly to the general survival of all or could lived on the value produced by others. By this time economic value could be stored in the form of money or other valuables rather than immediately consumed. It was at this point that politics emerged as a force, competing with faith not only to control people’s minds but control the value they created. This was the shift from pre-agricultural society to post agriculture; organisation, primitive technology, and investment began to emerge.\nThe value created was economic value on a greater scale. Once value could be created and stored rather than immediately consumed, “faith” became a means by which the ruling classes (Kings, Pharaohs etc) exercised control to ensure that people surrendered their share of the economic value they produced to the ruling class. Society was pretty much like this for millennia; with the west and their reformation most recently starting the process of gradually weakening the control of the kings, and via capitalism, and then in some places socialism, reallocating value to the “organisers of the means of production” or government respectively.\nThe ancient Egyptians had a society that took the value from the Nile and created a Kingdom which lasted five thousand years. The value was not sent back to the people who created it and many Biblical stories reflect this period of slavery; value creation, requisition, submission, and control. The stories capture the role of faith in tackling the issue of value requisition and how the societies involved, tackled the problem. For the Egyptian society to last five thousand years the faith of the people in the legitimacy of that society and their place in it must have been very strong.\nValue is therefore whatever is created by an individual or society that allows them to survive. It can be stored and accumulated, gave rise to complex societies and its existence in a stored form is why politics was born. Value is the birth mother of politics, and faith its handmaiden.\nNow there was a limit to how much you can accumulate and store value in hard coinage and bullion terms. We suspect the reason the Pharaoh’s survived as long as they did was because the value that the Nile created was sufficient to allow them to hoard a lot of value, and employ and feed workers and slaves and this coupled to people’s faith in the gods made the whole enterprise legitimate for all concerned. The Pharaoh’s were essentially the guarantors of stability and sustenance for all. They removed the fear and contingency that in mankind’s very early days, faith alone had done; by spending some of the surplice value on “projects” that employed and fed people.\nThe birth of politics had weakened faith as men and more recently women began to realise that the status quo could be challenged. The allocation of economic value away from those who actually created it was viewed as wrong. Faith, unfortunately, became popularised as “the opium of the people” by thinkers like Karl Marx; thus it became seen as a reactionary force, holding society back. Enterprise which is essentially the creation of economic value is of course a good thing, so there needs to be some premium paid to the person who organises the production process. But really should the economic and social system be so perverse a system that it creates today’s super rich. Those of faith could now do more to challenging the system.\nThis concept of the super rich in today’s society (people on par with the Kings of the past) brings me onto the next theme of this post. That is how, over thousands of years, from value being pretty much what humans picked off trees, pulled out of the ground or killed, it became sufficiently plentiful and storable for people with big sticks to hoard it, deny it to others and make themselves rich. What has happened since this time of the initial hoarding of value is that the kings have gone (although the oligarchs in Russia and the thugs of ISIS are an obvious throw backs to the men with big sticks. In the case of ISIS however there is no value to be created from new and future production. They are essentially parasites with no economic capacity, simply a perverted idea of social value they impose with brute force, dust bowl Islam as I call it).\nThe western world has created the conditions for the super rich to emerge. Since the early days of economics in Biblical times the world has created lots of cleaver ways of making a little value look like a lot of wealth, rather than creating more actual value. Creating real economic value is hard work;it involves combing land, labour and capital in proportions which make a profit. Making a little value look more impressive is relatively easy, once you have the financial smoke and mirrors set up.\nIn the west there is little promotion of social value (old fashioned faith type value for example or doing something for nothing) and a reliance on debt rather than the creation of economic value. This debt is brought into existence with some cleaver tricks of accounting, allowing money to be printed to stimulate “consumption”. By leaving our faith base we have become too entitled and moved our governments into a world of “Alice in Wonderland” economics to drive the economy. In such an economy a pea sized amount of value can be turned into a planet sized amount of wealth via debt. Of course the major problem is the poor pay for this and the and the rich acquire it; including Russell Brand…whoever he is. Wealth creation is where the fun starts as it involves Banks and Governments and bogey men of all descriptions.\nSo what we have now after a millennia and more of growth and development in our “Financial Services” is a total disconnection between value (which is something be it social or economic that has to be on a human scale and created by complex human activity as opposed to pressing button on a computer) and wealth which is no longer linked to value and which can be multiplied out of all recognition based on airy fairy concepts such as confidence or belief in the market. This is the real problem for those of faith who believe in things being both real and on a human scale and having social as well as economic dimensions. The problem for those of faith and the more enlightened of those with no faith is that we are simply peddling a broken economic model which taxes the poorer to create wealth for the richer and in doing so undermines our moral purpose; there is little in the way of real value supporting or underpinning the whole teetering edifice.\nOur economic model malfunctions due to a number of modern phenomenon driven by our drift from faith and belief in the need for survival. Welfarism; paying people to be idle and simply exist for themselves or to farm babies on an often industrial scale to tap off wealth for themselves wealth created by taxpayers and government debt. It also works through the public sector; paying people to do jobs that should not be necessary if society functioned to create social and economic value. Well paid jobs bankrolled on the back of a debt economy that costs the poorest the most through taxes they have no choice but to pay.\nSome public sector salaries in Great Britain are twice or three times what the British Prime Minister earns. How odd is that. Not odd at all if you consider that the upper reaches of the Public sector including Westminster politics has become the occupation of choice for many in the British upper classes. Well that or Acting! Finally with all this valueless wealth sloshing around, largely created for and on behalf of the Government “the rich” are able to tap it off by creating businesses which appeal to people’s baser drives for example sexual services and “want” based consumption. The whole thing is offensive to those of faith and some of no faith because it reflects a race to the moral bottom, creating debt for the Government and the poor, whilst rewarding the “rich” for whom their principle moral reaction to their good fortune is to pay as little tax on profits or earnings as possible\nThe upshot of this system is that the economy does what it is doing now…..it starts to fail. We have referred to how this failure manifests itself socially; divorce and illegitimacy on an industrial scale, domestic violence, obsessions around spending and consumption, a society of entitlement rather than social or economic duty. How far we have come technologically yet morally we are little better than our squabbling ancestors trying to make sense of a strange frightening and confusing world whilst allowing the overlords to take most of the wealth. The difference is; we started to sort it out once and now we are throwing the legacy away.\nIn a future blog post we hope to explore two key elements of the modern western world by looking at how the “relationship” industry and housing industry work in a morally unacceptable way. Both are a product of the poverty in social and economic value, and both reflect the flight from faith and Darwinian survival; both sowing the seeds of the unfortunate and unnecessary but relentless destruction of the west and its diverse culture based on choice, contract, and consent.\n06.04.15 Tunisian museum tragedy- The criminals Vs the West V3\nWe seem to be unintentionally creating the conditions in the world where Christians are being killed simply for being Christians. Whilst blame should and will always remain with the criminals we must look at contexts to understand the situation with a little more sophistication. Christians are being butchered in some of the most barbaric ways imaginable as well as simply being mown down by gunfire. The perpetrators of this behaviour are a murderous class of criminals who identify themselves with Islam, but who fail to understand the difference between Christianity and the more widely known secular western culture.\nI can well imagine the fanatics in the caves and compounds viewing western culture and hating every second of it whilst at the same time being strangely aroused by the freedoms, particularly sexual freedoms on offer in the west which true Christians feel are as absurd as many of other faiths and none. I have written about this in an earlier post. When barbarity stops being a reaction to possible extinction it becomes fetishised. The Saudi Arabian culture captures this most profoundly. People (many I am sure poor, mentally ill etc) experience their last, sad, pathetic moments of life as a spectator sport, at the Friday beheadings. Now this template of Islamic culture has a wide appeal and along with intolerance, sexual prejudice, and obsession for cultural purity is alluring for those who despise the west. In this scenario things like the west’s sexual freedom come to justify cruelty towards Christians on an unimaginable scale.\nThe sexual freedom the west has experienced for most of the last fifty years has unfortunately let to widespread and indifferent promiscuity with all the personal tragedy that this throws up. However whilst the response should be that you don’t kill people because you object to what is seen as their culture it becomes more compelling when the justification is a mix of cultural hatred and sexual excitement.\nThere are those in the west with a fetishized fascination with death; on the internet death is viewed as entertainment by the immature curious and perverted. Within fanatical groups the voyeur becomes the practitioner, where motivated by a desire for retribution arising from their own repressed sexual excitement the blood lust becomes fanatical indeed. ISIS and al Shabab are reacting with violence and cruelty because they hate arousal, particularly sexual arousal that western culture causes them. Dealing with the whole western moral swamp is the western world’s biggest challenge.\nThis brings me to the point about ISIS and al Shabab criminality and the abuse of Christianity. In my opinion Christians are being slaughtered because of the moral “sins” of the western world; yet no Christian would sanction the kind of behaviour which the Criminals of ISIS et al find so arousing. There is no place in Christianity for immodesty, pornography and greed. So when ISIS or al Shabab kill Christians they are killing people who have a certain view of how life should be lived which would be in harmony with their own if they were not simply criminals hell bent on blood lust and slaughter.\nFor all faith’s and those of no faiths to live in harmony the west to turn back to a more moral way of living not just Christian living, but any moral code which promotes moral behaviour. In world like this Criminal gangs of ISIS and Al Shabab would have no support within the ranks of their own professed faith, they would have to stop killing and grow up.\n06.04.15 Britain- a Christian country? Some mistake surely\nBritain’s Prime Minister David Cameron was not alone in suggesting this Easter that Great Britain is a Christian country. Whilst quite rightly endorsing, as we do, that we accept all faiths and those of no faith the idea Britain is Christian rather than secular liberal is one of the reasons why Christianity is despised by many who hold a strong faith be it Islamic or Buddhist or whatever faith or set of guiding moral principles including Darwinism. However not surprisingly traditional Christians too reject the outcomes arising from the destruction of faith-based morality and the promotion of the secular liberal moral sursum corda stripped of all moral content.\nIt would be more correct to point out that Britain was a Christian country but is no longer (just look at the declining attendance numbers at Church) however it has a Christian tradition which when coupled to economic freedom drove the British economy to a level of global power which has never been surpassed. If you take out the specifically “Christian” elements of Christ and the Gospels; what Christianity helped to create in Britain whilst constraining within moral boundaries, were the three elements upon which western culture and latterly the west’s freedoms evolved; namely consent, contract and choice. These are elements within the world’s DNA of which Britain can rightly be proud. Yet without the moderating influence of Christian morality these elements throw up horrors and perversity of a truly deplorable kind; family breakdown, pornography, abuse and exploitation, illegitimacy, idleness and greed. Without a moral framework contract, choice and consent create the seeds of the west’s slow destructive devolution and perversely make other “rule” as opposed to “conscience” based faiths seem more legitimate.\nJust a thought at Easter.\n08.04.15 What happens when rules replace morality?\nIf you look at what is happening in Britain and the rest of the western world something quite odd is going on. In earlier times we had to rely in strict rules and justification for our day to day behaviour. The reason as earlier posts have explained is the need to protect value…an essential component in any society which expects to survive. As we have matured, we became less reliant on “rules” imposed from outside of ourselves and accepted that some rules were just good in observance and seemed to come from within. This conferred legitimacy. This is morality coming from within us and not imposed from without us. The problem was that certain things like sexuality became subject to this moral code and were considered unacceptable; homosexuality for example. However, what has replaced morality is a set of rules that the state is required to enforce. This is expensive and lacks “buy in”. Are we really a society that respects all faiths and no faith groups or indeed people who choose a different lifestyle? Do we really support all who are none-the -less are value promoting and legitimate?\nWhat has happened is that we have created a rule-based society-like we had in our distant past. The difference now is that these rule based modern societies or rather their governments are not protecting social and economic value by consuming a small proportion of that value to preserve the rest; they are creating debt based wealth to uphold their rules even though those rules are decent and well intentioned it costs a lot to uphold them. It was once said that history repeats itself; the first time as tragedy the second time as farce. That sort of explains where we are now re-establishing a rule-based society funded by borrowed money to preserve a society that creates no value. The rules may or may not be right but the cost of upholding them is unaffordable. They need to be come moral faith based rather than rule based to survive and preserve the west’s culture of contract choice and consent.\nUnless people and particularly politicians understand these contradictions in how we rely on rules the values of the hard right or rule-based faiths start to look legitimate; hence Russia as the upholder of Christendom and ISIS et al the upholders of Islam. Wow – what a combination.\n19.08.15 A message to the Jihadi “brides”\nThere has been much speculation about why you would have chosen to go to Syria and become the brides of the criminals fighting out there. It has been said that it was because the police didn’t stop you or somehow your education failed you. , I don’t want to go into any of that, no do I want to suggest you were “groomed” on the internet. No, I want to suggest to you that you went because you wanted to go; you saw, as I see, as a person of faith, that some activities are morally worthwhile. The view you have adopted will see the decadence of what you rather naively see as Christendom as an affront to Islam. If you agree with me so far you must accept that Western culture is, as I have said before, in its more deranged manifestations, an insult to Christianity and all other faiths too, not just Islam.\nHowever, whilst the west parted company from Christianity decades ago the desire to slay the beast of Christendom continues. You I believe were drawn to what you will probably argue is this moral cause. However, a word of caution…you may be devout and Muslim but you are also western. Let me explain.\nAs a western woman you will have become used to being listened to and to use an irritating “right on phrase” having a voice. You expect this because you are educated and happy and alive. The opportunity to be like this comes from the western world’s belief that you have rights….not conferred by your husband or your religion but by your western culture. You have the right to choose; for example what to wear, who to marry, whether you want to have a sexual relationship………or whether you don’t, whether you want a job or children. In your new world this choice will be taken away. Your husband will decide all this for you and your “voice” will be drowned out in a hail of anger and violence. Your western culture affords you the right to consent, you may choose to marry but not consent to being beaten or being forced to wear a veil or have children or worse. In your new world the concept of consent does not really have any place. No one is consenting to anything. It is brute force and ignorance on an industrial scale. Finally, you can contract so that what you agree, you can expect, be it the mundane purchase of a washing machine or a service of any other sort for example health care. In your new world social contracts are a piece of decadent western nonsense so when something harmful happens, you will not be treated with kindness and get sensible recompense; you will be lucky if you are spared any time or humanity at all.\nFinally, the criminals of ISIS will not like your views, views that you should expect to contract have choice and consent to things that affect you. These western values will in all probability be beaten out of you, so you become a Jihadi bride, uncontaminated and cleansed of western decadence and western rights.\nBut whilst I can see your strong faith as the motivation for joining Isis….. as I have suggested above frankly you are not what they want, you are too cleaver, sensible, sane and have the normal expectations of any western woman, that you live your life your way. The fact that in the west we abuse and debase our rights making short term stupid moral choices does not mean our rights are wrong, just that some of us are wrong, as you will no doubt be discovering from some ISIS controlled sand pit somewhere in Syria. Oh and the same applies to the boys as well.\n26 April 15 The new seven deadly sins\nOver the next seven weeks I am going to explore the concept of sin from the perspective of what I want to call the “new seven deadly sins”. The old “sins” remain problematic; gluttony, Ire, Greed etc but whereas in the past such behaviours would undoubtedly have caused harm to others in the longer term the harm is significantly less pronounced today and in many ways these old sins affect the perpetrator much more than the recipient. The new sins are in my view both more problematic and in the long term more harmful to the perpetrator, recipient and society at large, although as with everything faith related the real harm from modern moral decline does not in all cases impact immediately but slowly by stealth over time. I hope also that these new “sins” can form the basis for inter faith discussion as many of them both challenge and conform to faith based ideas of what is sinful, whilst placing these sins within the context of the twenty first century.\nTo start with I will simply list them in the order in which I consider their seriousness; staring with what I consider to be the most sinful of all behaviours. I will explore these sins in more details over the following weeks.\n03.05.15 Deadly sin number 1: Cruelty\nThere is obvious cruelty such as that committed by ISIS et al however this as I have suggested previously more akin to serious and violent crime than a mere sinful act perpetrated on another individual or ones-self. So, what do I consider to be cruelty which falls short of a crime? That which does not include harming animals or being violent towards one another.\nOne of the problems people of genuine faith feel about the modern world is that there is too much emphasis on each of us getting our own way; having what we want; being stimulated for example by drink drugs or sex. Cruelty is what is carried out when someone realises, they may have made a mistake but not before they have allowed themselves to get into a situation that they subsequently discover they don’t like. The sort of cruelty I am referring to therefore is most often but not exclusively seen within families or other close nit groups. Cruelty has to have an element of viciousness or vindictiveness about it and the aim of the perpetrator is to cause hurt as a response to an error of judgement they may have made in getting into a situation they no longer value respect or like. Racism is cruelty; antisemitism is cruelty at the level of picking on some individual with hurtful words which fall short of being a crime; beyond that is clearly a crime. However thankfully aside from a small group of criminals; some self-identified as people of faith, this type of cruelty is comparatively rare.\nThe cruelty which I believe to be more common is the cruelty played out in homes all over the place. We rush into ill-considered relationships driven by our out of control sex drives urged on by a combination of the reproductive instinct and the stimulation of the drug and dream like effects of sexual activity itself. We don’t stop ourselves from this headlong rush to get “intimate” and indeed there are people who see little harm in widespread promiscuity. However the prevalence of promiscuity reflects two fundamental issues closely linked to cruelty; the extent to which people throw away something which should be special; their naked physical presence in the company of a partner whom they wish to love and cherish, and from whom they expect the same, and the lack of any really considered application of thought about whether the relationship has any long term value. By the time these decisions have been made there may be children and responsibility the boredom of a relationship with a partner with whom one has “intimacy” but whom one neither respects of loves. This is the environment within which cruelty breeds. It is manifest in a number of acts some easily understood such as adultery, all the way down to causing someone to worry (staying out later than agreed and not returning concerned calls), words of indifference “oh do what you want”, words of irritation “oh go away” to words designed to cause harm “you are stupid/ugly/useless”. These casual acts of cruelty harm the recipients emotionally and ultimately are a sign that someone has made a poor life choice but is unprepared to take responsibility for it. Cruelty causes depression and suicide drug and alcohol misuse. I think the proliferation of pornography is to meet the needs of men and women trapped into unsatisfactory relationships yet preoccupied with sex; and its use can be an act of cruelty itself. At the most extreme the toxic context of cruelty can provide the self-justification for domestic violence and child abuse particularly in “reconstituted households”. This is the reason that in the western world I consider cruelty to be the deadliest of the seven deadly sins. To avoid sinning we need to return to a way of life that requires us to consider our relationships carefully and avoid getting into situations where cruelty is the means of feeling better about ourselves in our self-inflicted dire situation. The West championed the three concepts of Consent, Choice and Contract as a means of protecting the individual, we need to observe them but use them wisely otherwise we will leave ourselves open to the claim that unfettered by “rules” we simply behave like animals.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_is-populism-the-elites-way-of-minimising-humanities-third-and-final-revolution/content_245.html": "The elite are scared of the reality of humanities final ‘revolution’!\nHumanity has experienced two revolutions in the last 10,000 years. Two revolutions since we were able to create more wealth than we needed as a species to survive. When this happened, it was possible to distribute it equally or alternatively for one man and his family or group to acquire that wealth and acquire the power that went with it. This latter model was revolution number one, it took much of humankind from hand to mouth tribal reality into the world of power, politics and inequality, in short, political authority was born. Whole systems of laws and faith were created to promote the ‘normality’ of this arrangement.\nReligion tried to compensate for the inequality of this new economic world order. However economic reality cast aside the idealised visions of heaven on earth promoted by faiths like Judaism Christianity and Islam and gave only heaven in heaven.\nThis system of aristocratic families ‘owning’ almost all the wealth created by slaves and workers continued for thousands of years slowly moving out from the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Eventually, it arrived in Europe by the turn of the second millennium. Britain was probably too swampy, cold and hilly to generate enough wealth for anyone to waste time trying to acquire it after the Romans left……until 1066 or thereabouts.\nOnce Britain became subject to this autocratic feudal exploitation, any notion of equality disappeared and lives became a struggle to survive, not just survive against nature herself but against powerful ‘political’ forces too. Natural events shaped the reality of everyone’s lives, but whether it was war or famine the ‘top people’ the aristocracy always fared much better than those toiling at the bottom. And moreover, the ‘top people’ fought the ‘rabble’ to ensure the survival of their system.\nFamine was a reality for the poor, but famine and plague were touch papers for the next great revolution. Again, economics played the most significant role. A shortage of labour drove up wages creating a class of trading merchants who by increasing their wealth could challenge the rights of crown, church and aristocracy.\nFamine stoked riots but also stimulated agricultural innovation. The feudal system was quietly being undermined from the economic base. The religious legitimacy of a feudal ruler was now capable of being challenged by a class of people wealthy because of hard work and enterprise. Eventually, revolution number two swept away British Catholicism and promoted the work ethic.\nBy the seventeenth century, having been convulsed by revolution number two which whilst superficially about religion had its real origins in economics, the merchant class amassing a popular revolt finally took away through revolution the power of the king.\nCapitalism was born from the ashes of the feudal system. Like all revolutions, it salvaged what it could from the ‘old ways’ adopting feudalisms top-down structure but with an economic model based on new ideas like the freedom to acquire wealth using principles of contract, choice and consent. Capitalism paid for its power outsourcing control to parliaments and courts rather than acquiring its own power based on feudal entitlement, status and birthright.\nThis populist revolution created the basis of our present Parliamentary and legal system. A mixture of feudalism and capitalism; a kind of political labradoodle. Not one thing nor the other! Very expensive, class-based but not status based. However, the elite capitalists paid for the system out of the profits made for them by the working class. Workers paid nothing directly to the state until about the twentieth century.\nThis model worked on and off, well into the twentieth century, notwithstanding the odd crisis or the wars it caused when it failed in places like Germany in the 1900s or 1930s. Where it has been successful it has for two hundred years underpinned freedom and rights to contract, make personal choices and consent to lives in general. Also unlike the other two other systems which pre dated it, tribalism and feudalism it has been flexible enough to extend rights to all adults by the late twentieth century. The left doesn’t understand the concept, but the world’s future should not be about socialism but about progressive capitalism. The rights-based equality of progressive capitalism is why ideologies promoted by the UN that hate equality, particularly for women, are turning capitalism into a hated ideology to be destroyed because of its origins in white European economics. As well as attacks from autocrats, ill-informed socialists and religious cranks, capitalism has its own problems too.\nBy the 1970s capitalism was again beginning to fail. Most of us didn’t realise it because just like the elite of the sixteenth century holding on to their feudal power, our ‘global’ elite began selling us the idea that all’s well in the global economy by creating the global ‘free market’. This approach enables them to hang onto their power. The so-called left-wing assist, acting like useful idiots using the new religion of ‘identity and diversity’ which differentiates the working class and sows class oppression and class confusion. So within the framework of capitalist rights and free market muddle have we got to the point of a third and probably final popular uprising or revolution?\nCapitalism needs both the supply of goods and just as importantly the demand for them. Henry Ford paid his workers’ good wages and gave them time off so they could not only afford to buy a car…..they had time to drive it for leisure. Today we have broken this link between productive workers and consumers. We have out of the ashes of a broken capitalist system turned to debt to create the demand for products which as we consume them, make our global elite very rich but the debt both government and personal makes us poor. This is for us the first whammy. We pay with debt for a system that makes a political and economic elite rich.\nIn our globalised world our global elite doesn’t pay tax and moreover, they don’t employ many people. Those they do employ are on low wages, work in oppressive countries or at home their jobs are often subsidized by our governments and that means the taxpayer foots the bill. This is the second whammy.\nThe third and final whammy is that our whole debt based political and legal system is now very expensive having grown in size and scale since the end of the second world war. Now, of course, we ordinary workers have to pay for it.\nSo, what does this mean? It means we need another revolution. Revolution number three. A revolution based on working peoples twenty-first-century global economic realities. So in summary we have populism because:\n- The political and economic system is more expensive than it has ever been but now ordinary workers, rather than the elite pay for it.\n- Governments encourage debt to maintain the illusion that the economy works. It doesn’t, no economy can rely on debt and welfare forever.\n- Working people’s voices have become excluded from political debate due to the end of open politics. Our current economic system has no money to distribute so left-wing politics is irrelevant and the capitalist system is now a bankrupt free-market relying on worker serviced private and government debt, so right-wing politics is irrelevant- we no longer need to debate this stuff we need a revolution!\n- To preserve the rights, we gained with capitalism the right to contract, choose and consent, we need to ensure the free market survives. But that free markets survival can’t be based on debt. We need to shrink the bloated, unaccountable undemocratic and expensive state and give workers more time and more money to run our nation on our behalf. This is not socialism. This is not the power of the state controlling our lives but our lives controlling the state.\nIs this revolution a long way off?\nAs working people, we are still holding out for a hero a Nigel Farage or Donald Trump? Or we are holding out for a political ‘party’ to save us. In France, they thought it was Macron! Any person or party which has to fit into our 18th-century political system will fail.\nThe system within which our heroes and parties operate is broken just like the economy. We need a new system that promotes our western values but doesn’t rely on the past political system to deliver our future. We need a revolution, a peoples revolution, a revolution of the independently minded blue collar worker. A Blue Revolution to bring religion to heel, promote equality, control top public sector wages, make corporations pay tax on national earnings, give workers more money and time and shrink the state so we can afford to live in it.\nThat is the workers challenge for the twenty first century.\nJon Steen\nThe Monopolism we have imposed on us will collapse. But we must fill the vacuum with our own community government not one of warlords and gangsters as preferred and promoted by the Globalists",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_whats-going-on-well-as-karl-marx-said-history-repeats-itself-the-first-time-as-tragedy-the-second-time-as-farce/content_107.html": "What’s going on in the world? Well as Karl Marx said “history repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce”.\nWe can assume that capitalism didn’t fail before it was created so we have the first tragedy of capitalism in the late 1920’s leading to the Second World War a decade later. Capitalism was rescued by that war and later fake news militarism in the US and welfarism in the UK provided the economic stimulus that let “neoclassical” economics reboot capitalism and then presides over a slow relentless decline until western capitalisms death in the mid 1980’s. The Second World War war was the tragedy….and today post the 1980’s we have the farce. How so?\nWell, capitalism has failed again. If you don’t believe us just consider what capitalism needs to justify its name. It needs capital and that capital has to be the misappropriated value taken from the workers who created it by, you guessed it Capitalists. What we have now is the ridiculous spectacle of the rich simply and like Sir Phillip Green lazily tapping off the proceeds of workers and taxpayer debt, acquired in the form of profit for rubbish mostly manufactured at low cost in China. This is not capitalism…this is the free market. The free market is the “farce” in Marx’s quote above.\nSo when capitalism is exhausted to the point of extinction in the Western world and the “state” has given up trying to tap off economic value from capitalist because they no longer exist (rich people are not the same as capitalists whatever Britain’s Labour Party think) we are all encouraged to turn to the smoke and mirrors, the Alice in wonderland alchemy of debt. Debtamorphosis is what we call it. No one really understands how this debt based system drives odd behaviours and creates values that are unfair to the poor. Debt also promotes lifestyles that, whilst not exactly immoral are hardly mainstream. Welcome to the Marxian 21st-century farce.\nWe will consider this later but it is not pretty. Handbagging between the west and Russia, “fake news”, proxy wars between adolescent nations that are still to grow up and a western world that is narcissistic, obsessed with itself and yet self-loathing enough like some neurotic bingeing on debt before throwing up at each and every economic convulsion since 1945.\nThe free market needs to create only one side of the economic binary of demand and supply, and unlike in the old days when supply created it’s own demand via wages and profits now the system needs only to have demand. But with the link to production, working and wages severed the demand has to come from somewhere and it comes from debt. That is the dirty secret that a few “oddballs” talk about on programmes like Russia Today but their smugnesses the western mainstream media ignore.\nBut a debt based economy has many flaws. Firstly it is unsustainable as the debt can never be paid off as it simply goes into immediate consumption. That is why the screeching socialist of Corbyn’s Momentum have no idea what they are talking about. Debt based “anti-austerity” without a corresponding productive investment is simply wasted on the here and now. And the biggest waster of debt would be the left wing’s sanctified socialist state.\nThe next problem with debt is planetary. Whilst we grumble and Corbyn’s Momentum screech about “austerity” the poorer parts of the world look on in horror as valueless debt based wealth gobbles up the planet’s resources to meet the shallow needs of the western worlds entitled consumers. The world is being destroyed not simply be consumption….but by its progenitor, debt.\nDebt is as we all know tomorrows consumption today. So it affects the young who have to pay off the debt and in doing so maintain their own consumption paid for by more debt. The additional burden the Wests young have though is with their already indebted governments. These governments help to indebt the young with student loans and higher house prices (a direct result of the cash-raising against their asset price inflated property of the baby boomers). It could not be worse for the young. The solution, build more houses, invite in more migrant workers to ensure demand and borrow more money which is the left wing answer simply makes matters worse. Worse because new houses will simply become an asset against which working people can borrow more cash. Without that debt however the economy will quickly contract. Real as opposed to a pretend austerity.\nSo within all this, the beneficiaries of the debt based economy, essentially the wealthy public servants and the financial elite know that at some point ordinary people will not simply be mentally pauperised by stupidity they will be financially pauperised by debt. They the elite, however, will jet off to join the other world elites who using more traditional forms of exploitation (like pumping oil out of the ground and keeping the sales receipts) have carved out places of pleasure in more agreeable parts of the globe like Dubai.\nThis final point explains the “Big Ticket” consequences of our 21st-century farce. World tensions and fake news. The world has too much debt to go to war. No one could prosecute a serious conflict for more than about a week. And with nuclear weapons and so much synergy between most modern nations who would want to go to war anyway. So we have conflict zones where a scaled-down battle rages between those who can see the West’s debt-based economic model for what it is an Alice in Wonderland alchemy, for example, The Russian Federation, ISIS, North Korea, and Iran and those who think the model creates a haven for liberty but who simply fail to understand how it really doesn’t do that at all.\nIn addition to the proxy wars, we have the farce of fake news. Fake news has been a staple of the western world for years. Who the hell knew what was really going on in the 1950’s to 1990’s. However only now is news being used to “call out” the Western hegemony for the debt-fuelled nonsense it really is. And the western powers don’t like it. Fake news in the new farcical “cold war”\nThe sad truth is that western politicians are too stupid to understand how they are being played by a system that is enslaving their voters with debt. They fail to see that fake news is simply a critique of the west by nations who are more traditional about how they exploit their people. There are the seeds of revolution within all this but at the moment most people would prefer to stick with debt. The economics of the West both left and right wing is such a farce you couldn’t make it up.",

His nineteenth-century analysis explains a lot about the world as we know it today.\nPeople are feeling that the world is going mad. Clashing sets of values and ideas causing anger and outrage. But no one seems to be able to make this situation intelligible. Most theories that try such as Critical Social Justice Theory (1) just make people confused and angry.\nBooks are published on topics as wide-ranging as of the climate crisis, overconsumption, the perils of affluence and the absence of love or community. These issues are all associated with the present state of the West and by implication the state of the whole world.\nA world of vastly different wealth and social and economic expectations will give rise to different ideas about what is wrong and what should be done.\nThe suggestions for solving the world’s vastly different problems all too often involve western people changing our lives, by for example eating less meat, being less stressed, buying less stuff, being more mindful of White privilege, more tolerant, less wealthy, critical of the past or just handing more power over to a state that likes to bully us with political correctness.\nThe question is, why with such a mountain of advice does nothing ever change? Why do we feel so much tension living in the early twenty-first century? Why is it always down to the western worker to change? What, if anything, has the western working class done wrong? Maybe we need to revisit Marx’s riddle of history and try to explain what has happened in the past, and what frightening prospects there might be for the West’s working people in the future unless they, -we- ‘get’ the riddle and avoid being either bullied or seduced by their elites who have adopted fashionable academic theories.\nIn simple terms, nothing changes dramatically because our consciousness changes far more slowly than the events that it must confront. It is largely fixed by our life experience. This is true of everyone in the world, from the tribal areas of Pakistan to the sandy beaches of Southern California. But it is not necessarily true of our ideologically driven elites who are committed to their own self-preservation by whatever means necessary.\nIn Classical Marxism, consciousness is what people think and importantly, why they think it. The tramlines of ‘normality’ which we carry about in our heads and which make us see certain things in certain ways. For Marxists, consciousness is determined by the nature of our economic circumstances and the level of scientific discovery upon which our attitudes are dependent.\nWhy do we, for example, accept women’s freedom and autonomy and some other cultures do not? Why do we value freedom of speech and other nations have blasphemy laws? Why do some people who newly arrive want to change western society so it better reflects their social expectations? What makes violence acceptable to some people to achieve ideological outcomes? It is all about consciousness, theirs, ours, yours, and mine and as significantly the collective consciousness of the people in charge of the structures that govern us, parliament, the law, councils, and courts etc. Let us decode this riddle properly.\nOur consciousness and where it comes from!\nOur economic system and society, plus now the internet and its vast wealth of information, create our thoughts and beliefs but give us no understanding of how that process happens. What makes us behave in the world the way we do? What makes us feel the way we do about the world or the society we inhabit?\nThe collective reality of billions of individual consciousnesses, navigating their world and jostling together is an unavoidable reality for humans, as we are, unlike other creatures, self-conscious animals.\nHumanity makes the world intelligible by creating frameworks for understanding it. We have come to call these, cultures, religions, and ideologies. They promote the benefits of their economic and social systems and protect its vested personal and economic interests, allocating power, and justifying one dominant idea over others. The aim of culture and religion historically is to make inequality intelligible and more importantly acceptable to people, be they citizens, subjects, voters, slaves, workers or whatever.\nTo make society function peoples’ acceptance is needed. In the absence of this, the elite must suppress people’s opposition by force. If the collective consciousness of people is at odds with what they have to accept as their reality, or the justification for their unfair treatment is weak, there will be trouble. Revolution in fact! Are we in such a period now?\nKarl Marx also observed that the history of humanity is the history of economic exploitation, how most people are taken advantage of, and how this is maintained. How does a minority, the elite, get to control the labour-power of the majority and the wealth that labour-power creates, make themselves rich and powerful and stay rich and powerful?\nThe process has involved an interesting cast of characters like Gods and prophets, warlords, books of revealed truths and more recently philosophers, and politicians. It all goes back thousands of years and has led to the promotion of ideas which make the people of the world think and behave in different ways. All to the same end though, to protect the rich by protecting their economic and social power structures. It is not a process linked to race, it is a process linked to class and status.\nThe need to understand the role of consciousness in this process only became relevant once humanity found a way to ‘make a modest profit’ initially on the back of slave labour. In traditional tribal communities, there was no wealth to control, so power structures were irrelevant.\nFor at least four thousand years the profit, created by workers or slaves, has fallen under the control of powerful personal or family interests. In short, the elites of every era.\nWe can look at different cultural influences to see what might inform different social and economic expectations. For example, Islam is an ideology that captures accurately the reality of the harsh seventh century Arab Peninsular. It is a world of warfare and submission to God with strict rules about society and sexual behaviour. The Qur’an (2) promotes this historical reality as the word of God. Today some followers of Islam attempt to introduce ‘God-given’ law by force. Whilst our elite might criticise their methods, and some academics identify cultural ‘disadvantage’, only working people will openly challenge the notion that these ‘laws’ come from God.\nAlternatively, Christianity said we need peace and love. For Jesus, there were enough economic resources going around for everyone to have a reasonable share. The loaves and fishes story illustrates this point (3). So, for Jesus, whilst reality was unfair, kings had more than slaves, he said we should stop thinking about having more for ourselves and think about others; ‘Love thy neighbour’ so to speak.\nThe willingness to ‘believe’ something like the Gospels or the Qur’an, something beyond our actual life experience is another essential component of human consciousness. We are the only animals who can ‘believe’ things which are absurdly not true. This is great news if you want to control people without force. What we believe and why we believe it is what gives us our unique, culturally specific consciousness and its various personal variations.\nWhat consciousness gets downloaded into our heads is complicated, but it is essentially a task for those who control society at any given time. That is until revolution forces change. Today with so much freedom and global communication, societies everywhere are a muddle with all sorts of ideas being promoted and accepted, even ones that are hostile to the concept of personal freedom itself.\nMaybe we no longer know what to believe, so anything goes. Maybe there is a consciousness being engineered to shift the world towards a global consensus. Agreement about what is right and wrong. Or maybe a sort of global consciousness is just emerging nudged by our global elites so that eventually everyone from the rural areas of Afghanistan to the coffee shops of New York will willingly accept it. Consciousness can and does change. Will it be good for western working people of all racial and other backgrounds though?\nSince biblical times economic changes have made people’s consciousness clash with new material realities. In the modern West, these changes have given rise to a freeing up of the rules that once forced us to accept overt control by others. Our modern western world of choices and freedoms allows each of us to create our own rules within the law and decide what we accept as normal. We create personalised ‘normality’. We have a fragmented collective consciousness that reflects our fragmented western world and our fragmented but free and generally tolerant society. But much of the world is not like us. It is not tolerant, or open-minded but why?\nBeing able to construct personal normality has not happened by accident. The economic reality of western society built up over hundreds of years makes it impossible for us not to have evolved our thinking the way we have.\nOur forebears could not have predicted the internet or aircraft travel two or three hundred years ago but how we have used these, is a result of the economic system they created, were all forced to accept, and then promoted as normal. For example, until the eighteenth century, we did not have the freedom to travel abroad. Part of their consciousness, a belief in freedom, became part of our consciousness. We, or more accurately our elites, have taken an eighteenth-century principle and woven it into our modern consciousness. Our elites have created our fragmented individualistic and personalised collective consciousness from what they and we have inherited. It is conceivable that our freedom is not a popular development everywhere in the world.\nIt is up to us to now understand how our individualism might go wrong. How our forbears’ house, once built on stone, has become our house built on the sand of western individualistic ‘normality’. Maybe there is pressure from a global elite to reverse this process. To create a new ‘normal’.\nOur foundations: The Wests Christian consciousness.\nReligion is ideology given the status of the divine or ‘God-given’. It was a trick common in the ancient world, that if you wanted your ideas to be taken seriously, you claimed they were from God and you were a prophet. Christianity went one step further claiming that Jesus was God. The message from first-century Jesus was “I bring you a revolutionary new message, love thy neighbour”. His disciples said, “copy the example set by Jesus in the Gospels”. Fairly simple stuff. Basically, be nice to each other.\nJesus was so out of step with the reality and collective consciousness of the ancient world, characterised by warfare and barbarism that within six centuries his ideas were replaced by more traditional ideas of warfare and submission to God as revealed by Muhammed in the Qur’an.\nBy the time Islam became the regions dominant ideology Christianity was pretty much pushed out of the Middle East and beyond. Christianity made its way to Europe, a wet, cold, and unappealing part of the world of little interest to Arab raiders. The Vikings, who knew the European territory, were responsible for Northern Europe’s seventh-century land grabs, in the name of their God Thor. That is until they converted to Christianity and the ideology of ‘love thy neighbour’ saw their distinct form of longboat barbarism slowly disappear.\nThis idea of love thy neighbour and the story of Jesus born of the Virgin Mary is the first step towards modern western consciousness. It represents the separation of the world of humanity from the world of God. Or in a modern take on the same theme, the separation of the world of human lives, from the world of human ideas.\nIn medieval Europe life was brutal, people suffered at the hands of aristocrats and kings, but the Christian Church ensured that there was always a distinction between humanity and God as represented by Jesus Christ. This separation of religion and the state became accepted as normal.\nThe Bible and Christianity did not combine the world of human conduct and the world of God into a single book of rules or laws. God could forgive even if humans could not. Jesus had died on the cross to forgive humanities sinfulness. This was a radical departure from earlier consciousness as prior to this an individual’s behaviour was laid down as a set of rules with punishments arising from failure to comply, all sanctioned by God. Stoning, for example, appears in both the Old Testament and in the Islamic Hadith. There is nothing like this in Christianity. Morality was more Gods business than humanities. God would sort out the unrepentant sinner in the afterlife.\nExtending this idea of the world of humanity being separate from the world of God, meant that in Christianity, the poor and the pious were willingly encouraged to accept their lot in life because they knew their impoverished earthy life would secure them a place in heaven if they ‘loved their neighbour as themselves’. As the Christian Hymn has it ‘the rich man in his castle the poor man at his gate, God made them high and lowly, and ordered their estate’. Christianity laid the foundation for accepting things as they are. Uncomplainingly, peacefully and with a view to your love for others seeing you enter the kingdom of heaven.\nThis belief in the normality of poverty, the forgiveness of sin, and acceptance of the power of others, based on their use of practices like coercion, and compulsion, defined European consciousness for hundreds of years. Indeed control, coercion and compulsion are, as we will see, the default position for all elites who are not forced to accept freedom as a basic right for everyone.\nBack in Medieval Europe whilst on earth everyone was unequal, by showing love to others, even the rich, you would gain equality with them in heaven. This belief endured for centuries until the Church itself departed from Christian doctrine. The Church failed to follow the word of God.\nThe Christian Church in the form of Catholicism failed to reflect the basic biblical requirement to ‘love thy neighbour’. The Church became bloated, bureaucratic, and self-serving. It was increasingly seen as incapable of extending the love of God to anyone. It became a reflection of earthly power, status, and wealth. The corruptible world of humanity replaced that of love thy neighbour.\nRather than simply tolerate poverty the Church began to create poverty by taking wealth from ordinary people using compulsion and coercion. By doing this the Church departed from the message of the Gospels and gained many critics.\nAn emerging revolutionary Christian elite began creating a new consciousness, and in doing so challenged coercion and compulsion eventually creating consent-based choice or ‘freedom’. This better reflected emerging economic and social reality.\nFreedom would eventually lead to freedom of speech and would allow people to abandon the Catholic Church, create different types of Christianity, and succeed in the world unimpeded by a greedy church or state. Christianity had served the feudal state well by making poverty acceptable to rich and poor alike. But times were changing driven by new economic realities.\nWith an unwillingness to accept centuries of personal poverty as normal, this Christian revolutionary class started to gain strength from the sixteenth century onwards. Over time it changed the consciousness of the political elite, emerging the victorious class by routing feudalism at the end of the seventeenth century. These revolutionaries were called the Bourgeoisie. They created the principles of contract, choice, consent, freedom, and democracy which now form a major part of our modern western consciousness. These principles were known as bourgeois principles.\nWith these principles, the bourgeoisie created capitalism and built a political and legal system supporting their new revolutionary view of consent-based personal choice and freedom.\nTheir new consciousness over time became our consciousness, whether we know it or not, or liked it or not. We value the freedom and consent-based choice they created, which some other ‘rule-based’ cultures do not recognise as legitimate. Our consciousness based on freedom ‘buffers’ with rule-based consciousnesses. Even today political correctness and wokeness challenge concepts of freedom (4). Both are part of a new rule-based ideology, that is attempting to return us to a world of coercion and compulsion in thought, language, and behaviour.\nThe eighteenth-century development of western consciousness founded on consent-based choice or freedom has been unique, formed as it was in a furnace of economic change. Capitalism required freedom in a way that feudalism or slave societies did not. Principles like contract, choice and consent were legal principles underpinning freedom and were ruthlessly defended in the criminal courts of early capitalism. Of course, freedom was not welcomed by everyone. There would be numerous push backs.\nThe feudal system might have kept you powerless and poor, coerced and compelled but the church would give you food or alms and tell you that you would be guaranteed a place in heaven because of your poverty or if you repented of your sins.\nCapitalism created poverty too if you were unable to use your freedom to get rich unlike feudalism, it was happy to let you starve. Alternatively, it would execute you if you stole the private property of others. It was OK to contract for something, but to take it without consent was a capital offence. The courts put on trial thousands of petty thieves who were then executed. Transportation to Australia and the workhouse eventually became the capitalist systems way of treating criminals ‘humanely’.\nEventually the English church by now no longer Roman Catholic, thanks to Henry the Eighth, stopped supporting the poor. Slowly the state stopped using coercion, control and compulsion and embraced a brutal new reality; freedom backed by Protestantism, and all based on contract, choice, and consent. The Protestant work ethic was born.\nPeople were free to become rich and in doing so acquire power, status and influence, but they were also free to starve, to be exploited by capitalists (5) and to experience a hard life of misery and ignorance whilst other people, the bourgeoisie or capitalists got rich.\nGet rich without adopting capitalist principles and it was the hangman’s noose or the debtor’s prison. This early capitalist system was brutal. No wonder people came to hate it so much, people like Lenin (6) and Trotsky (7) who were Russian revolutionaries in the early twentieth century.\nCapitalisms eighteenth and nineteenth-century history remain the benchmark by which the western world’s traditional left-wing view capitalism, even in the twenty-first century. But most on the traditional left, and those who adopt Critical Social Justice Theories have a very crude understanding of capitalism and overlook the fact that like many ideologies, including socialism, it had its good points, like contract, choice, and consent as well as its bad points like continuing to promote status, inequality, and unfairness.\nOf course, whilst contract, choice and consent were getting established as principles underpinning capitalist freedom and democracy for the elite, the old principles of earthly power based on coercion, control and compulsion had not gone away completely. In fact, the economy of the eighteenth century was a confusing mixture of both feudal and capitalist principles with the ‘theory’ of freedom coexisting with the ‘reality’ of compulsion based on the need to avoid starvation.\nIt depended on your social position, as to how much contract, choice and consent or freedom you could enjoy and how much control, compulsion, and coercion you could avoid. Initially, the capitalist class was seen by the poor as worse than the old feudal barons, they at least had provided land to be worked and poverty was a virtue.\nIt has taken centuries for the consciousness of the working people to uncritically accept contract choice and consent. This is because the worker’s economic situation made it impossible for them to exercise what were their legal rights. What made early capitalism so brutal was working people were forced by poverty to ‘freely’ choose coercion and control on pain of starvation for themselves and their families.\nImagine the anger a situation like that would cause. It is this anger that marks the next great stride in our western consciousness. We started to reject the idea that contract, choice, and consent should be used by a greedy economic and political elite to trap us into accepting coercion and control.\nIn Summary\nFor thousands of years, humanity accepted violence and barbarism as a way of life. This violent activity was part of our consciousness, it was tolerated as ‘normal’. In the first century, Christianity adopted a revolutionary way of thinking, ‘love thy neighbour’. This idea was eventually superseded by the re-establishment of more traditional behaviours typical of the area and era such as holy war and rule-based submission to God.\nChristianity moved into Europe and began promoting the idea that we accept our lot in life peacefully, and uncomplainingly, as Jesus had when he died on the cross. This idea of being passive and accepting coercion and compulsion lasted until the church became hungry for power. A new set of economic opportunities and legal principles emerged, contract, choice, and consent. These created the concept of freedom available to an elite and eventually, it gave rise to democracy.\nCapitalisms freedom was brutal. Freedom to starve and if you disobeyed the rules by ignoring contract, choice, and consent and for example stole, the early capitalist state would hang you with little mercy.\nMaking Capitalist values the new normal: A consciousness being born!\nWith the old ways of compulsion, coercion and control being slowly superseded by an implacable application of contract choice and consent, the world was in for a turbulent two hundred years or so. Capitalists, who acquired the power of money, became just like their feudal predecessors, rich and obsessed with status, sitting on top of a political system which looked after their economic interests. They even found ways to rig the anarchy of the capitalist system so they could ape the lifestyle of the old aristocrats. This was the world of monopolies, mergers, and super-profits.\nThe churches stopped assisting the poor emphasising the virtue of hard work, not poverty. A new world was emerging and with it, a new consciousness was being formed. The anarchic early capitalist world of traders and merchants settled down to a new order of inherited privilege, status, unfairness, and inequality. All based on legal principles of choice and consent.\nThe population in the early capitalist world fell into two camps. Those who saw freedom based on contract, choice, and consent as capitalisms most valuable contribution to human life. These people then and now tend to see economic failure as a personal problem caused by fecklessness. Alternatively, there were others who saw contract, choice, and consent simply as ‘bourgeois values’, a way of bullying vulnerable workers into accepting low wages, poor conditions and poverty to make someone else rich under the pretence of ‘freedom’ and liberty.\nThese conflicting views have shaped different forms of consciousness in different parts of the western world. All claim to desire freedom based on consent-based choice but with different levels of control applied by the state, depending on how successfully ‘freedom’ is seen to be making individuals rich.\nBritain was the first properly capitalist country. By the mid-eighteenth century, capitalism was augmented by industrialisation to make Britain powerful enough to create an empire and extend capitalism via trade to much of the world.\nBritain was so wealthy the idea of capitalism needing to use feudal and barbaric principles of compulsion, control and coercion in its economic affairs was challenged, and rightly so. As a result, politicians and thinkers came to argue for constraints upon capitalists, holding them hard to bourgeois principles of contract, choice, and consent. Thus, slavery was challenged and eventually Britain abolished it.\nBritain has helped to confine that disgusting practise to the dustbin of history, at least in the western world. Slavery still prospers as it always has done in countries that allow the powerful to ‘own’ people using control, coercion and compulsion and then steal their labour power for self-enrichment. Labour power rightly belongs to the slave. In capitalism, it is not stolen but ‘contracted’ with ‘consent’ to an employer in exchange for a wage. This is accepted as fair in a free society.\nThe extent of contract, choice and consent being ‘believed in’ among the general population determine a nations political maturity, compared with ongoing belief in earlier power structures like authoritarianism and feudalism. The larger the group who could enjoy freedom based on these principles the freer and more liberated a country could claim to be. The counterpoint, however, is the society would probably remain just as unfair, elitist, and unequal Thus there is a tension between freedom being valued and freedom being challenged.\nBecause early capitalism generally improved the lives of most people, elitism, status, and unfairness eventually became accepted by most. Under mature capitalism, the views of all but the most hardened revolutionary would be, “using freedom based on contract, choice and consent, I too could become rich and have status, be part of an elite and accept unfairness as ‘normal’.\nThis is the world today and it is unravelling before our eyes because the system that underpins it, capitalism is now in trouble. To make capitalism work we now must use personal and national debt, not ‘capital’ (8) as Marx would have understood it.\nCapitalism in crisis is challenging us all to find solutions, it is shaking our confidence in our political and economic system and is reshaping our consciousness. It is possible to detect a trend against personal freedom because freedom is again being blamed for inequality, elitism, and unfairness. The advance of political correctness and wokeness are the ideas at the forefront of this attempt to return to compulsion and coercion to ‘prevent’ economic inequality and unfairness. But as always it will be at the expense of personal freedom.\nApart from a small but growing band of politically correct or woke activists, most westerners now believe in bourgeois values. They associated them with personal success and freedom. In the past, there was a good chance that anyone could achieve some personal success within the capitalist system. Our great grandparents and great, great, grandparents would have measured their success in terms of material comfort, the quality of family life, and the positions they held in the community. They would have accepted that there were ‘their betters’ and that even though life was typically unfair and unequal, they all had a fighting chance to make a good life.\nThe Elitism, inequality, and unfairness inherent within capitalism would have been part of their collective consciousness, but it would have been viewed as the price worth paying for living in a free society. Capitalism is unique in that people consent to their inequality. It is a trade-off.\nBy the nineteen fifties Britain was becoming a nation of individuals defined by a belief in good principles of contract choice and consent and bad but generally tolerated principles of elitism, inequality, and unfairness. It is important to grasp that bourgeois society accepts these six basic ideas in their totality. For Marxists, it is important to emphasise that the purpose of revolution should be to preserve the first three and minimise the impact of the latter three. That is what Marxism promotes. But why has ‘Marxism’ not delivered this reality?\nBy the heyday of western bourgeois values in the nineteen fifties Russia and China’s ‘communist’ revolutions had come and gone and the life of the Russian and Chinese worker was worse than that of the employee in a ‘free’ nation like the United Kingdom or the United States.\nThe problem for the Russians and Chinese people was that unlike their eighteenth-century Western European and United States counterparts, their twentieth-century bourgeoisie like Lenin, Trotsky, and Mao, the leaders of the Russian and Chinese revolutions, had decided that capitalism was a no go area, and so they supported state-controlled industrialisation, without the need to establish freedom through a bourgeois revolution based contract, choice and consent.\nRussia and China rejected capitalism. The political elite did not like the way consent and choice-based freedom had caused poverty in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Who can blame them? Whilst history might judge them as wrong, maybe it was not so mad to try and avoid capitalism if you had seen it in action in the nineteenth-century West, as both Lenin and Trotsky had done. Cruel conditions, low wages, no healthcare, no education for workers, whilst an exploiting bourgeoisie swanned around Europe on the Grand Tour (9).\nBy avoiding choice and consent-based capitalism however, Russia and China oppressed their people, denying them political freedom but guaranteeing them employment in state factories or farms. A gulf eventually developed called the Iron Curtain. After World War Two the world was divided between the free world, the West, and the totalitarian single-party regimes of Russia and China.\nUnsurprisingly the West came to associate Marxism with the Russian Revolution and therefore cruel oppression.\nIt was wrongly claimed that Marxism was the same as Leninism or Maoism. The result allowed western capitalists and politicians to persuade western workers that Marxism was a bad idea and would, just like in Russia or China, take away their freedom as Lenin and Mao had done. Such hostile views preserved the West’s unfair and elitist political and economic system and resulted in status, unfairness, and inequality going unchallenged, particularly in the United States. It reinforced in the consciousness of western workers that only capitalism guaranteed freedom. ‘Marxism’ which had analysed both the good and bad in capitalism, as we have done, was tyrannical because Russia and China were.\nIn Britain, there had been a socialist revolution of sorts after World War Two. Whilst extending the principles of contract, choice and consent to more and more workers, the post-war Labour government also started to end elitism, inequality and unfairness by setting up a Welfare State and providing access to the establishment for working-class children via Grammar schools.\nHealth care, welfare and pensions became available paid by National Insurance. This Labour government made Britain a democratic or ‘free’ socialist country. A country reflecting Marxist principles. The Labour Government too ashamed to admit that their socialism was influenced by Marxism, claimed British socialism was based on Methodist Christianity. Love thy neighbour!\nWhatever the Labour Party claimed, it still did much of what Marx and Engels had urged in their Communist Party ‘Manifesto’ (10) The post-war Labour government attempted to minimise the three bad aspects of capitalism, namely status, unfairness and elitism and extend to more people the good principles of capitalism namely contract, choice, and consent. And it worked until tragedy struck in the nineteen seventies and the bad bourgeois values began to be accepted and embraced by working people and their powerful industrial unions, and again consciousness played a part in this.\nIn Britain, the mature post-war mixed economy of capitalism with democratic socialism was the victim of its own success. It spread its ideology, principles and values creating a society and economy that was as near ‘socialist’ as possible whilst still being capitalist and underpinned by freedom. Sadly, however elitism, status and unfairness are like an infectious disease. Empowered industrial workers in nationalised industries began to focus increasingly on the opportunities to demand preferential treatment and create for themselves a better life than that of other workers. The upshot was that by the nineteen eighties the working class was divided by race, class, industrial-strength, status, and ideology. The last thing needed in the fight against unfairness, inequality, and elitism.\nFar from seeing working people as one powerless mass who should all benefit from state provision and increased democracy, these workers wanted to outdo other workers financially. They turned on the government and taxpayers demanding higher and higher wages. These workers had enjoyed the principles of contract, choice and consent and were now up for a bit of industrial elitism, status, and unfairness. This was the birth of the twentieth-century bourgeois socialist. No surprise their early leaders were called Trades Union barons. More latterly this ideology along with political correctness and wokeness has infected the ‘Left’ who no longer recognise what disadvantage really is or what needs to change to politically empower all working people irrespective of their ‘identity’. So-called Critical Social Justice Theory has only achieved further differentiation of the mass of working people.\nBy the late nineteen eighties individuals began pursuing their own self- interest using contract, choice, and consent in pursuit of elitism for themselves whilst becoming casual about unfairness to others. This became almost a ‘New Labour’ by-line! The bourgeois values that post-war socialism had attempted to minimise, were now driving the personal greed of the so-called free market. The fabric of society was straining as collective values disappeared or became matters of personal choice and political self-interest.\nIn America, a similar process was going on. Labour was getting the edge over ‘capital’. Bourgeois values of self-interest and elitism were undermining any attempt to bring solidarity to working people. Punishment and therefore prison building was the reaction of the American bourgeoisie to any challenge to the American dream or the idea of the land of the free. Socialism or any suggestion of it could destroy careers. Even with a declining industrial base and widespread poverty, America’s collective consciousness remained implacably elitist, unfair, and unequal and for most of the population proudly so.\nHowever, change may be afoot. America the United Kingdom and Europe may be forced to change, as younger voters are becoming concerned about climate change and structural inequality, albeit with a slightly muddled idea about what Social Justice should look like. This may trigger the inevitable shift in America’s collective consciousness. America is not ready for revolution, but it desperately needs something resembling British or European socialism.\nWith capitalism failing and falling into debt the worlds working people will have to pick up the bill. We will inevitably have to develop a new collective consciousness that rids the world of elitism, unfairness, and inequality, whilst striving to extend contract, choice, and consent to countries with a tradition of rule-based coercion and control. But this has massive implications for the western world’s eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century institutions which were not set up to empower ordinary people, just a bourgeois elite.\nThe bourgeois elite now mainly holed up in the arts, media, politics, and the public and civil services will eventually have to tackle a major social and economic problem which according to Marxists is an inevitability.\nWhat do you do when workers are happy to contract, choose and consent but are increasingly unwilling to accept the structural problems associated with elitism, unfairness, and inequality?\nWorking people’s consciousness is beginning to see elitism, inequality, and unfairness as major social problems, which discriminate against all those who are in the middle and at the bottom of the social and economic pile irrespective of their sexual or racial identity.\nThe populism evident in Europe, the vote to leave the European Union, the increasing number of people turning off the British Broadcasting Corporation or refusing to fund it via a licence fee, the rejection of ‘top pay’ for public sector workers in the United Kingdom. And in the United States a violent rejection of bourgeois power structures, all reflect the public’s growing belief that their money is paying for ‘fat cats’ and inequality. Financing with debt a remote elite who by their very existence promotes inequality and disadvantage.\nThe reaction of the global political and economic elite to this new awakening of workers consciousness is predictable. They use their remaining political, and economic clout to create and amplify minor differences within the mass class of working people. They finance Critical Social Justice academics and institutions that promote the idea that there are numerous disadvantaged powerless others. This has created a violent ‘Left-Wing’ groupthink based on the idea that there are numerous victim groups suffering injustice and disadvantage who need empowering, rather than one working-class experiencing mass class disadvantage.\nThis is wokeness. In its demand for political empowerment, it seeks to return us to a society of coercion and compulsion using the language of disadvantage, ‘inclusion’ and injustice. Maybe unintentionally it protects the global elite by taking the emphasis off class consciousness, creating fractious global ‘victims’ continuously at war with each other and their state. Its all good for global business and fuels the need for state control and state spending on ‘security’.\nThe more of these disadvantaged ‘others’ you create, the less likely that anyone single group of workers will be large enough to demand the dismantling of elitism and unfairness within the worlds political and economic system. Elitism and unfairness from which politicians and the economic elite benefit, whether it is in Europe or the Kingdoms of the Middle East, Russia, or China.\nThe aim of social progress should be to extend to all workers contract, choice, and consent to the point where it is so widespread and well understood that inequality, elitism, and unfairness is seriously tackled and replaced by cooperation, collaboration, and consensus.\nThe problem with any attempt to stifle social progress and prevent the expected reduction in elitism, unfairness and inequality is that people from all groups experience the world in the middle and at the bottom of society in very much the same way. So, whilst the activist is trying to create ‘awareness’ of ‘injustice’ by being ‘woke’ on behalf of one group or another, what they are really doing is creating division and differentiation.\nFar from tackling ‘structural inequality’ structural inequality is being promoted. This is done by forcing working people to see a world of political or economic disadvantage that is not linked to class but to ‘identity’. Indeed, the white working class is often presented as oppressive to other equally oppressed or marginalised groups. How did we end up with so much confusion?\nMaybe the consciousness of the politician, journalist, mainstream media news anchor, or the artist, actor, or celebrity is defined by their personal status, their elitism, and their lack of equality with the rest of us. It defines their lives and differentiates them from us. They do not have a consciousness that wants to eradicate unfairness, and inequality, they have a consciousness that is guilty about the existence of these things, but they are not capable of recognising in themselves that their privilege contributes to privilege or injustice overall. They blame racism, transphobia, western history, or right-wing governments. They do not recognise that racism, for example, is just one manifestation of the structural disadvantage of which they are themselves, torchbearers.\nThey, the bourgeois elite, are simply the poets and apologists for all so-called oppressed groups. They are not the undertakers of elitism and inequality; they are its most ardent practitioners. They are never going to change class disadvantage because they are the guilty, but willing beneficiaries of it. This is the riddle of history if not solved at least explained. Critical Social Justice Theory and Wokeness is the fog that allows the mechanism for injustice to continue. A mechanism, largely hidden from view by the politics of identity.\nConclusion\nThe revolutionary principles created by capitalism fall into two groups. In the good group are Contract, Choice, and Consent. Of course, it has taken years for many ordinary people to be able to use these principles and in some communities, for example, religious communities, women, and gay people still cannot use them. These principles underpin our freedom and democracy. In the bad corner, we have the leftovers of the feudal system elitism, status, and inequality. These are the bits of the old system that the rich and powerful nineteenth-century and twentieth-century capitalists wanted to keep. It ensured their position and more importantly our position as workers too.\nElitism and unfairness are increasingly unlikely to be promoted among ordinary working people. However, they are all too common among a privileged now largely a Left-Wing class of political activists, politicians and opinion formers who are reluctant to undermine their own class privilege, which is based on maintaining structural political and economic inequality.\nBecause bourgeois systems and structures use the currency of power to impose change and policy from the top, unless these elites are forced by ordinary workers to reform, they will not.\nWithout being forced to change the political or economic system will never get to the point where it realises that elitism, unfairness, and inequality confers no legitimate power and should be replaced by co-operation, collaboration, and consensus. That is, or at least should be a future we should all fight for. That is the riddle of history if not yet fully solved at least explained.\nTo show solidarity with the concept of Blue Revolution and our twenty-first-century reinterpretation of Classical Marxism try and raise your own consciousness above the economic and political world view of your childhood inheritance, what you as you grew up will have been told is ‘just the way it is’.\nThink about whether you really need to work harder just for more money? What is the cost to your lifestyle and your health and wellbeing? Think the importance of status yours and others. How much does your status preoccupy you? Should status or celebrity important? How important should having power be? Could you imagine a world where all people have similar amounts of power? Have you ever knowingly acted unjustly towards someone to get power over them? Did you feel justified doing it? If so why? how much do you genuinely care about other people’s welfare? People, who have deep-seated problems? Is their inequality something to be accepted? Do you think the current political system gives you a real voice? Does the current political system listen? Do you trust the political system? Is it ‘democratic’ If you do, why? These questions can only be answered by you, but your answers will give a clue to the state of your consciousness.\nThink about and talk about consciousness. How we are all, what we think, and how it makes our expectations in life difficult to change. If we see and benefit from elitism, inequality, and unfairness as the political and economic elite do, we will almost certainly find ways of using contract, choice, and consent to preserve them. Until that is the elite find ways of getting us to accept unfairness and inequality using the language of inclusion to impose control, coercion, and compulsion upon the mass of ordinary people.\nExercise\nElitism, unfairness, and inequality is called Structural inequality. How it works and why governments will never ‘level up’.\nA group of twenty people are in a room. They are mixed backgrounds selected randomly. They are all told to mingle and meet people with whom they might have something in common. They are then asked to form four groups of five people and then form four lines of five one line behind the other. Understandably the groups tend to form along sex and racial and other identity lines but not exclusively. Some groups are more mixed than others. Each person is given a piece of paper and is asked to scrunch it up into a ball. A plastic bin is put in front of the first row and they are told that to secure a £10,000 prize thy must get the paper in the bin. If they move away from where they are in the row, before the end of the exercise, they will lose the £10,000 and will have to swap places with someone else. They will also have to throw again from their new position. So, in theory, they could swap with someone at the back. All the front row get the paper in the bin. The whole row collects fifty thousand pounds in total. The next row back are told they have the same opportunity to get the paper in the bin and win the £10,000. The people in row two can see they have to overcome the people already in the front row. Only those in the middle nearest the bin or are tall enough to drop the paper over the heads of those on the front are successful. This row nets £20,000\nThe next group has the same opportunity, to throw the paper ball, and secure a personal reward of £10,000 but again must throw the paper over the heads of the two front groups as well as get it into a bin they cannot see. The front group being guilty but rich to the tune of £10,000 each, try and help by pointing to where the bin is located. They will not move away from the ‘top slot’ themselves. This is a guilty conscience, helping but really achieving nothing.\nThe third group and those at the back fail to get any paper in the bin. Some people at the front say the reason they failed was not that the rows in front did not try and help but because the people at the back were disadvantaged, in some other way. Some people at the back are accused of disadvantaging other people at the back by jostling them etc. One person at the back in a wheelchair is advised that this is the reason that she failed. The rest of her row is blamed by those at the front.\nDo you think it is Ok to have a guilty conscience like the people at the front and talk about helping people at the back with their disadvantage, but being unprepared to do anything meaningful about it because their consciousness simply makes it OK to accept wealth associated with inequality? They accept elitism, inequality, and unfairness because it benefits them personally.\nThis is the difference between a guilty conscience and a raised consciousness. Only the people at the back have the raised consciousness. They can see what is really going on! They have nothing to lose by speaking the truth or sharing what they have. In life in general who would you say is at the back and who at the front? Can you think of other fairer rules for the same game?\nThe Riddle of History Solved- a summary\nHistorical era Consciousness framed b Social outcome\nTribal society coercion, compulsion, and control Collaboration, cooperation, and consensus\nAuthoritarian/Feudalism coercion, compulsion, and control Elitism, inequality, and unfairness\nSingle Party Authoritarian coercion, compulsion, and control Elitism, inequality, and unfairness\nCapitalism contract, choice and consent Elitism, inequality, and unfairness\nPost Capitalism contract, choice and consent Collaboration, cooperation, and consensus\nOr woke intolerance coercion, compulsion, and control Elitism, inequality unfairness\n- Critical Social Justice is a collection of ‘theories’ that promote identity as the only basis for disadvantage.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_wokeness-decoded/content_147.html": "Wokery decoded\nDe Coding Wokeness; A Simple Guide.\nWe hear a lot about the woke. But what is it to be woke? To understand wokeness it is necessary to understand a couple of theories one going back to the 1950s called postmodernism an oversimplification of Marxist consciousness and the other a more recent corruption of postmodernism which is called Critical Social Justice Theory. Both focus on feelings and identities.\nIn the 1950’s it became fashionable to stop looking at social concepts as fixed and to start seeing concepts like marriage, or gender, as fluid. Things were capable of being defined in a non-prescriptive way by different people. So, for example, ‘femininity’ was once a definition which had accepted social characteristics. It would have defined how a person dresses, modifies their looks, maybe speaks and how they relate to other people. The idea that post modernists developed said that just because you were biologically ‘female’ you did not have to look or behave or have your attitudes shaped by what ‘western’ society said was feminine. This seems reasonable, ask any tomboy!\nThe feminists who argued this had in mind a world where your biology should not define what femininity looked like. So, they were pushing against social ‘norms’ that defined ‘femininity’. Back in the 1950s femininity was for example not smoking a pipe or wearing a three-piece suit or being powerful in business. Femininity was back in the 1940s and 1950’s the opposite of these ‘masculine’ identities. This became the foothills of wokeness. The early ‘awakening’ that what was ‘real’ like ‘femininity’ or ‘masculinity’ might just be a ‘social construction’ and therefore capable of being changed, becoming ‘fluid’.\nWhat these early and innocent pioneers who were called postmodernists did not say was that if you identified as ‘feminine’ you became ‘female’. Their views were influenced by feminists, so they would have rejected any idea that by identifying as something other than you were, you became that something you identified with.\nFor example, within the range of ‘masculinities’, it is backed up by research that some white boys identify with black street culture and therefore adopt what is seen ‘on the streets’ as a black identity. But it does not make them black. They are white boys identifying as black for reasons of identity. They know that too.\nHowever, in full-blown ‘woke’ ideology, within certain groups (which incidentally does not include white boys), you can become that with which you identify. This is no more clearly evidenced than in trans radicalism. If we go back to the 1940s and 1950s with the largely French intellectuals who created postmodernism, a female was a biological reality, not a social ‘identity’. The social identity was ‘feminine’. So, for them, a biological female could dress like a man, swear like a man, have sex like a man and bear no resemblance to the ‘social identity’ ‘feminine’. She might choose to adopt every ‘masculine’ characteristic imaginable like fighting, but she was a female and biologically different from males. This is the misunderstanding the ‘woke’ either do not understand or ignore. They believe that it is possible to ‘change sex’. You cannot change your sex, but you can change your sexual identity.\nAs a result of the ignorance or misunderstanding of lawmakers, it is now possible to change your sex on your birth certificate. This is wrong. There should be a box added to the birth certificate that allows you at the age of 18+ to re-identify other than as your birth sex.\nSo, what does this mean when dealing with woke people. Very simply it means that a trans man, is one form of identity within the biological sex ‘female’ and a trans woman is one form of identity within the biological sex male. For males, you might argue that at one extreme there is ‘toxic’ masculinity e.g. a belief, often seen in some religious groups, that men are powerful and must be obeyed by women, and at the other end there are males who identify as females. But they are not females they are an extreme form of male identity that rejects ‘masculinity’ as an identity of choice. Anyone who tries to argue against these facts…..is called a transphobe.\nMoving on from confusion over transexual identities the critical social justice ideology or wokeness has done a similar exercise with the colour of people’s skin. So, this time whilst there is no doubting one’s skin colour, the ‘identity’ associated with that skin colour is defined. Black people are ‘defined’ as victims of ‘structural disadvantage’ and white people are defined as the ‘oppressors’. This ignores that in capitalist and post-capitalist society there are victims of structural disadvantage who are white and millionaire successes who are black. Class and status is a far better determinant of success and failure than skin colour. A person’s class is defined by their ability to accumulate capital or get access to capital, even if that capital is in the form of taxation paid to people as high public sector wages.\nSo structural disadvantage isn’t about poor white people keeping black people down but white upper-middle-class people who decide the social and economic rules (senior politicians, civil servants, Charity and BBC executives etc) but they pretend it is ‘nothing to do with us, guvnor’. Anyone applying for a job in the public sector knows how ‘the right candidate’ must have, if not a ‘middle class’ background, learnt middle-class skills with verbal and nonverbal reasoning, and knowledge of psychometric tests etc being demonstrated irrespective of skin colour.\nThat is why there are probably proportionally more people who are black in the ‘structurally disadvantaged class, but it is not because they are black its because they are poor and have little access to capital accumulation or the ability to acquire the ‘right’ kind of learnt skills. They have not been allowed to progress by a middle class elitist system that pretends its fair to all, whilst then blaming poor white people for the failure of some black people.\nSo, the real reason there are disadvantaged black people and white people is that there really is ‘structural disadvantage’ and it is getting worse. But it is not racial it is class-based and more and more people will eventually fall into the disadvantaged category. Only then will the scales on the eyes of indebted students and the politically angry white middle class, finally lift as they will see who the real enemies of poor black and white people are. The elitist system that gate keeps entry only to those with the knowledge to get in and shuts everyone ese out. In other words, poorer disadvantaged people of whatever colour.\nFinally, we need to explore the woke obsession with Islam and the baffling protection of it from justified critique. This is baffling paradox seems to be the result of the woke misunderstanding both the nature of Islam and the real role of western thinking in liberating people from rule-based religious dogma.\nIslam is an ideology based on the application of strict rules which either ban things or allow things. These rules were revealed to Mohammed as the word of God in the 7th century by the Angel Gabriel. Gabriel was the Angel who also foretold the birth of Jesus who whilst not the word of God, was the Son of God, born six hundred years before Mohammed. The Prophet Mohammed had views which were very typical of the 7th century Arab Peninsular and elsewhere in the Middle East. He believed women were inferior to men, worth financially half as much as men in fact. He also believed in waging war against non-Muslims to provide booty for the cause of Islam. There are other ‘characteristics’ often levelled as criticisms of Islam such as child marriage, but in fairness, these were just typical of the 7th century almost everywhere.\nSo, Islam is about strict do and don’ts. The woke do seem conflicted about do’s and don’ts. They like their do’s, hating western history for example, but get angry if they are told to accept others do’s like for example having the freedom to speak your mind. How they would feel about Islam is something one can only speculate about. The problem for the woke is that in their muddled critical social justice theorising, they focus on bashing western freedom, seeing it solely as the cause of disadvantage for non-white people. However too many of their preferred identities clash irreconcilable but abhorring freedom of speech, nothing is ever said. So, for example, traditional Islam and feminism clash, feminism, and trans-activism clash and trans activism and lesbian and Gay rights clash and Lesbianism and Gay rights clash with traditional Islam.\nThe woke really do not know what the historical and scientific reality is behind what they believe or maybe what the implications are for what they believe in terms of freedom. This is because the woke are simply obsessed with the superficiality of social identities defined for minorities by them and their social justice mentors. So maybe like people who see identity as personal rather than sociological, we should just stop paying them any attention.",

What feelings is the word intended to invoke? Well, that depends on who is saying ‘Islam’. In this brief paper by one of the founder six members of the group Blue Revolution, we are going to examine Islam from two perspectives and use as the basis for our examination the concept of consciousness which Blue Revolution believe is the best way of understanding the tensions which exist between those who embrace Islam hand those who don’t.\nIslam originated in the tribal areas of the seventh century Arab Peninsular when Mohammed the Prophet of Islam received the ‘word of God’, revealed to him by the Angel Gabriel. Gabriel had made an appearance some six hundred years earlier when he foretold of the Birth of Jesus who it was claimed by Christians was the son of God. The role of Gabriel gives these religions what we call their ‘Divine Narrative’. Divine Narrative is ‘evidence’ that what we are told is not simply a reflection of the life of Jesus the man or the Quran are thoughts of Mohammed another man, but they are both related to God. It was common in the period of antiquity to use such grand claims to make people accept things they might otherwise choose to reject. Plato the Greek Philosopher used such a grand claim he called a ‘Noble Lie’ to justify the rule of philosopher Kings over the masses.\nIslam has two core elements the Quran, the word of God revealed to Mohammed, and the Hadith. The Hadith is as important to most Muslims as the Quran, but the Hadith is a series of narrations by different people who claim to have known Mohammed. These narrations are not claimed to be related to God like the Quran.\nSo, in the Hadith, there are numerous references to Mohammed such as “I saw the prophet do this” or “I heard the prophet say that”. It is in the Hadith that one can read a lot about seventh-century tribal reality. How people had sex, what if any obligations one has to non-believers and how women are to be treated or indeed trained in the way of Islam. It is in the Hadith that stoning for adulterous behaviour is referenced. The punishment in the Quran for adultery is a modest one hundred lashes. However, It is fairly clear from both Quran and Hadith that adultery is to be punished with serious physical harm, that homosexuality is an abomination and that Islam is at constant war, a sort of holy tribal war, to vanquish all other cultures and impose on humanity the doctrines of.\nIslam is monotheistic, there is only one God Allah. The doctrine which supports this belief is called Tawhid. Tawhid is the concept of one perfect God and also reflects within this belief the unity of human behaviour with the word of God if people obey the Quran. It is clear why this is a challenge. The Quran does not easily fit in with the expectations of 21st Century people. Tawhid reflects the unity of God and humanity, as long as you do as God or Mohammed says.\nIf one could achieve Tawhid, argue some Islamic scholars one would create a “Heaven on Earth”, the perfect community an Islamic community. This desire to achieve unity between God and humanity via religious observance is what influences the consciousness of ISIS and other Islamist groups. The belief that applying Quranic law and Mohammed’s examples of social behaviour described in the Hadith leads to Heaven on Earth. The problem is, this Heaven on Earth requires women to accept God-given deficiency in ‘faith and intellect’ and Homosexuals to accept being killed as punishment for their ‘sin’. The overarching problem is therefore that everyone must submit to the same ‘idea’ of ‘The Word of God’ and interpretations of the numerous Hadith. A big ask even in Islam as no single doctrine exists in Islam which is accepted by all Muslims.\nTherefore the descriptions of the seventh century captured in the Quran and Hadith become the basis for disagreement among scholars and of course any male can revert to the argument that the Quran must be taken literally if confronted with revisionism or ‘liberal interpretations’. After all the Quran is Gods word.\nSo far nothing remotely controversial has been said. Many Muslims would agree with some or all of what has been referred to above. Maybe some might challenge us on Gabriel’s first-century assertion that Jesus was the Son of God (rather than just another prophet) who preceded Mohammed.\nThe main challenge for Islamic Scholars is to persuade us in the 21st-century that the vision of social and economic perfection based on the Quran and Hadith, can improve human existence. They also need to explain why women should accept as a sex their deficiency. or Homosexuals should accept being punished in the name of God.\nIslam is only perfect in theory. No one has ever made Islam perfect in reality. Notwithstanding this, Islam is the perfect ideology with which to attack others for being ‘different’ and therefore ungodly. It is hard to imagine gaining many followers if Islam’s expectations about human behaviour are so unrepresentative of people and their more enlightened expectations even in 21st-century Islamic countries.\nHaving highlighted some uncontroversial observations about Islam which many Muslims would accept, it is time to consider why Islam escapes serious scrutiny, when it is clear that scrutiny is simply asking Islamic scholars to explain Islamic doctrine and justify Islamic law in the context of the enlightened 21st-century. The problem really is not about Islam but about a form of inverted racism practised by a misguided liberal establishment that prevents proper scrutiny of Islam and it’s doctrines. We call this bourgeois racism. It is the racism of the well-intended but anxious elite.\nIslam as we have said has some uncompromising attitudes which are clearly out of step with modern progressive values. The problem for the elite however is that they have a superficial understanding of Islam which is shaped by how Islam is presented to non-believers by the Islamic community. It is also influenced by fear of racism.\nStarting with ignorance. The liberal mind has become shaped by concepts like moral relativity. ‘Relativity’ is fine when one is doing one’s schoolwork on Islam and one compares church with Mosque or Zakat with Charity or maybe, look at rituals like fasting in Lent and fasting at Ramadan. So, the idea in the consciousness of the modern liberal is that Islam is like other religions, it has its ‘divine narrative’, which they would reject as fanciful nonsense, as they do with Christianity. But, and it is a big but, to the liberal, Islam is exclusively practised by people with a darker skin colour so to criticise Islam is like racism and against the liberal ideology of being ‘welcoming’ and ‘inclusive’.\nThis conflation of religion and skin colour has become so established that Islamicists have taken to associating criticism of Islam with a ‘kind of racism’. The upshot of this confusion about Islamic ideas and the association of Islam with race is that there is perceived by the BBC or other liberal organisations to be no problem with Islam. Any ‘problem’ is not a problem at all, its racism.\nThe consciousness of the traditional Muslim whilst at odds with much western thinking should in the 21st-century be open to robust challenge. But it is not! Many are happy to believe in the Quran and Hadith and see in Islam a God-ordained antidote to western secularism. Any difficulty secularists and non-believers face challenging Islam are therefore caused by an ignorant, patronising smug bourgeois elite treating Muslims as potential victims of ‘racial’ abuse, if anyone says anything bad about their faith of Islam.\nSo, what is the answer? Well in classical Marxist terms religion reflects various stages in the development of human consciousness. The consciousness associated with twenty-first-century western enlightenment cannot be passed over as an irrelevance whilst one fetishizes belief systems and codes of morality based on first or seventh-century ideas. To do so is dangerous. Dangerous because its too easy to slide back to where you have been rather than progress to an uncertain and maybe more equal, less faith-based and therefore less elitist future. Open and respectful dialogue with people who stand up for their belief system whatever it is is essential. As is an end to seeing Islam race-based. Islam is no more raced based than say socialism. Ideas are not racial but people are.",

The process has already started.\nCapitalism was described as ‘anarchy’ by numerous socialist thinkers in the 19th century. This anarchy was founded on the liberating principles of consent-based choice and contract. They were the three universal rules, and everyone had to play by them. The affluent merchant and later industrial producer as well as the exploited worker who toiled to make both the merchant and industrialist rich were legally obliged to observe contract and consent-based choice.\nThe role of the banking system within this model was to expand the economy cautiously and incrementally with increased money supply occurring as the combination of capital and labour power fused to drive the demand for goods, achieve their supply via productivity, and thus create profits.\nIt was always an uneasy relationship, this relationship between demand and supply, and crisis often occurred when supply was greater than demand. People were laid off and the economy shrank. Company failure was in the very beginning the reset button. Companies failed and new opportunities sprang up to improve the quality and price of goods and take on more workers. At least that was the theory.\nAs capitalism matured though, rather than just individual company failures, capitalism’s free market drive for profits led to the consolidation of production. Basically, bigger companies grew out of smaller company failures. When a crisis occurred the state also intervened to increase demand by pumping money into the economy so people could buy goods. This is demand management and it was essentially a left-wing state interventionist response to capitalisms periodic failures. It benefited the working class by creating jobs to stimulate demand.\nBy the 1970’s Western capitalism was in serious trouble because profitability was being squeezed. Consolidation within industries had made them complacent and sluggish. Wages had been increased to a more humane level, but this had hit profitability. Wages could not slide back as profits slumped. There were few realistic options available, company failures grew, and demand for products fell. In addition to this crisis in profitability companies were hit by a spike in energy prices causing inflation coupled to the downturn in demand.\nThe UK had an additional problem a belief that ‘the state’ should take money off the taxpayer to pay the workers in nationalised industries, not as a demand stimulus but as an entitlement. The left-wing orthodoxy of demand management was no longer delivering what it was supposed to. The West was now in competition with the rest of the world and demand management and government ownership would not help. . . Indeed, it seemed to be making matters worse.\nIf demand management was no longer effective, because it contributed to general inflation as fewer products were being manufactured there was poor quality, high public expenditure and wage inflation, so the thinking went that maybe liberalising the supply side of the economy would do the business of saving the Western world’s economy. ‘Supply side’ in effect means ensuring that supplies of all goods and services are delivered efficiently at the cheapest possible price. This of course includes labour power or the supply of workers as well as the supply of money itself. As long as things were cheap, the general inflation rate was low and interest rates ‘competitive’ the money supply could increase, thus stimulating demand without causing inflation and everything should remain in balance.\nFor forty years this model has infected every aspect of thinking, from government and business in the 1980’s and 1990’s to the public sector from 2000 onwards.\nIt began with selling council houses in the 1980’s. Valuable housing assets were taken from Local Authorities and were transferred to the banking sector and financial services industries via mortgages. This increased the money that individuals could ‘leverage’ or borrow against their housing asset. It was however sold as a political good news story for workers rather than a good news story for the banking sector.\nThe Government thus moved a huge number of public assets into the financial and service sectors and with that the means of managing demand became a function of the supply of money, money created not by the combination of capital exploiting labour. but by the ability of the financial services and banking sector to create money with whatever assets they were able to use to leverage. The markets rather than the government controlled this process. If general inflation was low, any amount of money created could only grow the economy. It was an Alice in Wonderland model based on political naivety, public expectation, and financial services hubris.\nThe assets that could be leveraged therefore included ex council homes and stocks and shares in once nationalised industries.\nMy suspicion at the time was that in the minds of politicians this money supply side approach would generate healthy demand and create a variety of jobs satisfying the need for both new goods as well as services. However in the minds of bankers and global corporations the West would become awash with cheap goods made outside of the West. These cheap goods would keep inflation down, profits up and as money circulated this would provide service sector jobs creating an illusion of a strong ‘real economy’.\nIt worked for a while but the problem with money and general supply side management is that someone must supply the cheap money, justify that supply with assets and without causing inflation and do it within a context of slowly reducing well-paid manufacturing employment for working people.\nBy the late 1990’s it was clear that the supply side model was running out of steam, but the demand model was still debunked. Blair’s government adopted supply side orthodoxy uncritically and took supply side ideology into the public sector, hoping to ‘tee’ the public sector up for privatisation.\nThe push for home ownership, started in the UK by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives when they sold council homes became the way money supply expanded. More mortgages, more borrowing against house price inflation, more money swilling around, more credit card debt. With the growth od ‘derivatives’ there were opportunities to bundle up mortgages and sell them to investors as risk-free investments, with, in theory, a good return as people made their mortgage repayments each month. The ‘markets’ grip on reality was loosening.\nThis bit of supply side exuberance lasted until 2007. The breath-taking level of overreach by the banking sector resulted in the crash of 2007/8. The banks had balance sheets based on high house price values. But these prices were not a reflection of the strength of the property market or economy in general and therefore didn’t reflect people’s ability to repay their loans. Just as now, there was and remains no ‘real economy’ just money supply within a context of low interest rates and low inflation. With no real economy, people defaulted on their huge and unrealistic mortgage loans. The whole banking system was bankrupt and crashed.\nBecause the West had moved headlong into supply side economics out of economic necessity, the only solution to the banking crisis was bank bailouts by governments and the introduction of stupidly low almost zero interest rates.\nThis was the next crank of the supply side screw. Again, it worked. For a while. People borrowed and spent; house building expanded to meet a fictional ‘high demand’ but continued to be bought as investments at ever increasing prices. This further expanding money supply and stimulated demand in a low inflation era. The supply of cheap imported unskilled labour continued, as did the importation of goods made abroad. With low inflation nothing seemed to threaten this model. Keep on importing cheap labour (labour needs housing too), keep spending money, buying houses, and borrowing and all will be good. At least for the bankers and corporations.\nBy the late 2000’s new threats were beginning to emerge. One such threat is that the West has an ageing population of people who own their own their own homes outright. This locks that house price ‘value’ out of the banking system. There is therefore a glut of housing, which offers nothing of monetary value to the banking system unless equity released or sold after death. But then housing gluts would likely force down prices. Good for buyers, bad for the markets.\nThe supply side monetary model needs high house prices and for prices to rise year on year. The markets have been lucky as since 2008 and until 2022 nothing has seriously threatened the supply side fundamentals of low general inflation, low interest rates and escalating house and other ‘asset’ prices. Even Brexit didn’t succeed in slowing the flow of cheap unskilled labour still much needed to make the model of supply side economics work.\nHowever, amplified by the war in Ukraine, Chinese paranoia over Covid and energy price instability it is now becoming clear that the supply side model is not without serious consequences for ordinary people. Viewing it uncritically and continually trying to get it to work is undermining society on an almost irreparable scale.\nIn addition to the export of manufacturing to cheap labour markets like China, thus destroying livelihoods for millions of British working people, there is the additional consequence that poor wages and welfare generates too little demand and doesn’t help local economies. Town centres and less fashionable cities like Stoke on Trent become dormitories for migrant workers a growing number of whom arrive with little inclination to work. They thus provide no meaningful economic demand, and only take up the slack in the town and city centre market for Houses of Multiple Occupation.\nThe consequence of supply side economics failing to deliver sufficient economic demand in town and city centres is that these locations become shabby ‘melting pots’, managed reactively by police and local authorities. Adopting supply side orthodoxy themselves agencies only supply services on an ‘intelligence led’ basis, thus leaving people to essentially fend for themselves. No wonder people are angry. The money needed to rejuvenate town centres ends up in the hands of new build property developers who take full advantage on the flight of indigenous locals to the outskirts of town. Once in a new build, wages don’t go into the local economy, they go into home entertainment and fancy cars, both necessary to survive the numbing existence offered by these locations.\nThe supply side orthodoxy was so enthusiastically taken up by the banking system and financial markets that it was considered an appropriate model to inflict on the public and educational sector. Students became consumers and higher education supplied an educational product; the financial risk being borne by the student.\nThe orthodoxy of supply side economics has turned public services into organisations which supply products and interventions, and the efficiency of this supply is calculated by ‘score cards and performance measures. The proliferation of measurers and managers who oversee this process has created a class system within the public sector with grotesque wage differentials to reflect this. The toxicity of supply side management has created a mental health and recruitment and retention crisis all over the public sector.\nSo, in summary, the supply side revolution, which seemed so logical back in the late 1970’s has faltered and has now stopped. Its survival, as an economic theory is destroying western society. In its death throws it retains an ability to generate wealth for the few. But for the many a depleting lifestyle of declining local economies, poor town centre housing stock, debt, high inward migration, with the associated flight from town centres by the remaining workers is the reality.\nFor the supply side model to do what it does efficiently low interest rates need to fuel borrowing and therefore spending binge and of course inflation must be low assisted by low wages and cheap foreign manufactured products. However, the longer this process continues, like a black hole the denser the problems it leaves behind will be.\nWith a forty-year supply side orthodoxy the West is not so much an economy as a series of interconnected money manufacturing markets that are sensitive to changes in economic fundamentals like general inflation, and interest rates. The war in Ukraine and Covid have unleashed disturbances that will have long term effects. The bankers and markets will blame Brexit for Britain’s struggle to get back on track. The real answer however is to move away from supply side orthodoxy and get back to managing demand at a level that creates real jobs, wealth, and happiness, without creating inflation. That means putting power back into politics and taking it away from the markets.

Are these issues linked?\nWe generally discuss the policies promoted within the western world in economic terms. But of course, there are very serious social consequences to these economic policies. The western world needs to ensure aggregate demand is maintained to ensure economic “growth” can manage the debt and pension liabilities it’s ageing population, ill and welfare dependent, require. In total, there are Billions of pounds worth of social liabilities associated with hundreds of thousands of people.\nIn the absence of a developed economy creating real economic value, rather than relying on debt as the Uk has been for the last forty years, the long term prognosis looks very dire indeed. The whole situation is made worse by the fact that no western economy is likely to start turning out real value unless it is re-engineered along with and the markets which service it. These markets include the welfare, education and labour markets. All these markets are expensive to run being largely functions of and therefore paid for by the State on behalf of the public. Carry on the way we are going and the country (not just the State) will be bankrupt in about fifteen years time.\nSo how do these markets affect the two issues above? In the modern economy with progressive legislation, the need for the government to manipulate certain “desirable” social outcomes shouldn’t really be necessary. Indeed the government should be on the look out for any contra-indications i.e. things that might be going wrong. Typically the world of work should allow people to choose what they want to do rather than having the State manipulating them into doing what the State thinks they should be doing. In this respect, there have been a number of shifts towards policies which on the face of it look progressive but in fact have discouraged responsible and economically sane behaviours.\nThe Tax credit has affected the labour market driving part time workers into the workforce whilst the cost of supporting their family in borne by the State. The knock on effect is that there is an increase in under-employed workers, working twenty hours, whilst the social needs of the community are met by the State and its health and welfare sectors. The part-time workers would be better employed working in their communities and families as happened in the past; looking after mum and dad and the kids rather than doing shelf stacking at a supermarket. A shift towards remaining in the home could be met with howls from the feminist lobby, however, rights are not embedded in society if the state has to pay top dollar to maintain them. This is particularly relevant when it is national debt paying for all of it. Of course, it contradicts current “progressive” left thinking. The “progressive” left see welfare as in important part of the British economy which just underscores how delusional they all are. Welfare is necessary but please it really can’t be seen as part of the “real economy” whatever that is, if it is funded from national debt.\nSimilarly, young people may be in education until eighteen but whilst this does suggest they may be deferring parenthood for a couple of years, it increases expectations and renders them unwilling to undertake menial work. This is the mischief that “free movement of people” is intended to solve. It is a government-engineered and tax payer funded problem which costs the government and therefore taxpayer money to solve. Nice work!. The minimum wage was introduced as a means of ensuring that migration didn’t destroy wage levels. Perversely with no migration and no minimum wage, wages would go up the only pressure bearing down would be young people entering the workforce.\nFinally in respect of the single mums. A single mum struggling to bring kids up alone is not giving their child the best “first three years”. Additionally detached from older relatives they all too often contribute too little to their child and community. Children and particularly infants need a lot of time and parenthood is demanding. We know one of us was a single dad. Again welfare engineers the “single mum” taking women out of the workforce full time but supporting them to struggle on their own or in part-time work with too little time to help those in the community who may need their help.\nToday there is no need to gender any of the above. A single mum could just as well be a single dad. The person at home could be male or female. Th point is and using the widest definition of social need (kids to the elderly) social care is not a just a government problem……it is a social one also!\n06.12.16 How safe is the world for people who are ordinary, powerless and or poor? V2\nFor the table top revolutionaries here at a Blue Revolution the big question is how safe are we in a world where the west is morally and financially bankrupt and the bits that work or seem to work are at the top of the social pile. The higher up the social ladder you are the more stable your life and the greater are the opportunities you can provide for your children. If you are at the bottom of the pile you probably have a life which whilst not at all identical in the type of uncertainty you would have experienced in the past, none the less you have fear and uncertainty to deal with often on a daily basis.\nFear and uncertainty for those at the bottom who burdened by debt, are benefitting those at the top, many of whom are the State its officers and officials, present and retired. The State has become a self-regarding and self-perpetuating behemoth. It seems to us that the State claims to speak in the name of the people, but serves its own ends and interests using the people as its justification. Welfare, health and Justice being examples but it could include the military too.\nThe left wing liberal State wails about a lack of social mobility and the widening wealth gap, but look below the surface and we can see that the State pays its top people or allows publicly funded top people to be paid indirectly from general taxation, multiples of what the British Prime Minister is paid. Please Don’t even get us started on the differentials between them and us.\nThose who benefit financially like all too many left leaning liberals, send their children to schools which confer privilege, whilst bemoaning a lack of opportunity for the poor. The working and lower middle classes need stable families (no uncertainty “gamed” by excessive welfare) and Grammar schools to assist them to enter the upper reaches of the establishment. From there they will start to dismantle the interests of the liberal elite starting with excessive wages at the top. No wonder the liberal elite does not want to support the ambitions of the blue collar workers.\nSo to answer the question above let us address the issue of how safe we ordinary people are with a liberal elite running our State on their own behalf. Well obviously not very safe, from our vantage point at least. They have spent the last fifty years looking after themselves at our expense. The EU question is more about them than us, and whilst they may have brainwashed a lot of under 25’s we grey-beards can see that the EU is their project not ours. And so is so much more besides.\nWe don’t think that the liberal elite is out to get us, us being right wing working people. Far from it, they are not out to get us or do anything other than maintaining a status quo which works for them and is funded by us. Hence their pathetic “Remain” campaign in the UK. However, this “doing very little” lets the more energetic, aggressive and ideological, drive an agenda even a subversive agenda, which could be very much against our long-term interests. These people and this agenda could be Islamist or fascist. If you don’t accept this analysis from where did ISIS suddenly arrive. They were not beamed down from space! Someone knew and no one really cared.\nThe world is basically feudal with Saudi Arabia at one end, a fully formed feudal system which Henry the VIII would have recognised, China in the middle and the serially feudal democratic “western hegemonies” at the other end. Why do we think our society is feudal even the US? Because we just elect a handful of people to rule us every now and again. As Germany found in 1933 the election bit can be set aside, now and again, as required by any crisis that the economy throws up.\nThe western liberal elite has no moral guts or gumption, they flip flop around their precious “Diversity” agenda as a proxy for doing something about the sexism and racism and homophobia inherent in religions that have not been cleansed of their prejudicial nonsense by capitalism. They think that as they, the liberal elite, currently hold power and see themselves as “progressive”, we are all Ok, long term. Of course, this is partly because they have lined their kids up (Blairs, Kinnocks, and all the others) to take over our from them so our interests must be safe!!!\nOur interests are not safe, can’t be safe with these people. The State is an almost exclusive club and is run by one basically liberal elite class. This class can be easily replaced if the wrong type of revolution takes place. A thick, lazy, underclass and a disengaged working class engineered by the elite to be docile, will put up no resistance when the atavism of other ideologies starts to bang on the door of our pathetic liberal elite. At that point the rights we enjoy (women’s, gay, trans, children’s, religious etc) and they pretend to protect will go, and a modern techno brutality will replace western liberalism. It is the working and lower middle classes which will suffer. The liberal elite will simply look at us, see us as too much trouble and begin to dismantle “our” State in the name of their new best friends and their State: whoever they are. And dismantle us with it.\nOh and just for good measure, we at a Blue Revolution don’t think the Trump-Putin alliance is a problem. Fear of it is just another example of the lack of moral guts which has become the hallmark of the “liberal elite”. Trump might be odd but he is unlikely to patronise the poor….he might cut welfare or something but may, as a result, energise the poor to use their skills to bring the US economy back to life. We have a lot more in common with the Russians and Chinese but it is Saudi Arabia which is our ally and we have nothing in common with them! Go figure!\nThe real enemy is the liberal elite our own enemy within.\n15.12.16 The West’s attitude to Assad and Russia’s success in Syria reflects the fag end of America’s dick waggling imperialism. With Trump, America might lead a coalition of cooperation and trade. America can then put its dick away!!\nNice way of summing up seventy years of American international policy! However ever since the 1940’s we have been forced to conclude that Russia was our sworn enemy and as a result, we have wasted between all western nations trillions of dollars “defending” ourselves from this largely illusory bogeyman. As with the EU trade would have been a better method of bringing a long-term peace than MAD…..for those too young to know, this stood for mutually assured destruction. In other words, if you kill me with your big dick I’ll kill you with mine!\nHaving hinted we are unilateralists it is necessary to clarify that we are not. We do not see Russia or China as an existential threat, they are in fact no more delinquent than we are but are delinquent in different ways (theft of intellectual property, doping athletes, limits to freedom of speech). Trade will bring us together (as independent nations) better than treaties and agreements unless they are a trade agreement. We need to maintain a nuclear deterrent because whilst Russia and China won’t nuke us there are plenty of nuclear powers and pretenders to the nuclear thrones who would love to blast the west and themselves into eternity.\n19.12.16 In the 1950’s and 1960’s the grammar schooled working class were an executive in waiting. That’s why the elite have engineered our indebtedness or our sad dependence on them as an underclass. A Blue Revolution is needed.\nNice way of summing up seventy years of American international policy! However ever since the 1940’s we have been forced to conclude that Russia was our sworn enemy and as a result, we have wasted between all western nations trillions of dollars “defending” ourselves from this largely illusory bogeyman. As with the EU trade would have been a better method of bringing a long-term peace than MAD…..for those too young to know, this stood for mutually assured destruction.

We need to maintain a nuclear deterrent because whilst Russia and China won’t nuke us there are plenty of nuclear powers and pretenders to the nuclear thrones who would love to blast the west and themselves into eternity.\nLet’s us be honest the aristocracy has no power today and that is absolutely right. The aristocracy was stripping value from the peasants for centuries until first the merchants and then the techno merchants of the industrial revolution slowly undermined their power and wealth until with the democracy of the consumer economy we finally saw off the last vestiges of their power. We left their wealth intact. We don’t begrudge them their wealth; it was legitimately appropriated by the standards of the day.\nthe capitalists drove an unusual agenda promoting able people regardless of rank. But this was also the era of clogs to clogs capitalism, where grandad built up the business, the son maintained it and the grandson wasted the legacy. When left to natural ability alone they were in many cases incapable of transferring talent between the generations. Capitalism had failure built into it and quite right too. Life has failure built into it!\nWill Romeo Beckham have the talent to be an international footballer like his dad?……probably not! But no shame in that; that’s life. Will he benefit from his father’s wealth, probably yes. Is this fair…yes and no. Will the wealth last more than two generations…probably not.\nSo the aristocrats lost out to the capitalists the capitalists have however had the most ignominious loss as they have lost out to the state itself. Capitalism once value generating has gone and been replaced by the all-consuming State. A State funded by but not operated in the interests of the people. unlike the heydey of capitalism when the state needed capitalists money; when capitalists took control of the essentially feudal state and made it work for them, the state is now an entity set apart from the people, empowered by the weakness of capital and driven to expand its influence due to the public’s corrosive appetite for consumption. It, the “State” is returning to its feudal roots buoyed by its own self-importance.\nThe state is now using its power to protect itself and promote its self-interest via our public and private debt and taxation. The whole system works for a political and financial elite many of whom rely on the stupidity and debt of the general public to maintain their position. The cull on grammars ensures that no one is going to challenge this system. It came too close to it in the 1960’s so it ain’t going to happen again anytime soon. It is going to be as difficult to shift the publicsectocracy as it was to undermine the power of the aristocracy centuries ago. But it was done eventually by ordinary talented people; dissenters, merchants and capitalists and latterly traditional socialists who saw the harm unregulated power could do.\nWe can look at some examples of this beginning with criminal justice in the UK. The Criminal Justice System is a relic of the feudal past an unyielding system unable to give way to change. It has always reflected the values of the day, values promoted by the state, but in the face of progress has managed to retain its feudal appearance, wigs, gowns etc as the State it represented has morphed, matured and grown up with economic progress, it remained a farcical pantomime dame.\nThe law is expensive and serves the needs of the lawyers to an extent we believe is wholly at odds with the needs of the people. Take civil justice and the costs ratchet up into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The public win or loose, see lawyers getting fat on the debt and misery of the public. Should “justice” break the bank?…of course not. No society can function without an accessible Justice System. That is why in the West civil justice doesn’t really deliver affordable justice to the public and the maturity of civil society is correspondingly undermined. If Justice becomes expensive or under-funded then the lawyers move on and leave a moral vacuum to be filled by immoral legislation, just as they have done with divorce.\nYou can see where they go; they go to where the State will still fund them. Lawyer-legislators pave the way with lucrative earning opportunities such as Human Rights, but they will foray into other obscure stuff too stuff like misfeasance or misconduct. As long as the state lawyer cum legislators continue to make and then determine what laws are funded at the state’s expense, lawyers will get rich….rich and entitled to more.\nThe underclass provides a veritable swamp of criminal and immoral behaviour which also provides lucrative feeding opportunities for herds of lawyers. The public with their broken homes and imprisoned or drug addicted children watch as these parasites walk off with fortunes as the elderly rot in care homes or are abandoned and lonely. The breakdown of Civil Society might be bad for the masses but it is excellent news for the lawyers and an army of well remunerated senior managers in the “lucrative” State sector as well as leaders of “commissioned” services like social care for the elderly. A Blue Revolution would tip the balance back towards the people and away from our self-selecting masters by de-scaling their salaries, or simply making them redundant. Whlst it won’t be a bloody revolution it will be the slaughter of the excessive salary and the made up job!\n27.12.16 As we end 2016 we believe that in the last 18 months we have explored the roots of the west’s terminal moral and economic decline. We sign off 2016 and herald 2017 as the year of solutions.\nHappy new year to all our readers. We hope that a Blue Revolution 2016 has been both entertaining and challenging. Next year the really scary stuff starts. What exactly can you do to put the west back on its horse and once again start leading the world in a much needed moral renaissance?\nThe areas we will cover will include correcting the economic fundamentals of the misfiring western economy, the western education system, criminal justice and why it doesn’t work, democracy and the west’s democratic deficit, welfare, taxation, human rights and how we should both understand but not accept the causes of culturally defended abuses of basic human rights, and on what basis we\ncan construct a framework of rights which has a buy-in from around the globe….. oh and probably more on the EU (unfortunately!) But we will start 2017 with our analysis of “post-truth” politics.\n01.01.17 Post truth politics: the elite’s last desperate bit to undermine populism with their version of thought crime!\nWho would have thought that people who have been manipulating the public’s views on everything from who is our friend and who is our enemy all the way down to what we should think about moral issues such as abortion, debt or single parenthood should begin to undermine populism with the laughable claim that populism has all been the result of “post factual politics” or “post-truth” politics.\nThe sad reality of the situation is that “post-truth” politics has been going on since the end of World war II. It was initially underhand and was used to protect the interests of the predominantly American political and military hegemony. This included maintaining the idea that Russia was the world’s greatest bogey-man along with a number of other minor bogeymen, such as Castro or Saddam Hussain. Post-truth politics came out from the cold and went mainstream during the years of the Blair/Clinton/Bush administrations. Clintons claim not to have has sex with Monica Lewinsky and the Blair years with their “dodgy dossier” and countless other lapses and oversights which have landed the UK in the soup in Iraq and with the whole EU situation arose from an unwillingness, to be frank with the public.\nThe problem for the US UK and European elites is that populism is not caused by recent post-truth politics (dismal though it is) it is a direct result of the much earlier post-truth politicians telling the public stuff that the public either didn’t believe or came to recognise were exaggerations or lies. Blair and the Clintons are the master practitioners of these dark arts. They, not the Brexiteers or Donald Trump have created populism and we are grateful to them for their efforts. It is inevitable that the state would eventually overreach itself and have its legitimacy called into question resulting in its eventual diminution and final occupation by the people. However thanks to the hubris of Clinton and the Blairs the process may have been speeded up somewhat.\nThe response of the elite is to treat the public like thought criminals. What will be next, removal of our right to vote!\n03.01.17 The left wing elite “all sound and fury but signifying nothing”\nIf you have ever had the pleasure of being “caught out” by a left-wing liberal, particularly one who is in receipt of an income courtesy of the state, an MP, for example, you would be struck by the passion and fury or as we would argue faux moral outrage. It doesn’t matter whether it is a reference to the contradictions within feminism or promoting Brexit the outrage is often disproportionate to the value of the point being made. This disproportionate response reflects the lack of depth associated with the left’s argument.\nThe liberal left wing and like them those luvvies who have a conscience significantly smaller than their ego but who have been told by their agents or the liberal media about the value of believing in “fairness”, “justice” “equality” will always promote the left cause. They believe the left have a monopoly on universal human values! They promote the left’s causes because they feel that someone must do something but it won’t be them, they will use their “profile” to raise the issue so that the state can spend money sorting out the issue for them. This process has been referred to as virtue signalling.\nThe problem for the liberal left is that the people who actually try and solve the problem whatever it is, poverty, ignorance social failure are those who actually create it. The state itself. They try and solve it using massive amounts of taxpayers money but succeed only in promoting themselves and their cause at the expense of the taxpaying public and encouraging the slow relentless decline of collective moral behaviour.\nThere are two problems with the left-wing status quo and its continued existence under the Conservative government in the UK. One is that the people will never get the state off their back until they stop playing the state’s moral social and economic degeneration game, for example, running up personal debt as the west’s social values go into reverse. the second problem is that the whole of the state legal, political and economic elite perpetuates the problem. Just look at left wing lawyers. They present themselves as champions of the oppressed individual who is abused by the state, but they largely forget as they quaff expensive wine that it is the state that pays them from legal aid and this is drawn from taxation, levied on the debt-laden taxpayer.\nIt is like a perverse protection racket where human rights and anti-state “liberal left” lawyers, act on behalf of the individual to protect them from the racketeering state, but in doing so take money indirectly from those they are trying to protect, taxpayers; without realising or more likely not caring that they are simply adding to the people’s burden of exploitation. They are the conduit that turns the person wronged by the state against the people who have to pay for the case and all for their personal profit. John Bon Jovi, Springsteen, Eddie Izzard et al and the left establishment and the west’s elite lawyers all sound and fury signifying nothing.\n05.01.17 Without its Christian anchor western Capitalism has morphed into a free market of no value and manufactured wealth. We offer a global solution!\nThe world can’t undo capitalism even though some of the left would like to. The morality underpinning capitalism was Christianity. Protestant Christianity offered a code of behaviour based on personal moral restraint. Combined with the workings of labour and capital this moral restraint created value in unprecedented volumes which transformed the world.\nWith the exception of a few malcontents who fail to understand the social progress ushered in by the capitalist economic revolution, most agree that capitalism was not immoral. Unfair perhaps, but not immoral. On this latter point, even Karl Marx agreed.\nSocialism in Britain after World War two sought to correct capitalism’s unfairness and at the same time much more of the world opened up to the productive capacity unleashed by the capitalist model, (even when under the control of the command and control states of Russia and China).\nIt was this combination socialism at home and capitalism abroad which helped evolve the western capitalist model in the west, sheering off the self-restraint required by Christianity as competition became wide-ranging and expectations of western workers too high. Financial engineering was the west’s salvation delivering the now fetishised “free market”.\nThe experience of social and moral decline, combined with a free market which has no restraining forces (commodifying everything in effect) has delivered a world of debt and greed and unnatural extremes of wealth. The holy grail of “trickle down” economics will not happen largely because of the free market. Unlike capitalism, the free market is not a system based on moral relationships but on financial ones. A bit like the internet!!\nThe relationship between capitalist and worker was as much moral as economic. The capitalist employed the worker and paid him/her wages, both were interdependent. The whole system encouraged both respect and self-reliance for self and others. The political left wing in Europe has undermined this morality and replaced it with a morality based on state intervention and tax payers cash whilst financial engineering as delivered the final moral blow. This has left the western hegemony devoid of moral content.\nMuch of the world has never enjoyed the moral relationship enjoyed by Christian capitalism. This is reflected in too many parts of the world in relationships between people who have no power to challenge their modern feudal overlords. There has never been a capitalist revolution in these countries many oppressive regimes of which are propped up with wealth from natural resources like oil. No need to garner the respect of a working class there. Just keep whatever passes as a working class in their place.\nThe problem with the western hegemony is, however, most starkly seen in the appalling state of relationships between the sexes. In many respects, the “free market” is taking relationships between the sexes back to a pre-capitalist age where men were able to assume an uncontracted dominion over women and as a result, the state now has to intervene to protect some woman from men. Domestic abuse, sexual violence, pornography and child abuse are all phenomenon that, whilst they have always been present, are now becoming a western epidemic. Of course, this abuse goes on in Somalia, Niger, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia etc, but as we have suggested these countries have never had a culture based on Contract, Choice and Consent; the west’s Christian and Capitalist foundations.\nSo with Christianity now weakened to the point of irrelevance in the west, cultures with no tradition of Christianity or Capitalism are becoming pre-eminent and Christian values in he west are giving way pre-capitalist relations This is happening between the sexes, classes, races and nationalities even in the west (relations based on compulsion, coercion and control underpinned by suspicion). The world has a major problem. What could possibly be the answer?\nTo try and answer this we need to look at what we can learn from the evolution of humanity. Firstly every epoch leaves a trail of characteristics some good and some not so good. We need to look at what capitalism has left behind now it is on its way to long-term oblivion leaving the vestiges of some good things which are obscured by the smoke and mirrors of the corrupted free market (the free market is not bad, just the western corrupted one based on government spending and financial engineering)\nThe story of humankind journey begins at the point at which we ceased to be mere beasts of the field. When we evolved a “species-essence” distinct from the animals. The characteristics of man’s “species-essence” is to consciously cooperate to ensure the species survival. The positive characteristic of this era was that most enjoyed the spoils of the cooperative effort equally. There was little in the way of hierarchy or selfishness. The negative side was that with rare exceptions there was a yawning gulf between the status of men and women. The origins of objectification were born during this phase of mankind’s existence, the original, original sin was born! And so it survives today as objectification in a very much weakened but none the less corrosive form in the west.\nThe feudal system created hierarchy and conferred power by rank. This is against mankind’s species-essence which is essentially cooperative. Capitalism moved the rank structure from a model based on birthright to one based on the acquisition of production value and the exploitation of those who created the value, the workers.\nHowever notwithstanding exploitation capitalism’s positive legacy was to free people from feudal bondage. With capitalism’s Christian underpinnings, rights to contract, make free choices and consent to an action involving them, people gained theoretical if not actual, useable rights. This process of contract choice and consent has driven mankind forward, increasing productive capacity and providing a light touch moral framework that all participants accepted as the best means of progressing and ordering society. The problem is that socialism in the hands of the state has been forced to correct capitalism’s less desirable side effects….essentially the class system and the exploitation of workers. Because capitalism was incapable of doing it for itself the state has taken a sledgehammer to crack a walnut!\nNow however the work of the state is largely done in the UK and Europe (not so the US) and so we could see a revival of social relations based on the concepts of contract choice and consent with the corresponding uplift in moral behaviour.The state can then begin to shed some of the responsibilities it has acquired but can no longer afford and can start to hand powers to a population now far less exploited and more willing and able to play its part within the body of the state itself.\nIf we look elsewhere in the world, we can see that there are still too many places that have a society based on tribal culture the most notable and “advanced” being Saudi Arabia, and others which are essentially feudal, Syria and North Africa being examples. We can look at the world and see what stage of humanity any culture is essentially defined by and therefore how divisive or exploitative it is.\nWe can and should also wonder about a future with capitalism running out of steam and Christianity in a weakened condition. What can be done to progress the world and her cultures towards a more enlighted place? Creating a progressive and hopefully in time just and cooperative global identity, a reflection of mankind’s universal species essence.\nThe answer to all of us at a Blue Revolution is to get the world and her people to accept that whatever one might think about Capitalism past, and where it still holds sway, present, the legacy of contract, choice and consent has helped liberate people from tyranny and abuse.\nThe western world weakened and indebted should champion the rights of all peoples in the world by demanding that every adult of whatever race or gender should be accorded the right to contract, choose and consent and that any culture that denies these rights is somehow failing to respect people’s species essence and is, therefore, to various degrees discriminatory, oppressive, cruel or barbaric. We should shame both our friends and our enemies and use the legacy of capitalism to champion the rights of women, children, the poor and dispossessed and set them on the path to freedom and democracy.\n09.01.17 How close to achieving her goal of making Britain work for everyone is Theresa May? We apply a Blue Revolutionary rinse to her proposals! V2\nThis post was going to be about generation “snowflake” and what might have caused many of the youth of today to be so weak, over-sensitive and passive aggressive. It was going to explore the origins of this phenomenon and arrive at an explanation for it. However in the UK Theresa May has given a speech which covers the same turf, albeit from a slightly different angle.\nWe believe that generation “snowflake” is the product of Blairism and what might now be called the generation “state” namely their parents. Blair, Brown, Starmer and the other theologians of the British “third way” created a self-defined benign form of intervention which consolidated the power of the state at the sharp end of social and economic engineering. There remain many losers some in their 50’s but many more did very well too. This generation “state” is the younger generation of the post-war “baby boomers” the under 60’s, those who voted for Blair and have benefitted from “Blairism”, the debt, welfare and public sector expansion of the naughties.\nAs a result of Blairism, a class of parents was created who became reliant on a combination of “third-way” debt based state generosity, and who learnt to absorb high levels of personal debt. In exchange for this “affluence”, these people had to suck up identity politics and accept a loose moral culture which encouraged adolescence well into middle age. A generation “state” was created for whom personal responsibility was undermined by a so-called benign state. This “benign” system has forged an even more damaged generation, the psychologically broken snowflakes. It has also led to the elderly; the older baby boomers (and older still) being abandoned on an industrial scale by a now almost broke state funded care system. And still the left wing, the vulnerable and the delusional call out to the state for help. To them we say….”don’t you get it”. “The state can’t help, the best it can do is spend more money and still things will only get worse”.\nPhysical and mental distress caused by Blairs “things can only get better” hubris. Where is his nemesis?!\nAs we have suggested the middle and working class parents of the Blair era had in addition to state subsidised multiple “reconstituted families”, debt-fuelled affluence which could be paid off from further debt rescheduling on the back of inflating house prices. Their offspring, living in this unstable and for them, an unachievable la-la land, became insecure and sometimes deeply disturbed and needy. As a result many lack the kind of personal resilience which makes for a strong and effective society and although “bright” they reject criticism and challenge so socially, economically and morally undermined do they feel. This cultural phenomenon has been transformed into no platforming and “safe spaces”. Undermining free speech one of the pillars of democracy.\nTheis parents, generation “state” are a complicated demographic and in many ways are a natural Blue Revolutionary constituency; Euro-sceptic, hard working, skilled. However unlike a normal Blue Revolution constituency collectively they have benefitted from inflated house prices and low-interest rates. Many have retired early with good public sector pensions and they can afford new cars and holidays.\nWhat causes the problem is that they have failed to contextualise their success and to understand the differential reality their “snowflake” offspring have experienced since their birth in early to mid-1990’s. This failure of generation “state” to understand the basis of their good fortune alienates one generation from another. The two most significant and active political generations, young adults and their parents don’t “get” each other! The people Mrs May needs to appeal to are in reality are the young adults, they are the “JAM’s” they have lost out to their parents big time. they are the ones for whom she spoke about “seeing other people getting on ……etc”.\nThe generation “state” demographic have enjoyed a series of governments who have engineered their continued financial success, but at a massive cost to their socially and economically vulnerable offspring. Whether it is Quantitative Easing, the financial deficit, housing policy (inflating private housing and not building public housing), low-interest rates, abolishing retirement ages, creating student loans, zero hours contracts, abolishing vocational training in the 1990’s or maintaining top public sector salaries, it is all conspiring to ensure that the new young adults (some now working parents) feel that they are failures in contrast to their “successful” parents. The young voted remain because they believed the EU bureaucracy was there to help them. Unlike the “Tories and Westminster” who seem to them only to represent the interests of their parents.\nThe confusion as seen by us at a Blue Revolution is that it was Blair’s generation “State” who were forced to suck up “third-way” and EU lunacy such as diversity and identity politics, free movement of people, political convergence in Europe etc as the compromise they had to make for the Blair state’s largess. However, it is they who twenty years later, flush with full-time jobs, housing and pensions, divorce and adultery, have abandoned this socially engineered economic lunacy (hence Brexit). These largely well-heeled parents have given a thumb down to the over-engineered and ultimately flawed Euro and third-way solutions to the UK’s domestic social and economic issues. But not until after they have done, and continue to do, quite well from them!\nPerversely it is the young who continue to believe that they would have benefitted from remaining in the EU. They have also swallowed the whole free movement, political convergence, “identity politics” mumbo jumbo, hook line and sinker. Perhaps it’s a case of “if you say something often enough eventually people believe it”; particularly if you start saying it when they are children.\nSadly for us, we believe they have got the issues the wrong way around. They should, like their parents, accept and support Brexit but hold their parent’s generation to account for the lamentable state of their lives as well as the poor state of the real economy, housing and the job’s market. Inter-generational generosity and understanding and support is needed. A kind of truth and reconciliation between the generations!\nThe mental health crisis Mrs May is determined to tackle is a product of all that has gone wrong in the lives of the “snowflakes” over the last twenty years or so, mostly thanks to Blair and his naive “third way”; all that has gone wrong in the British economy and gone wrong in the EU……But sadly it’s going to take the next generation (the current 5-10 year-olds and a Blue Revolution to boot) to put it right.\n11.01.17 Anatomy of the economically engineered elite; or how people get stinking rich and how should a Blue Revolutionary react.\nWe all know how the bankers get rich, flogging “financial products” to people who all too often can’t afford them or don’t need them. The governments collude by manufacturing a housing crisis driving up private house building on the back of engineered social and moral decline (divorce and family breakdown) and “free movement of people”. We have explored the links between growth and housing in a previous blog so won’t go over it again here. However, a new house needs filling with stuff and this stuff is too often bought on credit so the bankers win this way too. The stuff that oils the wheels of this modern commerce is “confidence”. An economy based on confidence and debt certainly makes the planet sweat….as well as those of us unlucky enough to understand how it works only after it has broken us.\nAnother way the bankers and their hangers-on get rich is by the western world’s Quantitative Easing. In this simple scenario, Britain becomes a haven for foreign and British cash swilling around the world looking for a home (otherwise called an investment) and the banker’s trouser more cash. Others benefit too, like artists who can flog for millions of pounds an empty bed and some dirty knickers calling it “art”.\nThe creation of wealth owned by an array of celebrities, luvvies, sports personalities and retailers needs to be understood too because along with bankers these people are earning far more than is good for them….and us. But how does this work? Then we can move onto our old friends the “publicsectocracy”.\nIn simple terms, the inflationary pressures that normally increase prices when money is available in abundance (it might not feel like it is but trust me there is a lot of money around) doesn’t work because global low wage levels and low-interest rates ensure that prices don’t get hiked due to higher production costs for the stuff we buy. In this world of money filtering into the system from government debt plus our own “confidence based borrowing” people like Sir Philip Green can sell us stuff that costs him a fraction of what you have paid him to buy it. This foreign manufacturing and low-interest profit bonus is then neatly engineered to avoid tax in the UK. We might as well tip our personal debt and taxpayer’s money straight into the pockets of the Sir Philip Greens of the world. We use him as an example but it isn’t difficult to identify other rich people who get super wealthy from these “Disneyland” economics.\nother stuff that is financially engineered (apart from tax, debt and borrowing) are house prices and stocks and shares this is because house price inflation maintains the public’s appetite for, and ability to secure debt, and stocks and shares form the basis of most pensions…..a very worrying reality indeed.\nThat covers retail millionaires. However they are not the only people who get super rich (by which we mean rich beyond their actual economic or even moral worth), the next category and we do love these people because they are special….. are the celebrities, actors, TV presenters and sports stars. Their road to fame and for us more significantly, wealth is a different route to that of the retail giants above. these people are wealthy because someone thinks “they are worth it”. Ahhhh, love them!\nIn the old days and if you have watched the film “a bugs life” you will remember a wandering band of “entertainers”. This motley crowd of bugs and insects travelled from place to place entertaining communities. The life was precarious and the wages largely determined by the popularity of the group.\nThis description is similar to entertainers from the middle ages right through to the age of mass entertainment. You were worth what the public (or a patron) thought you were worth and that was reflected in how much they were prepared to pay to see you; buy your sheet music or gramophone record. I hope you would agree with us that there is a symmetry to this. The composer might get richer than the pianist in the local pub but it was a reflection of how many copies of sheet music they could sell that made them rich. Each purchase was a small part of a consumer’s income, but was affordable and added value to the consumer’s life through the pleasure of consuming the composer’s music.\nUnfortunately, there came a point when organisations like the BBC, ITV and now Amazon and others cease to be a mere conduit through which a “performer” offers their “talent” to a platform (Records, sheet music publishing, TV, RADIO, Internet) to entice people to buy, and became the mechanism via which the organisation tries to calculate a performers “popularity” and therefore their price. The organisation (the BBC or ITV, Fox, or Amazon) determines this price, a price the consumer has to pay for a Performer whether they like them or not. The consumer no longer really has an active role in the process.\nWe can hear voices crying out “but what is the alternative”. Well it isn’t going to be easy but one crude way would be for organisations like Broadcasters the FA and FIFA to set limits on wages and these must be realistic, accepted across “platforms” and whilst recognising talent these wages should not be so excessive that it penalises the consumer. In our “Bugs Life” example the consumer was king……not the performer!\nAn alternative might be to evolve some interactive functionality to enable popularity to be properly gauged so that performers are paid wages or fees based on their value to consumers as determined by the consumers themselves. The BBC could try this with BBC 3 for example. A sort of payment by results.\nIf you think about authors you get a better idea about what we are trying to achieve. An author writes a book. A publisher likes it and publishes it. This is like the BBC liking a performer and broadcasting them. However, the Publisher does not buy the book the public does and the wealth the author gets is directly linked to the number of books sold. We at a Blue Revolution have some people who have published….and no millionaires yet! With the broadcaster it is as though they say….”we will buy the books and make a disinterested readership pay because we can….they pay a licence fee”. So things need to change to make this economy in “talent” work for consumers and not just the “celebrities” they consume.\nFinally and possibly the most obscene of the stinking rich we come to our old enemy the “publicsectocracy”. These are the publicly funded and waged members of the public sector elite who have engineered their wages so far beyond what they are actually worth it’s almost a national embarrassment….not just a national disgrace. The newspapers occasionally refer to them and do a great naming and shaming exercise however nothing changes. The reason nothing changes is because the whole mechanism of government, state and the Public Sector works on the basis that wages equal talent. In government, state and the public sector, it is usually the opposite.\nThe slippery wage aspirational and entitled public sector “Chief” finds a safe and uncritical haven in the public sector. They can talk themselves and their “peers” up so that it becomes an established fact that to get the right person (like them) a particularly high wage must be paid. Often, however, they simply recycle themselves getting paid more and more as they incompetently perform in their job but competently climb the greasy pole of top public sector remuneration.\nSome organisations with the biggest budgets and their hands on the nations “balls” tend to rip the public off more than others. So in our rough rank order of theft by their “top people” from the working class tax payer we have ; the NHS, the Universities, “School Academy heads”, The Judiciary and QC’s, the Mandarin Civil Servants, the military and finally the chief execs of everything from local authorities to Housing Associations and Charities.\nTo put this right is relatively easy….the Government on behalf of the general public abandons bogus performance targets (the means by which these crooks get away with it) and freezes their wages. In addition, retire the many redundant people at the top and don’t replace them, and finally when posts become vacant offer a wage no higher than that of the Prime Minister. There will be takers, probably those who genuinely care about the organisation for whom they work and more importantly care about the people they serve and not the wages they get paid.\nOh and finally whilst not in the league of the super rich or the Publicsectorcrats, the Trades Unions Barons need a special mention. The workers should demand that they should loose their wages in line with the wages lost by striking workers, and there should be a ballot on how much they are paid.\nJeremy Corbyn’s jumped on this bandwagon recently with his typical student activist response to this problem. His solution is to cap wages and we presume he means private sector wages too. Apart from the public sector and his own wages as an MP which should be capped, this is Socialism at it’s worst. The private sector market in wages needs to be re-engineered so that the consumer has a far more accurate and active role in determining the level of wages for those they consume as performers and the rest of the wages market (finance, business etc) needs to subject itself to reform too. However, not at the point of wages and remuneration being fixed by the government but at the point where the consumer or the worker gets respectively either locked out of their role in the market or are exploited by their bosses. That fat bloke from Sports Direct springs to mind with this latter point.\n19.01.17 Bankers! Good or Bad?\nFrom the money lenders of Biblical times to the bankers of the Capitalist era Bankers have excited different emotions. The Jewish money lenders of the middle ages were persecuted when the feudal overlords, stricken just like the EU with a sclerotic economy failed to repay their debts and were, along with their families murdered, often horribly.\nTalking to radicals and “revolutionaries” on the left and right it is their lazy assumption that there is a Jewish conspiracy undermining the world and operating through the banking sector, controlled by powerful Jewish families. Being Blue revolutionaries we take the more sensible view that the bankers are like politicians driven by the desire to make money and the “system” has been engineered to deliver a now largely valueless profit. Not engineered by Jews but by politicians.\nIt is not a Jewish conspiracy but a banker/political collusion to deliver what both believe to be a ” positive social and economic good” otherwise known to politicians of a gullible stripe as economic “growth” and to the bankers, profit which translates into personal bonuses.\nWe as consumers, along with the politicians who liberalise the system, buy into the Alice in Wonderland guff. But let us be honest if you are a short-lived political gadfly, desperate to look competent and a banker tells you that they can magic up growth you are likely to be persuaded. This “growth” is preferential to even a short-term period of “economic stagnation” even if eventually “real growth started to re-establish itself. We only have to look at how the doom mongers would prefer decline post-Brexit. Economic decline is the post-Brexit narrative of choice for the elite, such is the power of stagnation or decline to manipulate opinion. However, as we have said before this banking manufactured “growth” is simply debt sometimes backed by property often backed by “consumer confidence”. The money going into the economy props up a service sector that needs money from any source to provide the jobs and the profitability the economy and the politicians need. Conspiracy no, bankers bad…..well no. Collusion …..well yes bankers good…..err no.\nBankers are simply the dung beetles of the modern free market, rolling up debt to make a profit. When we had real capitalism (and that era also had its problems) the banker incentivised effort and efficiency and thus drove economic activity and productivity. Rather than speculating and creating a kind of Oz-like “growth”, it would be better for people to borrow to invest in an actual productive activity otherwise known as “hard work” and for banks to only lend to those who wanted to drive growth by their hard work. Until the banking “emperor” is shown to have no clothes we will all go on borrowing and spending, the more extreme of us convincing ourselves that it really is all the fault of bankers and Jews and has nothing to do with us.\n20.01.17 The “Blue Revolution’s” analysis of that “great” Trump Speech!\nWe have a number of our own narcissists who, like all narcissists, want to be proven right. So we have unleashed the collective power of the Blue Revolution to both analyse the Trump Speech and to predict his likely success. The reason? So we can sit back in a year’s time and say, at least to anyone reading this, that “we told you so”.\nFirstly a declaration of interest; we supported Trump prior to the election and like Brexit felt that the alternative was too dire to contemplate. The prospect of an administration headed up by a Clinton with their politics of identity, politically correct waffle, and alienating class-based politics was taking the West nowhere good. Post Truth politics is the stock in trade of this group. They have prioritised their wealth and that of their class at any cost, to the detriment of millions of Americans. Now we have heard Trump’s 16-minute speech, which was basically a response to the hegemonic culture of the elite, what do we think?\nTrump sounds a bit light Blue RevolutionrY as he speaks with a transparent language heavy with meaning and lacking any flourish or nuance. He speaks to the constituency who have, as adults, been fired from “rust belt” industries as work went to China and who have seen their children promised education as a means of entering the establishment, whilst the elite close ranks to keep them out. Even in the U.S. a class culture excludes those who lack the …..well whatever it is!\nWhy the working class youth riot against Trump is not clear, perhaps they think that the Democratic party and its love in with bankers, millionaire business, political administrators, and their supposed liberal social policies will enhance their opportunities in life. In Marxian terms, they need their consciousness raising. The elite liberal state is undermining them, but unbeknown to them, they have been socially engineered to remain in a political stupor of liberal identity politics. The UK nearly became a cropper with this too in the Blair years. What worries us Blue Revolutionaries is that the rule of the liberal elite runs counter to the interests of the working classes. But too many of the working classes have been rendered incapable of recognising it, and can Trump do anything about it?\nWhat we heard when Trump was speaking was a man who has a simple business vision for an economy which has grown too complex as the world has impeded on it, through it and around it. We will come to economics later, however, some of Trumps promises will be in theory at least easier to deliver than others.\nShifting U.S. diplomacy away from the obsession with global intervention should be easy, but the Hawks in the GOP may not wish to see the corresponding reduction in military spending. Likewise, the idea of no longer demonising the Russians can only be positive but again the U.S. military machine has been geared up to operate on reductive polarities…since the end of WWII it has been a case of identifying the latest enemy, can Trump stop this pathological obsession.\nThe famous “wall” (“my wall, it’s a great wall, the best wall”) may possibly not happen either, the idea is a bit inflammatory and just like the hush-hush reality that the British economy has become over-dependent on migration (for all sorts of economic reasons), so it isn’t clear to us, to what extent the U.S. economy is the same. A wall may perversely be an adverse development for the U.S.\nFinally the pledge to effectively re-engineer the American working class using neo classical economics. This is a wholesale re-engineering of a class that has been forced into poverty and ignorance by decades of activity by the liberal elite. The unemployment, low wages, ignorance, loss of real Blue Collar work, the slide into divorce and debt has left a legacy of lawlessness and drug misuse that, as we have said previously, makes parts of western cities and particularly some U.S. cities look like microcosmic feudal fiefdoms. The reality for too many people is that these places are not safe spaces they are cruel depraved neighbourhoods where women and the vulnerable are abused and there are none of the freedoms associated with liberalism. The liberal elite has pulled out!\nWe believe this forgotten legacy of the liberal elite is too complicated for President Trump. Whilst he can talk about it, we can’t see how he can really do anything to change it. The causes are too complex to overturn in a generation whether it is the economy or society, and then there is the fact that his whole approach seems to be cast by him as Trump the billionaire patrician doing stuff for the poor. We at Blue Revolution take the view that the poor need to do stuff for themselves….and that includes getting into real politics. We can’t see Trump achieving that. Reclaim the streets with Trump’s assistance would be a better argument. As for the economics…well we take the view that any form of neo-classical economics unless deployed within a wealthy (not debt laden) closed economy achieves exactly the opposite of what Trump wants; it feeds the global markets and makes a hand-full of people very rich.\nSo in summary Trump offers an analysis of the consequences for America of the liberal elite’s sixty years in power. However, he goes little further than offering an analysis of the problems created by this power and its effects on America’s poor. He offers no actual programme of change. We didn’t hear any practical solutions. His analysis is also limited by the political, social and financial parameters associated with the hegemony he is so enthusiastic to criticise. For example, he says he will give power back to working class Americans….how exactly and did they ever have “power”! It took an eccentric using the language of Main Street to become president, but he is a billionaire!\nFinally Trump seems to us to have made an elemental business error; he has over promised and is almost certainly going to under-deliver. Perhaps being “Mr President” was his goal….not really sorting out America for the benefit of anyone but himself and his rich family. This would fit his psychological profile, at least according to some of us! We suspect that in four years time Trump will hear his own famous words delivered back to him by the American people…”You’re fired!\nDo we think the Blue Collar U.S. blue collar workers will be liberated by Trump? No, we don’t, but he is still a better bet than Clinton.\n21.01.17 The anxious foot soldiers of the illiberal elite take to the streets post Trump. What they really fear is a vision of a world post the Clinton’s V2\nThis as a brief post as we have been shocked by the riots in the U.S. and the demonstrations in Europe over Trump. The anxious footsoldiers of the illiberal elite clearly believe that Trump represents a shamelessly divisive and discriminatory perspective and will roll back decades of progress in respect of social integration and sexual equality. This is of course, as far as we are concerned, rubbish. The reason is that the U.S. is a democracy with a constitution that makes it impossible for Trump to deliver an agenda based on hatred or discrimination. He may send some reproductive rights back to the individual States but that is pretty much as far as he could go.\nWhat the foot soldiers of the illiberal elite are protesting about is that Clinton didn’t have an argument at the U.S. election and therefore lost. She and the elite demonstrated an absence of a so-called “liberal ideology” that takes America beyond the Clinton, Bush, Obama status quo. A status quo which has sucked up to amongst others the Saudi’s with their heroic record of women’s rights whilst turning on others no better but certainly no worse.\nThe foot soldiers of the elite don’t know who to blame for the mess America (and the EU)) is in. The wealth inequality, the celebrity culture, the banking crisis, social and moral decay etc. The foot soldiers can’t possibly blame themselves or the liberal elite who have helped them gain their individual personal identity and employed them in the government sector. All this whilst giving the blue collar workers the order of the boot as their jobs were exported abroad.\nSo they will blame Trump for…. well-being Trump, a seventy-year-old locker room jock with wandering hands, bad hair, cringeworthy chat up lines, and a self-important turn of phrase. In the overall scheme of things Trump probably comes in well ahead of Obama and Bush in the sexual preoccupation stakes……but well behind “old man” Clinton, the shaggers shagger.\nAs we posted yesterday Trump will, of course, be his own undoing. Which is sad. But it is unlikely to be a sexual impropriety that does for him.\n22.01.17 To understand “populism” where are the Anthropologists when you need them? Keeping schtum so as not to offend their academic masters. We step in to help\nWith all the wailing and gnashing of teeth going on around the world particularly among the “right on” classes and the elite we must ask the question; what exactly is “populism” and should we fear it or be inspired by it?\nIf we look at the rough history of populism it has overall been a force for good. Or so we think. If it hadn’t been for populism, we would probably never have shuffled any further than a few miles from the warmth of our fire and security of our cave. Populism back then would have been as seismic a shift as giving a driving licence and the full franchise to a Saudi woman today. Tribal society thrives on simple certainties.\nHowever, leaving the cave and fire via what was probably a popular uprising, whilst risky developed our brain and our capacity for more complex social and economic systems. And so it probably is with populism today.\nThe similarities between leaving the certainties of our past system don’t end with the “movement”, uprising or revolution, however. What comes next is critical as populism the “feeling” is probably more powerful that the “knowledge” about where we are going. In this respect, we believe Brexit has greater certainty than the Trump revolution. In America, people voted Trump as he presented himself as a beacon of positive change. However, no one really knows what the change is he proposes, except to make America great again whatever that means in a post-World War II globalised world.\nIn this sense, America has taken the same kind of “punt” that Germany took in 1933 or Russia in 1917. However, Trump is not a dictator nor could ever become one in the U.S. His election was, however, a lunge into a kind of uncertainty because the old ways were no longer working for the masses. The masses have left the fire and cave provided by the “liberal elite”; Hillary Clinton only managing to persuade those who ate at her table to remain faithful to her tribal cause. What is scary is that is over half the popular vote.\nSo populism can be very dangerous, very dangerous indeed as Russia and German in the early 20th century confirm; but in strong resilient democracies like Britain and the U.S., it is clearly time for populism to kick start the march to a better future, Even if with Trump that future is for the time being a bit unclear and sketched on the back of a fag packet.\n29.01.17 Do the baby boomers really “get” their responsibility for the current mess the young are in, and why don’t the young revolt.\nIf you are young and by young we mean under 30 you may ask yourself why the world is such a mess and why there is for you uncertainty at every social level, an uncertainty that exists irrespective of social class or wealth. We commented back in our early posts that uncertainty and contingency were the characteristics which defined mankind’s earliest iterations.\nSince the dawn of man, nervously blinking out of the pre-historic darkness trying to make sense of their consciousness and therefore their mortality, their fear and poverty, the human drive has been to improve their “lot”. The faith and cultures that mankind created were an attempt, all-to-often-short-term and bloody and self-defeating, to improve their tribal or national situation. The only justification for this brutality coming in the modern age by those who can see the benefits of social and economic progress over time.\nOthers however doggedly hold on to the idea that this progress (for example granting rights where they previously didn’t exist, putting an end to slavery) came at too high a cultural cost, namely that tribal or feudal systems were undermined.\nThis argument is of course, specious as there is no “culture” when a tribe is starving and the prospects of extinction are physical rather than merely cultural. Or alternatively, your “culture” renders disagreement with authority a capital offence. So to the ill-informed “youth” and the army of culturally confused “lefties and liberals”, we say stop idealising simple or brutal systems and imagine what it was, or in Saudi Arabia, is like, living under one of these systems.Particularly if you are female.\nHowever, while we don’t sympathise with the young on their view that global economic progress is bad, we do take a rather more negative view about their parents and grandparents responsibility for the personal challenges, uncertainties and the “social and economic sump” into which too many young people have been dumped.\nThis responsibility for the mess of the modern world is down to the “post-war liberal elite” and its aiders and abetters the army of “baby boomers”, the youngest of whom are now in their mid 40’s. This is something which the young don’t seem to recognise. It is something they seem unwilling to acknowledge. We want to know why!\nOf course, this “denial” by the young is like everything else in the west in part “engineered” by the liberal left elite who have the most to loose from a sudden awakening by the western world’s young that the progress of previous generations whilst bloody and incompetent was at least an attempt to create a better world for them. Contrast this with our present situation which is intended to be a consolidation for the middle-aged, middle class rather than progress for the young and poor. The poor came through for the seemingly well-meaning but totally bonkers Trump, the young stuck with Clinton. Why?\nWe believe with the western world today and its culture of “Secularwesternism” it is the first time in modern history that an older generation is determined to look after itself at the expense of its young and indeed the whole planet. But why are the young so impervious to this reality and what might be the consequences for liberal culture once the elite has destroyed it with their greed, hubris and stupidity?\nIt really is not fair to be too critical of the young. They have been fed a line since the mid-1990’s that the education system has been engineered for them. The abolition of Grammars has created opportunities, the emphasis on higher education has “raised the bar” along with access via student loans. Finally demanding education from employers for employees aged 16 to 18 has closed any gaps and skills shortages. Add to this the ridiculous “gifted and talented” programme of the early 2000’s and an emphasis by the millennial Blair government that it was cool to be young, cool to snog, cool to “get off with each other”.\nThe millennium decade was a period when “right on” adults tried to define a great future for the cool Britannia generation. This generation has come to maturity with a lot of mind shaping having gone most of it almost subliminally. Their thoughts then find expression in the one thought at a time Facebook post.\nAs far as we are concerned the reality is very different. The abolition of Grammars has denied the most academic working class children a chance to enter the establishment via the top universities. The proliferation of higher education courses paid for by student debt has kept academics in work whilst young people get often useless qualifications gaining no ability to think beyond a kind of cultural “group think”.\nThe conversion to “academic” courses from the impossible to arrange apprenticeships in the 2000’s resulted in young people becoming unskilled to do anything, hence immigration to fill the skills gap.\nThe parents, unaware of the left’s agenda encouraged their children’s indebtedness; “S/he’s the first to go to university” was a proud refrain in working class homes up and down the country.\nWe have described this as a bit of a left wing stitch up of the young. Maybe it was deliberate; an attempt to keep the left’s most loyal foot soldiers, the humanities academics in work. Maybe it was simple incompetence like much of “new Labour” policy.\nSo to address the question above; why don’t the young complain about the baby boomers outrageous snatch on their future. The simple answer is because they can’t. They can no more think in these terms with sufficient sophistication to argue their case than they can step outside of the group think of “identity politics” or tear themselves away from the narcissism of Facebook. We have a new feudal system called a “publicsectocracy” if you will, and the young are unfortunately its serfs.\nSome young people might be able to see the need to join us at a Blue Revolution. Most will simply fail to see that there is a problem.\nAnd finally what will be left when the elite have destroyed liberalism. Well, the elite are lining their own kids up to replace them at the top of the cultural and political pile, as there is little real talent or appetite for power further down. This almost feudal arrangement will be benign until the ignorance and aggression of the poor render the elite impatient to consolidate what has become their “dirty secret”; that they don’t like, trust or respect the people they are, for them unfortunately, still being paid to serve…….us!\n09.02.17 Gender fluidity a gift from Daddy! What does this actually mean to the girl or boy involved?\nA popular British ‘Marxist’ comedian has indicated that he would like his newborn daughter to have none of the pressure associated with the whole business of gender…that whole business of each of us having different “farm parts” determined by our gender.\nBut isn’t the real issue not the difference between a male and female person’s “farm parts” but what they do with them. If you simply talk about gender as being “fluid” you will encourage confusion, uncertainty and distress. A child has a right to know what it is not, so as it matures it is capable of deciding who it is. Can you imagine the confusion a child will face when asking “daddy what sex” am I and our “right on daddy” says “I don’t know and I don’t care….you can be either or neither it is up to you”.\nHowever, even if you rely on a lazy analysis of past and current social norms then you have an argument which has some validity and social value. You can with this approach ascribe a gender to your child but then say “whilst girls usually wear pink and like kittens and boys wear blue and play conkers (cultural reference alert) it doesn’t have to be like that”.\nBeing the kind of guys and gals we are, we would like to add a further dimension to this perplexing gender debate. A Marxian perspective if you like. Gender is only really relevant in the modern economy for one reason and that is that it determines the type of consumption which typically can be targetted at you. Consumption patterns are something you can change. A simple choice anyone can make to buy or not buy on the basis of gender-related marketing.\nUnfortunately, there are legacy issues linked to gender which remain more significant than mere gender-related consumption, these relate to biology but are combined with essentially tribal social values and still affect male and female roles today.\nGender is still used by many to determine their primitive biological roles and “priorities”. In the past, there was no choice about the role of impregnator or impregnated. These reproductive gender roles are today choices and, take place within a modern gender fluid western society.\nWestern society has many flaws, but it has strengths as well. Aside from gender-related consumption choices, reproduction has become a legitimate “choice” for western women and couples. However, in the west, too many reproductive choices are actually a massive welfare liability, which is why tribes strictly control reproduction. The word liability applies because in the west far too many reproductive decisions fail to take account of the need to raise children. Too few take our primitive roles seriously anymore and the taxpayer picks up the tag for children who no one really wants to raise, gendered or otherwise. Contrast this with third world economies where gender is taken very seriously and upon which different rights and social roles apply to men and women.\nSo gender fluidity in a gender-ambivalent and reproductively amoral society is unnecessary. No one has to buy what is ascribed to their gender nor behave in the traditional way expected of their gender, and sire or carry and bear babies unless they want to. If they do thoughtlessly the responsibility will ultimately fall to the taxpayer.\nThe issue, therefore, isn’t what gender you are or are not, but what you do with your gender or you don’t do with it. Please, someone, tell daddy.\n09.02.17 Following on from “populism” and the rise of a people’s agenda we ask, why can’t the left and the liberal elite compete with populism?\nIt must be something to do with the march of history. The people are better placed than the experts to ensure the survival of their culture. The elite and the left united it seems to us in one simple belief that they should guide the masses towards a future defined and shaped by them; with their preoccupations and concerns the focal point for the policies that supposedly steer the interests of the masses. This creates a roughly 50:50 split between the people (the masses) and the combined establishment.\nThe problem is that the masses; that unpredictable and often violently revolutionary mob no longer see the link between the values of the left or the elite and their own basic needs, considerations and concerns. We believe that this has a lot to do with the fact that the left and the liberal elite have something that the masses can no longer enjoy and that is personal security. The left are too prone to lionise the role of the state as some kind of paternalistic protector of the masses, whilst the liberal elite are more than happy to engineer an economic “success” which casts jobs into off-shore oblivion whilst replacing real jobs with state non-jobs and an education system which metastases stupidity at every level below that of the elite itself.\nWe thus see the masses trapped between a “benign” authoritarianism which taxes and spends to preserve itself whilst destroying creativity, industry and ambition or as an alternative, a liberal “third way culture” which promotes “free market” principles which offer zero hours contracts, an economy dependent on the toxicity of debt, plus any one of a number of means of maintaining the aggregate demand, the means by which the elites measure their political success. It doesn’t matter to them if the state apparatus has over-reached itself and this has resulted in abandoned elderly, poor education, student debt and a squandering of the planet’s resources.\nFor both the left and the elite the world’s poor are migrating because they are locked out of growth at home be it North Africa or Asia, but as long as they the elite can see “growth” at home they fudge the issue; none more so than the EU.\nPopulism then in our opinion could be much greater than the roughly 50:50 split so far identified. As long as the next “revolution” is predicated on the principles of Contract, Choice and Concent and this supports democracy and freedom giving rise to a fairness in the distribution of power and wealth, we can’t see either the liberal elite of the left having much to offer. The evidence for this seems to be starting to take hold with Clinton’s lukewarm support in the US and Corbyn’s in the UK. We just need to light the Blue touchpaper and stand back.\n11.02.17 The London and south east effect and the myth of its transferability.\nIf you lived in London in the 1950’s or early 1960’s you would not recognise the place today. Of course, some landmarks will prevail for centuries but the rest of the city morphs and changes year in and year out. Where the small towns of the north remain stable or in a sort of genteel decline the big three English cities evolve, and the really big daddy of the process is London.\nSince 1960 London and the other two big English cities (Birmingham and Manchester) have lost huge manufacturing and other big industries and these have been replaced by the high-tech and service industries, we describe as “the real economy” today. It is this economic change which has changed the character of the big cities. With the decline of an “industrial” working class and an imperceptible shift from production to debt backed consumption as the basis of the cities regional economy, the world has been knocking on the cities doors.\nWe believe that the what has altered the city economy has been the success of globalisation. Globalisation has created “global” industries which require a global workforce which is mobile and able to adapt to changes in climate and culture. Around this phenomenon has sprung up the global citizen, the character that is so beloved of the liberal elite and in the Uk those who wish to remain within the EU.\nHowever, globalisation may benefit I.T. Banking and other high skill sectors which push beyond the UK for a workforce a kind of petit-bourgeois workforce, but to service, this phenomenon of a global petit-bourgeois workforce the unskilled are also required and none are more adaptable than the global proletariat. They come to the UK and share houses and live a life far removed from their lives at home wherever they come from (eastern Europe, East Africa or the Philippines). They fit into the city-state because they have none of the pre-occupations and hang-ups that in the UK our own “proletariat” have been conditioned to obsess about. These include health care for the deliberately unhealthy, welfare and perhaps a two or three bedroom home provided for them, and paid for by the state, so they can bring up their fatherless/motherless child in an isolated and lonely comfort their limited economic worth could not possibly pay for. There is even an unwillingness to move from a declining location to secure employment in another more prosperous location leaving the way wide open for the global proletariat to step in.\nThe wider British economy, is therefore made to contort itself with state (taxpayer?) debt so it can provide health, welfare and meet regional housing expectations based on a model that exists only in the provinces with their old and all too often under-employable second generation ex-industrial workforce. This model has since the 1960’s been largely abandoned by the city-state as a result of global conditions.\nSo is this “city-state” model transferable? In short, we believe not. To accommodate the needs of the provinces the economic expectations need to become more realistic. It is not possible to create a local economy based on the city-state model without unnecessary mass housing and an economic infrastructure that not only provides services but provides jobs and accommodation relevant to the needs of the individual worker. The provinces are not like a city-state, they can’t provide the well-paid jobs that create the trickle down economy. They would simply become areas with over-stretched social resources (schools, health etc) which remain highly dependent on “top up” welfare for a migrant population that can neither be effectively housed or effectively employed.\nThe answer is to stop welfare for all new migrants and get the provinces working again. It sounds like an unappealing solution but trust us if engineered properly it will transform Britain without trying to make Grimsby, Greater London.\n14.02 17 First version The Blue Revolution Manifesto\nIntroduction\nThe world goes through revolutionary upheavals every hundred years or so and semi-revolutions every half century. The last one in the UK was in 1997 when Tony Blair acquired the mandate to secure the state’s total moral and social dominion over its people. In the U.S. Clinton achieved the same thing. The whole “third way” was based on the idea that the intellectual elite knew better that the public what was good for them. To avoid this process of change being merely “utopian” i.e. just aspirational froth, the left wing liberal elite knew that there would have to be some underpinning economic model that could funnel funds into the projects that would save the people from themselves and deliver Blair and Clinton’s New Jerusalem. They believed it would work.\nThe economic model chosen was one where Government spending would be deployed to boost economic growth and thisin turn it was believed would empower people to achieve their potential. The era of naïve economics and identity politics was born, to a fanfare of “things can only get better” by D:Ream.\nThe public were in part seduced by this model. Blair seemed like a nice guy – and who could argue that in the UK public expenditure was there to be spent on health, welfare, and achieving via every public-sector outlet, the vision of a multi-coloured kaleidoscopic Great Britain; a Britain shorn of reactionary forces like national pride, belief in the family, and personal responsibility. Who needs that stuff when the state is there to go beyond intervening from the cradle to the grave and can now usefully occupy itself interfering with the public’s mind too? These old ideas thought the new left would be consigned to the dustbin of history, just as surely as bonded serfdom and illiteracy had been.\nThe only problem was that the economics didn’t really stack up if you knew what was really going on. So along with the Financial Crisis of 2007/8 the other consequences of this utterly naïve model have been expanding wealth inequality and the inability of the state to make good its 1997 promises (regardless of who is in power) and a growing burden on the taxpayers of the present and future to pay to keep this whole shambolic system in existence.\nThis misfiring model is what we at a Blue Revolution call the Secular Western hegemony or more simply “secular westernism”. This secular western model is well established and will need a new revolution to shift it. Not a Red Revolution because Red Revolutions are, like the Red Revolutions in China and Russia or indeed the UK after World War II, effectively a triumph of the state over the individual, albeit with an initially benign intention.\nA revolution will be needed because just like the aristocrats in the past, the modern big winners of the state system, the politicians, bureaucrats, charity chiefs, and third sector organisations, the publicsectocracy as we call them, won’t want to give up the power, status and wealth that goes with their elevated positions. They also will not want to re-order the economy to reduce the super-rich who benchmark “top” wages and provide funding and sponsorship for elite causes including politics.\nIf you believe that today government, democracy, welfare, international relations and basic rights don’t pass the sniff test, you may be feeling the initial stirrings of becoming a Blue Revolutionary. So Please read on.\nBlue Revolution\nNewcastle-Under-Lyme\nDecember 31st 2016\nThe rest has been removed for hard copy publication.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-riddle-of-history-solved-we-examine-the-history-power/content_140.html": "The ‘Riddle of History solved’?- We examine the history of power.\nThe ‘riddle of history solved’ is relatively easy to explain. It is basically why so many people create economic value but so few people ever get to control it. From the moment we had more than we needed to survive as small tribes, systems of authority have sprung up to control surplus value and those authorities have controlled people. Whether it is the proto-feudalism of the Pharaohs or the early Kingdom of Israel or Muhammad’s Muslim Empire ordinary people has been subject to the violent rule of the minority. Religion playing the role of defending the social and economic reality for all involved.\nThe political ‘Right’ claim that the capitalist model delivers a greater equality. Certainly, in destroying feudalism it put an end to control and servitude for workers by those of superior status, the nobility, but in its place, we gained a more mobile and ever-changing hierarchy of capitalists and their political servants in parliament ‘contracting’ to undermine the rights of workers. Socialism was a reaction to this capitalist exploitation. It sought to control capitalism and redistribute capitalist wealth in the ‘name’ of the workers. Wherever socialism was introduced however it only ever acted in the name of the workers’ apart from the brief period between 1945 and 1970 in the UK when it did serve the social as opposed to economic interests of the workers. After 1970 it ceased serving anyone’s interests other than the State itself. As the ‘socialists’ have always put it the workers were ‘exploited’ by the ‘bourgeoise’ or capitalists as they are now better known (see Opinion 11/02/2018) so the States job was to exploit them back.\nIn its defence, capitalism did create lasting legal principles such as contract, choice and consent which as Karl Marx anticipated have ‘taken on a social character’ and have become an expectation of working people the western world over. Preserving these values is now a revolutionary act in the face of the counter-revolutions being waged by the forces of the ideology of Islam, the corrosive effects of crony capitalism and the confused ideology of twenty-first century socialism shorn of its economic role to exploit capitalism in the name of workers and now neurotically fretting about ‘identity’ as though a collection of militant groups is a substitute for a revolutionary working class.\nSo the ‘Right’ is not right in thinking that ‘capitalism’ is fair… it’s not it needs regulation. But the left is wrong to think that capitalism is so wrong it needs exploitation by the State. Exploitation of capitalism by the State on ‘behalf’ of the workers has simply created an unaccountable class of State bureaucrats who no longer exploit the capitalists to pay for the State but exploit the workers to pay for it instead. This is therefore why the Left can’t be ‘left’…because it is now hell-bent on exploiting the workers through taxation and debt and the right isn’t right because capitalism is incapable of acting fairly and will always seek to exploit workers and always with the connivance of the State, even a left-wing State. Hence the Blair/Clinton/EU obsession with supporting crony capitalism.\nThe State is not the Nation the people are and they need to secure in perpetuity for our daughters and sons the values of contract, choice and consent and take over the running of the Nation from either an ideological ‘left’ or ideological ‘right’ State. Getting rid of the power of ideology is clearly the place to start particularly with the ideology of Islam trying to colonise both the left and the right!!",

It is an essential pre-requisite in establishing, and maintaining, Britain’s future on the world scene. We do not believe that education is about employment but is about life choices beginning with the choice by parents to have children in the first place.\n‘Education for education’s sake’ must become a central tenet of educational policy. Thus, the essence of Blue Revolution’s educational policy, as an acknowledgement that every ‘learner’ in our society should have numerous affordable education pathways to provide opportunities for a fulfilling lifetime of learning which is both social and economic in character. Education is a human right; not something which should be a burden on the state or individual. As such, there are some essential principles which we would like to see reflected in education which are based on a contract between the people and a people’s state. They are as follows:\n- A move towards a broad, diversified and inclusive National Curriculum which takes learning beyond the basic subjects\n- The abolition of imposed selection or pressured direction within the education system. This will enable the student at any age to demonstrate choice on what they study and when they study it.\n- Free access to education at any age.\n- Create a universally accepted view that vocational and academic routes to learning are of equal esteem. Eradicate the stigma of not going to University and remove the disproportionate economic advantage associated with the private schools and top universities.\n- With all the above in mind reduce the school leaving age to 15 which is year 10, for those with a minimum standard of literacy and a guaranteed contract of two years employment.\nSummary\nEducation is vital to the nation’s well-being.

All different but all united in one belief; its all about them!\nCelebrities, those ubiquitous individuals who before mass communication would have had the status accorded to the manager of the local picture house or the dance hall now straddle the internet peddling themselves as gurus on every subject from politics to health and well being. The interesting thing about “Slebs” or we suppose “performers” of all kinds is that in terms of a Blue Revolution they have carved out a little niche puling in cash from those who can ill afford to waste it. Bankers get hammered but no one looks at the amount of wealth that the poor manufacture and which ends up in the hands of the celebrities who grace the pages of gossip magazines.\nModern Celebrities are numerous and their wealth is grossly disproportionate to their worth. In both economic and social terms the legacy they leave is of little real value but they seem to get wealthy irrespective of this. This process of poor people (via earnings, borrowings and welfare) creating a largely valueless class of “Slebs” is the result of a system that we call “Debtamorphosis”. The mechanism is complex but essentially promoters, commercial TV companies, the internet and newspapers promote these “Slebs” and then advertisers get involved so that a past worthwhile exemplar of good pro social values like a sports personality evolves into a showperson demonstrating personal excess, worth below value and tackiness. The arrogance of these people is what drives their own self promotion and makes them notable and deserving, for them, of more self promotion.\nThe lofty left-wing luvvie may look down their nose at the Katie Price end of the “Sleb” market but the fact that it is Public Broadcasters and Cinema production companies plus glossy magazines managing the promotion process does take the tackiness out of the “debtamorphosis” for them. They are more gilded but non the less still of much lower value than their worth what ever they may think. It doesn’t matter though because being on the telly and rich and famous is all about them; we just pay to keep them there.\nDoctors too have displayed a worrying lack of personal awareness in respect of the wealth they believe they are entitled to. Ideologically the west is sick morally and economically, thus in terms of social justice there seems little case for paying public workers too much tax and gov’t borrowing. Doctors parade around TV studios demonstrating emotions ranging from simple pleading to passive aggression to classic “God complex” narcissism. These well paid and more importantly well respected public employees are making people suffer in pain and putting them at risk of harm in their morally bankrupt campaign to avoid loosing the cachet of earning more money on a Saturday. Again with the Government replacing the Gossip or the Glossy magazine the taxpaying poor and middle earners have to pick up the tab for a profession that hasn’t really done what it says on the tin since the 1970’s. But of course the strike is all about them rather than the tax paying patient; we just pay to keep them in work and happy.\nFinally the underclass. The victims of the “system”. A system that allows fornication on an industrial scale with the all to obvious by product of welfare sired fatherless babies. Sex has become an entitlement that can no longer just be the pleasure enjoyed by people who have embarked on responsible mature and socially valuable course of action; making a public commitment to each other. The multiple fathers with a community “harem” of “baby mothers” are simply a drain on western economies as are the baby mothers them selves. The limited social value delivered by these people is propped up by a drained and depleted economy and of course the lifestyle they enjoy is dependent for its survival on welfare. Welfare of course can’t be made to work against the narcissistic interests of large numbers of this this particular group…….because welfare is after all….. all about them. We just pay to keep them happy and sha****g.\n03.05.16 We are all angry now. Or at least dissatisfied. Why? And what is the solution if it isn’t going to be religious or ideological regression.\nThe public in the western world slides “left” or “right” depending on whether they identify the problems that affect them or make them insecure as being caused by foreigners (right) or bankers and the “system” (left). Outside the west the faith nations become more intransigent about the important role of their faith in civil and political society. These political and religious regressions are caused by a suspicion about the effects of other cultures and ideologies on the community that sees itself under threat; be it the US or Saudi Arabia. Some cultures try to export their “faith” through a combination of persuasion and soft power. Others try through force.\nThe world of “Secular Westernism” is economically indebted and socially insecure and this trickles down to populations who either directly experience the indebtedness and insecurity or are trapped in welfare the new “Opium of the people”. Government borrowing to pay welfare, to protect their populations from the realities of personal debt and insecurity (and to maintain consumption, the modern proxy for an economy) is at best a short term but unaffordable strategy. The system will collapse under the weight of its contradictions; namely the sheer unaffordability of the state taking more and more of the social and economic strain.\nWith “debtamorphosis” the economic winners are only winning at the expense of the indebted masses (all property is debt!) and unfortunately welfare arrangements whilst reinforcing dependence on the state also encourage divorce and other social ills that require a state response. This is unfortunately a phenomenon most marked amongst the less well educated and less economically versatile. Karl Marx would not have recognised “justice” in the welfare system of Britain and much of Europe, he would probably have thought recipients were some kind of under financed aristocracy living idly off the value created by others. He would have been half right. However what keeps public sector workers and the welfare dependent in money isn’t value; as we have said many times, it’s debt!\nIn the non westernised countries the fear of this contagion spreading and undermining society by undermining social norms is getting acute. Women are being systematically repressed to “protect” them and society from secular westernism’s at best amoral influence. It can be seen in the UK and Europe within largely Islamic communities. A return to strict religious norms; gender specific, male in origin and based on submission to God. The fear the western nations have is due to the limit on personal rights that go with this religious conservatism.\nSo peeping over the parapet we have a socially liberal but largely economically and socially bankrupt western world being held together by bureaucracies like the EU and the US federal Government. These organisations are blind as to how to manage the social decay their debt burdened societies have created. However they fear simple “faith based solutions as these curtail liberty and freedom which drives the debt based market economies.\nOn the other hand there are the oil rich Islamic nations together with fundamentalist tribal economies see this western world as promoting vice and social insecurity. Both of course are right. The west is bankrupt and has through retreating from Christian morality allowed its nations to become both free and immoral. The secular left however are right too that tribal and repressive religious regimes are unlikely to deliver freedom and democracy or protect the rights of others in the way secular westernism can.\nSo what is the solution. Well here at a Blue revolution we take the view that the only things that matter are human relationships and these have to be based on Capitalisms legacy a model of “justice” based on Contract, Choice and Consent. Based on the three C’s, relationships between people their governments and the means by which those relationships freely entered into, drive the economy, will preserve rights and promote the production of social and economic value.\nTherefore we say there will be no great technological advances emanating from tribal or feudal Islamic countries any time soon; unless it is a weapon of course. But unless the west stops sponsoring greed and stupidity the legacy of Capitalism in negating the abuses of tribalism and feudalism through the promotion of Contract, Choice and Consent our progress will be wasted.\nWe will leave you to fill in the gaps!!\n07.05.16 Sadiq Khan the most powrful Muslim in the western world. Can he help to build an accord between Islam and the West. We hope so.\nWe had no view about the outcome of the London Mayoral election. Let the people decide! We believe that when presented with the facts the people know best. Unlike the bureaucratic left who see the people as needing visionaries and a vanguard to lead them, we believe the people should be trusted; the problem is we are not trusted enough.\nHowever in respect of the London election we think the choice is cautiously the correct one. Mr Khan seems to be a modern liberal with progressive instincts who identifies himself with a simple faith based culture in the form of Islam. Mr Knan needs to use his power and influence to achieve some radical outcomes for the faith he rightly promotes if nothing else to start its slow reformation.\nHe needs to begin by asking some very basic questions of his western liberal friends and those closer to his faith. For the reader these are the Blue Revolution secular western/Islamic accord questions that not only need to be asked, but also need a progressive answer and solution.\nWhy is it the common perception that Islam is preoccupied with gender stereotyping and hung up about sexuality? How can this be addressed by Mr Khan to make the public perception of Islam less of a rub with secular western liberalism and thus become more progressive as a faith?\nWhy is the common perception that authority in Islam comes from God but via men in authority; either religious leaders or male heads of households? How can Mr Khan offer a more progressive interpretation of authority within Islam that looks modern and less discriminating against women.\nHow can Mr Khan help the secular west to identify its problems as largely due to a diet of debt which props up a consumer culture that promotes “immoral behaviour” whilst hiding the truth of the wests economic weakness and vulnerability?\nMr Khan can use his high profile office and become a visionary for Westio-Islamic cooperation and understanding. Or he will slide into paralysis not knowing which side of the moral divide to safely locate himself. He was elected yesterday. We await with his first 100 days with interest and anticipation and we hope this post helps.\n07.05.16 Debtamorphosis in action. Turning Student debt misery into jobs for the university class of liberal left academics. How ‘just’ is that?\nSomeone on the British television news today was speaking about how EU migrants put money into the British economy by paying their taxes. The assumption was that somewhere there was a pool of actual value from which the nations wage bill is paid. Actual value is national income based on food production, manufacturing and the extractive industries. Exports bring in wealth when the importing countries also have value with which they pay for their imports. The point is these can’t be debt based economies.\nNow this situation doesn’t really exist in the west any more. Migrants like the indigenous population have their wages either paid or subsidised by the government. The government in turn does not have access to real economic value it is forced by the legacy of the post war welfare settlement to make good economic shortcomings by putting the economy into debt. House prise inflation opens up opportunities for homeowners to borrow too. All this borrowing funds consumption and leaves the Government believing that it is in receipt of taxation based on value rather than taxation based on government and individual debt. The recipients of the debt based expenditure become wealthy and this process we call debtamorphosis. Debtamorphosis is the mechanism by which the public sector workers and certain businesses in the service and consumer sector create personal wealth out of other peoples debt. There is no better example of this than student loans.\nFrom the moment the new labour government started to fetishize higher education and expanded the sector beyond what could realistically be afforded by the government, students began to gain first hand experience of the debtamorphosis mechanism. Students borrow thousands of pounds to buy an often pointless degree whilst paying the salaries of lecturers and academics. These academics are recipients of the debt of the students in the same way that those who borrow against their home to pay for popular consumables create retail millionaires. The government doesn’t take the debt directly from the indebted but it skims the debt from the recipients of the debt based wealth in the form of taxation.\nThe phrase we have coined as a corruption of Karl Marx’s “all property is theft” is “all property is debt”. This is the reality of western economies. Having wealth in the economy based on debt and welfare unfortunately leads to social and economic decline. The answer is not more debt but considerably less debt and if this makes the economy appear to shrink, this is as much an illusion as the economies apparent growth. With debt based wealth driving economic growth the economy isn’t really growing it just appears to be so. Are you paying attention George?\n10.05.16 Spies, bankers, politicians and military types all support the EU. Why? Because they are all bureaucrats and it is a bureaucracy.\nThis isn’t going to be a lengthy post; there isn’t much more to say. The world needs less, not more bureaucracy. For countries to grow in understanding and peace relationships between people, communities and nations need to be based on simple principles. We say relationships should be based on Contract Choice and Consent, upon which freedom and democracy will eventually evolve even in the most resistant environments.\nBureaucracy like the EU is an interference with this process of evolutionary human development; but lots of people are well paid to be bureaucrats (the publicsectocracy as we call them) and need to do the bidding of the establishments who pay their wages. So when called upon to enter the fray by say the British Prime Minister or Chancellor they do so willingly, even though they know that what their organisations do will still be done because the public rather than the bureaucracy will demand from them “business as usual”.\n10.05.16 For decades secular westernism was an ideology in search of a personality, Blair, Clinton etc. Now we have Trump, Saunders and Corbyn et al will there be a change of tack.\nOk lets look at this question; it is a little more complex than it first appears. Secular Westernism is the name we at a Blue revolution have given to what has become the prevailing western ideology. It therefore contrasts with other ideologies such as communism and Islamism. Whilst it is an ideology based on some good stuff; freedom, equality, democracy it has, possibly as a result of empowering people who can then make mistakes, gained a reputation for some high value negatives such as economic decline and high levels of social decay, characterised by debt funded consumerism, decline of collective moral behaviour i.e. divorce, illegitimate births, idleness, etc.\nNow it would be stupid to argue that some people don’t do well in a secular western society. Businesses that cater for consumers, banks that offer debt and public sector employees who don’t directly assist people but manage those who do could all be classed as the winners along with those who exist on the froth of the system such as celebrities and personalities, footballers, pop idols and models and those in the media up to and including “top thesps”.\nThe secular western culture evolved in the 1980’s as a response to declining competitiveness amongst mature western economies such as Europe and the US. In the west heavy industry, like ship building was going elsewhere and coal mining was no longer commercially viable in a global market. The response was to look at how the economic paradigm could be re configured to ensure longer term viability of the free market and the continued accumulation of wealth by the few. These people suck the body liquor off the corpse of the western economy; Ad men and those pandering to consumerism for example.\nA reconfiguration was achieved in two ways. Firstly workers within an economy had to shift away from the notion of production as the main economic and wealth creating function and embrace consumption and the public sector as the main economic activities. Secondly to finance the consumption the publics tolerance of debt (both their own and government) had to increase, and student debt is one manifestation of this process. The final element of this process and the one that toxified the whole system was the opening up of the Chinese proletariat to the production of western goods.\nMrs Thatcher is often credited with being the architect on the European side of the pond at least, of this change from production to consumption as the main economic preoccupation. In the US it was good old Ronnie Regan. Both of these leaders had no real grasp of the economic and moral outcomes of this combination of changes. However the short term benefits were apparent to anyone who understood the wealth creating opportunities within the new economic paradigm. Thatcher and Regan were therefore the cheerleaders of the birth of Secular Westernism. They were two people who saw wealth creation for the few rather than value creation for the many as the new purpose of the western economy.\nWere they really blind to the need for real economic growth to come through the production of social and economic value? Who knows….who cares!\nAnyway it was the beginning of the new western paradigm. No longer based on Christian moral values of self discipline, self restraint, hard work, the family and so on and so forth. This new paradigm, debt based and with “freedom” at its empty heart created a number of offspring which continue to protect and finance the paradigm, offspring such as un sustainable stock and house price inflation, a crazy “art” market, zero interest rates, and National Lotteries. In essence we have had the Banking crisis….a secular western phenomenon, social decay, a secular western phenomenon, consumerism, a secular western phenomenon, debt based wealth creating millionaires, a secular western phenomenon, and the hostility from “faith cultures” a secular western phenomenon. Secular westernism whilst having some good bits is not wholesome enough to avoid all these shortcomings.\nTo maintain this model it needed a new cheerleader after the “housewife” Thatcher and her US consort Regan had left office. In the UK at least there was an interregnum with John Major. A decent working class man who understood “real economics” as anyone south of the middle class does. (It is a pity he lets his post war, lower middle class anxieties persuade him of the virtue of the EU…however he is a good man). The John Major phenomenon…Gray…peas on a knife, shirt in underpants provided a simple but effective caricature to the new elite of someone who wasn’t “secular western” or at least not secular western enough. These people were chippy, privately educated wealth and fame hungry elites into who’s fold emerged the cheerleaders of the late 1990’s and 2000’s. In the UK Tony Blair and in the US “shagger” Clintstone.\nOnce these two “great guys” came along the paradigm was crystallised so that in later years Bush and his debt based wars and Brown and his UK banking crisis were mere interruptions to the programme of debt based economic “growth” all at the cost of government financed social and economic decline.\nAfter Blair and Brown we got Cameron and Wizard Osborne of the emerald city of debt. These people are the new “personalities” who the brokers and cheerleaders of Secular Westernism promote. The public instinctively knows the paradigm is broke; even Russell Brand knows it but they don’t know why and therefore don’t have an answer.\nSo to go back to the original question; do we think that the cheerleaders of Secular Westernism need to change tack in the face of growing public disapproval of another Clinton in the U.S. or Osborne as leader of Britain’s Tories The new kids on the block are Corbyn, Trump, Saunders and the toddlers of anti-austerity?\nWe are sorry to say the answer is no there is no need to change tack. The Secular Western paradigm has nothing to worry about, these people are the new “personalities”. Secular westernism has two interconnected but distinct sides; the economic and the social. Whilst the Clintons and Osborn emphasise the advantage of debt in creating “growth” the left and the toddlers of anti austerity emphasise the advantages of debt in solving social problems like unemployment which they believe is caused by “capitalism”, both call it “investment” rather than waste…..which is what it is.\nBoth sides are doing little more than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic of the western economy. We know it and think you should know it too.\n19.05.16 Ideas are easily made toxic when not exposed to challenge. Trade is an effective conduit for challenge.\nNo Narrative exists\n19.05.16 The Queens speech is about prison reform. How will this help in a country of economic and moral confusion.?\nGiving Governor’s more power over their jails seems to be the current big idea for cutting crime. We have some occasional contributors who know a little bit about this subject so we have sought views. The first view seems to be that whilst this will or rather may reduce costs it is unlikely to reduce crime. Maybe the government knows this maybe it is a kind of virtue signalling where the government claims to have lofty ideals but in reality knows that getting Governors to take the financial responsibility for jails means the costs can be forced down. Externalising the responsibility so to speak.\nThe general consensus seems to be that crime is like the sociologists might say “social in character” however it is not really due to “structural inequalities” as they are unlikely also to say. Today the people who commit crime are neither starving or disempowered; to some extent they are the same as too many others who are not involved in crime; welfare dependent, with a wide range of expectations like housing, consuming goods, free health care, and the right to have children at someone else’s expense. And therein lies the problem.\nThe fundamental relationship in society is that between parents and their children has been fractured by moral decline and the essential social responsibility for financing the children ones has, has been undermined by welfare. This scenario sets up the perfect conditions for a life of irresponsibility, and crime is an elemental part of these irresponsible lifestyles. In many if not all faith cultures, including the pre secular West, sexual behaviour is linked to maturity and taking on the responsibility for a wife and children.\nWhilst we may take slight exception to the suggestion that a man takes responsibility for a wife (this is the 21st century after all), the idea that two mature people have children in a fully considered relationship is sensible. They should also accept the constraints of a committed relationship and work together to provide the financial and social stability children need to grow up as stable responsible people.\nWith this kind of stable and loving background children are capable of growing beyond the social and financial level in society achieved by their parents. If this social and financial background is low waged but loving and secure; it should make no difference to social success. The main difference between the middle and upper classes and the rest of society is not education, it is responsible parenting. The prisons how have to extend parenting to people who have come to adulthood not as mature adults but as damaged and malfunctioning childlike men and women. No Governor can correct this long term undermining of an individuals social and economic opportunity, and if they could, it would cost a fortune.\nOur thanks go to Lord John Bird for inspiring some of this content.\n- 5.16 There are bloody revolutions, Red revolutions and Ideological revolutions and now we have a Blue Revolution. But why blue? V4\nSomeone asked one of us recently “why a Blue revolution”. The answer is easy and perhaps we should have shared it before. A Blue revolution is a Blue Collar…. Blue print…. to help save the people of the Blue planet from social and economic catastrophe. It is essentially a moral revolution and blue is the colour of morality too. No guns, no shouting, no politicians, no angst, or vested interest. Just a new perspective.\nWe are concerned with justice in the economic and social sense and see injustice in places that the prevailing orthodoxy sees only justification for the status quo. High salaries for the socially and economically unproductive public sector executive for example.\nSo whilst we see some element of “structuralism” in the problems the world faces, we at a Blue Revolution also recognise that we all have to become active moral agents again, as we were in the past, before technology and welfare freed us in the west from the ball ache of making actual moral choices.\nThanks to morals giving way to this Western ideology (secular westernism we call it) we have become objectified and objectifying consumers; fed a diet of banalities, and rubbish (both food and “stuff”) financed by debt of one sort or another and for too many, a “welfare” which has become devoid of promoting self respect or social responsibility. Fat people on welfare clogging up the British NHS with lifestyle diseases caused by choices only a morally bankrupt nation would encourage.\nWe don’t expect many takers for our revolution……at least not until the prevailing ideology has collapsed under the all too obvious weight of its flaws, fault lines and contradictions, and something else is sought that is not authoritarian or proto Islamic in character. Both are pretenders to the secular West’s throne.\nIn support of our position that the prevailing ideology is clinging on for dear life, we need do no more than to cite the UK governments attempts to get a Remain result in the EU referendum. To us their desperate approach illustrates just how close the EU is to its final death throws. The UK governments position is less of ringing endorsement of the EU and more a rather sad eulogy of its past achievements. Switch off the life support someone please!\n24.05.16 The proposal for a gold backed currency for Africa prompted the destruction of Libya. Hmmm but in a sort of James Bond world it kind of makes sense!\nNo we have no idea either!!\nHowever we doubt even the most idiotic African despot would trust his gold to the good old Libyan Colonel. Western tax havens and London property are much better investments and free of the worry that some North African rival might run off with them.\n31.05.16 The British Conservative Government seems obsessed with “social mobility”; given the privilege of the PM and Chancellor it is perhaps no surprise. However we at a Blue Revolution examine the great social engineering fiasco that is Post War British education. V4\nIt all began as most things have in the UK, just after the Second World war. A nearly broken Britain had, with the determination of every social class up to and including the monarchy, united in common cause, and with the friends of Empire had seen off the fascists or as we prefer to call them techno feudalists, of the Nazi regime.\nUnited in victory the 1945 Socialist Government won a resounding mandate and set about introducing a socialist programme of reform which saw the birth of the state pension, the National Health Service, Nationalisation of the “means of production” and the introduction of a progressive education system which saw the creation of the “tripartite” selection of children at age 11; the eleven plus. The war had shown that the public schools could not turn out enough men of the “right sort” to lead the front line war effort, so use was made of the men from the various British County Grammar schools. These men were in all three services and were often Sergeant Pilots when in the RAF. Whilst they were denied the Officers Mess, they had the technical know how and “non academic skills”to help take the air war to the enemy.\nAfter the war it seemed only fair and just that the old class divides were confined to history and the war effort made the need for this even more urgent. As a result of the introduction of the socialist programme, the Grammar schools delivered academic children into the Universities including Oxbridge. These more academic children began in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s to find their way, as you would expect, into the junior ranks of government and the establishment.\nThe second “arm” of the tripartite model were the technical schools; intended to take the students with an inclination for technical skills into educational pathways that may have led to engineering or chemistry degrees. Finally the rest were offered the “Secondary Modern”. A benign system for those who for various reasons “failed” the other two’s entry criteria.\nWhat quickly happened was the technical schools were viewed as a form of failure, as Britain, steeped in the traditions of the Public School had grown used to “success” and privilege coming via a diet of Latin and the Classics. The three school system became a two school system and this is where we and particularly some of our “old boys” think it gets interesting.\nThe Secondary Moderns achieved the objective of providing a range of post school opportunities which included the full range of jobs at the lower end of the economic scale; factory work, shop work, soldiers below officer rank, and clerks and managers in lower ranks etc. The routes into higher occupations were not closed to these people, but were perhaps achieved at a later date when their financial or academic interests had altered sufficiently.\nThe interesting stuff we believe happened in the Grammar schools however. As has been captured in numerous post war “classic” novels the Grammar schools delivered on their “progressive” agenda and had managed to get working class people into the ranks of Government and the Civil Service, the military, and the city. We could go on but in essence the “establishment” was opened up to people from the lower social ranks. Was this a good or bad thing? Well like all things it depends on your vantage point. If you were offering a top flight education in the Public School (Eton, Harrow, Westminster Greshams etc) it was bad news.\nAn academic child (then described as “bright”) could get to the top without the payment of high school fees and the top fee paying schools were feeling the pinch. The “old” establishment was concerned, and an unscripted conspiracy began to emerge to save them. Grammar schools made “failures” of children at the age of 11, or so it was claimed.\nThe essential point here is that Grammar schools were not being presented as a threat to fee paying schools but as somehow underscoring disadvantage to working and lower middle class children in a way that the fee paying schools had never been identified as having done; at least not overtly. The “old establishment” proposed with the usual connivance of the liberal left, the abolition of them and their replacement with “comprehensives”.\nThe slow re engineering of British class privilege was once again under way following the “Red Revolution” of the post war Labour Government which sought, but failed to stop it. Comprehensives gained additional traction during Britain’s numerous financial crises of the 1970’s; basically they were cheaper than a local authority running two separate schools.\nComprehensive education has gone on to dull social mobility by reverting to the mean. Academies are a good attempt to address decline but they will merely stall it; not reverse it. Averaging out the highs and lows of academic attainment and reverting to an often artificial “standard” simply reflects the average rather than the exceptional.\nWhilst in academic terms there may be some convergence between good comp or Academy and the fee paying sector, the simple truth is that the “non academic” standards are miles apart. Confidence, resilience, stability and emotional maturity are not academic subjects and so are not “taught”. However there is a greater chance of acquiring them in the fee paying sector with parents who have themselves the non academic skills to pas onto their children. Welfare and the decline of the family in “average Britain” has done nothing to promote and everything to undermine social mobility. It is not simply about exam grades.\nSince the 1970’s the social and economic decline in the UK has continued and the education system has, like social work and health, been expected to take over obligations once the normal expectations of good parents; whilst having to deliver academic “results”. In the New Labour years of Smoke and Mirrors, expectations in education were reduced to suggest progress was being made, grade inflation!\nNew Labour’s “investment” in people and “Education, Education Education” was a saddening failure for Britain and the now rejuvenated fee paying schools began to re colonise the silos of power like politics, the Military and the Civil Service and Law as well as making new incursions into well remunerated areas of the cultural environment such as Art and Acting.\nSo bringing things bang up to date, making young people declare their fee paying school “advantage” or “disadvantage” at interviews will not promote social mobility except at the cost of high standards…….sorry but it’s true…We wish it wasn’t but it is. The only way to improve the situation from here on is to repeal the law which prevents academic selection and allow it probably at 13 for some Academies. Alternatively some children to be afforded the privilege of a state supported private education.\nThe other plank of the proposed policy to not stop decline but to reverse it is to concentrate on reversing the sociological factors which undermine the “non academic skills” such as confidence and resilience. This requires a hard and brave look at the rights of parents who too easily have affairs and divorce whilst wrangling over “access” and Parental responsibility.\nThere will always be elites but as long as the elites have some sociological experience of being from a loving secure yet average background the maintenance of class privilege will eventually decline. This is the Blue Revolution …….the red one failed miserably let’s not forget.\nNB It has been pointed out by one wag that the policy to abandon selective education coincided with the Profumo affair. With Stephen Ward the establishment interloper and his bevvy of lower class women bringing too much of the junior NCO culture into the Officers Mess. The upper Classes had always frolicked but there were rules. The messaging was clear then, and in certain professions notably the upper echelons of the legal profession it is clear now, it’s not education that matters it’s class and that’s as much about the “non academic skills” as it is family background. In 1940 the Sergeant pilots and Officers may not have had family uniting them, but they had the same non academic skills. Not unreasonably for many the closer educational achievement and “non academic skills” are related the better. The workers had better start catching up rather than the Government embarking on another “re engineering” catastrophe to bring the privileged down. The Second World war showed it can be done, so lets do it.\n01.06.16 With an eye on social mobility The Government looks seriously at the right issue but does it understand the Cost of Kindness and the Price of Punishment; and more significantly, do we?\nThree hundred years ago and more no one went to prison as a punishment. Prison was where they were held before being punished by flogging or death. Those were brutal times. However the punishments were harsh because there was a need to maintain social order between the classes and the genders, not for no reason was killing ones husband described as petty treason. Punishment has always been about maintaining social order on behalf of the prevailing social and economic elite for example feudalism and male authority. It was all about retribution with a hefty dose of deterrence. It was public and brutal.\nBy the 1950’s in Britain prison itself became the punishment. Loss of liberty. It was also the period when punishment was identified as being about four things. retribution and deterrence were still there but now there was reform and rehabilitation. The psychologists had entered the market for government jobs and were advising that it was possible to retrain people to be “pro social”. An echo of “A Clockwork Orange”.\nThe need to punish was as we have said above to ensure the survival of the prevailing social order. Killing violent husbands could and would not be tolerated and therefore a warning had to go out to all women that to do such a thing would be dealt with publicly and humiliatingly. To not avenge in this way would undermine the elevated status of the male hegemonic structures and undermine social order which still saw control and ownership of resources as being the preserve of the male. As late as the 1930’s a woman would share the gallows with her lover if the lover had killed her husband, whether the woman was involved in the murder or not. The message had to go out !\nWhilst from the vantage point of the modern world it now seems unjust, back in the pre war era the punishment model was coherent and made sense. Retribution and deterrence as a role for prison was a vision shared at every social level\nIn the 1950’s the number of women in the prison system was low and the non criminal but “immoral” behaviours associated with reproductive control and marriage were also low, although growing in frequency. This eventually gave rise to the various divorce and abortion Acts of Parliament which whilst protecting individuals hid social problems rather than dealing with the causes of them. A legacy of which we have to confront today in family breakdown and then family reconfiguring plus single parenthood leading to social disadvantage. Its odd to think that in the Secular West millions of people mainly men are in families with someone elses children\nThe loosening of social bonds which has been going on since the 1950’s causes much anxiety with people demanding punitive action to re establish the social order which to many seems to be undermined as every year passes; yet prisons are full and we are told crime is down. Prison is clearly not achieving its now four stated aims of deterrence, retribution, reform and rehabilitation. We now pay for a punishment system that does little more that warehouse prisoners at massive cost to the taxpayer. Prison no longer deters, punishes, reforms or rehabilitates and all for £2000 per week, per prisoner. So what has gone wrong?\nFirstly we now have a society which is more equal than at any time in the past; and yet…..and yet, we still cling on to old views about past social arrangements and their iniquities. For example women can now, unlike any time before the 1960’s and 1970’s control their fertility. There is little if any shame in divorce and men and women are equal enough so that no longer is the woman dependent financially on the man and the man is no longer socially dependent on the woman for housekeeping, child rearing etc. Each has the capacity to control fertility, manage their lives sociologically and financially and be responsible and informed citizens, Contracting, Choosing and Consenting in their best interests and more significantly in the best interests of society at large. But too many are not doing so and are producing children in ill considered unions with too much fear and uncertainty. Children for whom as adults, life is a reckless game of chance with prison a structured place of safety; a reward rather than a punishment.\nThe welfare model based on “Victorian” social reforming Christian values, does not assume that women have personal control and responsibility, it is still inherent in the system that women are “victims” of male lust and stupidity and so welfare i.e. the tax payer, has to step in and in a “non judgemental” way support the woman who has babies outside of a planned and coherent family structure. The “rutting” male is also off the hook, having no financial responsibility for the offspring he has sired.\nThe whole welfare system is no longer “just” as it is no longer working in the interests of the whole community. Poor single workers are paying taxes to allow the immature, sexually reckless and self indulgent to have babies at the communities expense. There is no Contract, Choice and Consent in the arrangement any more (as there was in the days of marriage); simply a moments drunken passion or a “friend with benefits” arrangement lumbering the community with a baby probably no one really wants. Horrifyingly many end up aborted, but the numbers here also highlight how many must go to term as financial and too often social “wards” of the state. In the rush for sexual excitement the lack of informed choice between “adults” also gives rise to high levels of domestic violence.\nA Blue Revolution is about encouraging and defining a new “hegemony”; one that promotes class and gender equality and responsible choice about lifestyle etc. However the ease with which people give into impulse means that too many of us have not really developed mature adults mind-sets but are living like adults with childlike levels of personal responsibility and entitlement. The prisons are full of “child people”…… Prisoner is the wrong word.\nThe welfare systems role in “gaming” undesirable social outcomes is not in societies long term interests. It would be perfectly coherent to have a massive drop in the indigenous birth rate and then have immigration to top up the birth rate as long as underpinning the arrangement was some kind of coherent “family” unit and the expectation that children were supported lovingly by parents who were in work and not wholly the responsibility of the state and taxpayer. Contract Choice and Consent between people and the community within which they live, is the desired outcome of a Blue Revolution.\nSo what has all this got to do with the price of punishment and the cost of kindness. Well prison is expensive and achieves none of it past and more resent stated outcomes to deter punish etc. Welfare is kind and “non judgemental” but like prison achieves none of its stated outcomes, in the case of welfare to protect the vulnerable and prevent harm. Too many children come into the world as afterthoughts and too many are not afforded a loving home with loving people. There must be a moral revival, a Blue revolution that reflects the social and pharmacological changes that allow women and men to plan parenthood, and an acknowledgement that prison is simply a place to keep the anti social out of the way rather than somewhere that something useful takes place. Rehabilitation is a social function not a penal one!\nThe alternative is a society where prison and welfare create an expensive feedback loop that eventually undermines every bit of positive economic and sociological progress to date.\n06.06.16 The Economics of leaving the EU from the “economic illiterates” of a Blue Revolution……a final perspective…honestly….final! V5\nThe Economics of Remain and Leave are being partially explained but there is too much spin and misinformation on the part of both sides. We try and give a shamelessly un-impartial but we hope more considered perspective.\nFirstly the claim that the British economy will shrink if we leave the EU. The answer to this one is a clear, yes in the short term. If you reduce the number of migrants coming here a number of “inflating” factors will be reduced. Firstly “pressure on public services” will reduce, saving the taxpayer money on health, housing, criminal justice etc. The level of integration between the “government economy” (debt to you and me) and the “real economy” is so enmeshed that when the government spending drops, the economy shrinks. Building up the “real trading economy” will correct any shrinkage caused by the government reducing its immigration related spending.\nEven an armchair economist would see this reduction in spending by government as a good thing in the long term. Government spending is not the “real economy”. There is so much government spending we can’t even locate the “real economy” any more.\nSecondly a major proxy for the “real economy” is house price inflation. Building new houses for “middle class flight” to the “burbs” is apparently good for the economy….well according to Wizard Ozborne. House price inflation means that middle class, middle aged people can spend, spend, spend on consumer goods ….ignoring the needs of their children who are as a result priced out of the housing market. They keep up aggregate demand. House prices also allow builders to make profits that are taxed, and this is generally seen as good for “growth” or good for government spending. The poor old countryside too pays the price here providing green field sites for builders.\nWhat factors under pin house price inflation….well immigration for one thing (in the absence of “real economic growth”). Immigration also feeds the private sector rental market and drives up rents. The upward pressure on rents prices out British workers, but for the wizard Ozborne that is less important than the housing market creating disposable wealth for spending by the “comfortably off”. Cut back on immigration therefore and demand for housing reduces, reduce building and stop concreting over the country side and the economy will “appear” to shrink. Housing might be more affordable for blue collar and younger workers so it can’t be all bad news.\nThird issue, wages. We have a minimum wage. We need this. However it is not enough to buy a house or even rent one. It was introduced by “New Labour” precisely because it knew that with a policy of open boarders the reality of “downward pressure” on wages would have put British workers on the streets and on starvation wages. The tax credit system was an additional measure to protect the British low waged…however no one factored “free movement” into the equasion, a situation which has made the whole system unaffordable. But like house price inflation, the combination of taxpaying British and migrant workers, British workers on “out of work welfare” and British and migrants on “in work benefits” does feed the impression that the “real economy” is growing. Reduce welfare and the economy will “appear” to shrink. But that is like shrinking a debt by spending less; you look poorer but the reality is you are getting your house in order.\nIf we cut levels of migration it will stall the workforces race to the minimum wage and we may find wages rates growing…..cutting taxpayers support to low waged workers and lowering the “tax credit subsidy” big business gets from the taxpayer by government paying workers tax credits.\nFourthly the free movement issue. The remain people confuse…we are sure deliberately…the notion of “free movement of people” with “free movement of labour”. Under the current proposals free movement of people means anyone can come here from the EU with granny and the kids and no one can stop them. The unemployable, offenders, mentally ill can come along with those who are able to take a useful place in the labour market. We don’t really need more of the EU’s needy and vulnerable or dangerous. Taking away all welfare will return us easily to “free movement of labour”; we can’t imagine anyone will object to this, even the EU. All the British young who fear loss of opportunity to travel will still be able to travel to Europe to work. In a real Marxian sense not all people are “factors of production”; only workers require free movement in this free market closed bordered quasi socialist republic of the EU. Nobody needs the free movement of people\nFifthly the productivity of Britain is not going up, it is stagnant. The reason in economic terms is that cheap labour means there is no incentive for business to invest in technology to boost productivity. The minimum wage prolongs this process and low skill migration means we are unlikely to see productivity increase significantly over time. Minimum wage labour and migration stalls any increase in productivity and therefore undermines long term growth and prosperity.\nFinally a comment on Cameron’s claim we are leaving the single market if we leave the EU. This is totally spurious. We must not swallow the line by the Remain people who are claiming that Britain leaving will EU will result in the EU abandoning all interest in its original objective; peace through trade, including trade with the UK. The idea that we would be abusively cut out of the “free trade area” like an abused and rejected spouse is utter rubbish. We at a Blue revolution believe we may have to suck up some limited “free movement of workers” as described above, but the idea we will be frozen out of the “single market” is ridiculous.\nThe EU was and is about economics, trade and peace. Trading to build a common understanding and a common market. Unfortunately the EU sprouted a Commission, a Parliament and a Court; all in our view unnecessary. The EU needs Britain to become a beacon of world trade beyond Europe, to encourage global peace through global trade, particularly with English speaking African nations. The EU will not destroy the next British “Industrial and social Revolution”, but even with Brexit we will, we believe, have to compromise a little but at least with Brexit it will be a fair and open negotiation rather than an EU instruction.\nIt must be remembered that Britain has opted out of any further consolidation of the EU as a single political union. Free movement of people reflects the desire to achieve unitary political status. Free movement of workers reflects the desire to be part of a single market.\n08.06.16 We have been asked; if the expensive Criminal Justice System doesn’t deliver punishment, deterrence, reform or rehabilitation what do we think should be done? V2\nIn our previous post on this complex subject we suggested that the Criminal Justice System was no longer delivering any of the objectives it has been expected to deliver over the last thousand years. Yet it remains an expensive part of governments expenditure; expenditure which the government spends on behalf of the people. Western criminal justice and welfare are good examples of how secular westernism is undermining its crowning achievements of freedom, democracy, equality and human rights.\nThe tabloid press engage in moral outrage and indignation, demanding more and more prison for any number of crimes. Some of this is of course justified. Yet is there really any justice when the imprisonment for example provides a better life for young men than the amoral chaotic and emotionally turbulent and uncertain life outside the prison walls. We thought it was time we looked at this subject from the perspective of a Blue Revolution. Thank you to those who prompted us to do so because crime is a scourge on society and seems to us to affect most acutely the very people the government and society must protect, namely those who have less protection derived from their income, status and occupation and most importantly their location.\nIn our more philosophical post on the subject of prison and welfare we looked at the price of punishment and the cost of kindness and concluded that a combination of generous welfare and prisons that offered little in the way of reform were expensive and morally ambiguous. This gave rise to a confusing situation which had the capacity to generate a feedback loop of more people entering both systems and staying there alternating between the two. The victims of crime the very people who should expect the states protection, the vulnerable young and elderly from the very same poor and morally ambiguous communities.\nNow some, depending on ones “ideological perspective” might feel a sense of outrage at the term “morally ambiguous communities”. Isn’t this reinforcing prejudice against the poor? Well yes and no. As economic determinists we would argue that there is nothing particularly “moral” about a lot of what has “evolved” (devolved might be a better word!) in the last seventy years or so in the west. Dependence on welfare, a belief that children are a way of accessing welfare, fatherless children in stressed or psychologically damaged “families” with parents who’s coping mechanism isn’t to work hard together and provide to rise out of the ghetto but to “psychologically disassociate”. This leads too often to adults and young people seeking comfort in drugs, drink or promiscuous sexual activity this is morally ambiguous. The urge for society to be kind, conflicting with the urge to condemn. Moral ambiguity!\nIn general for too many men crime is the surrogate economy (just as welfare babies are in general a surrogate economy for too many women) and too many of these men become either neighbourhood “feudal Barons” or community “tribal warlords” with all that such systems inflict on those caught up in them. Extreme violence being only part of it. The broad aspiration to succeed only finding expression in how much you can trade in drugs, stolen goods, women, guns etc. Within our communities in the west this is too frequent a scenario. Prison for the leaders is a disruption, for the low ranks…the crime proletariat shall we say, prison is a break.\nSo from the economic determinists of A Blue Revolution some thoughts on how we might reform this expensive self defeating yet self promoting system. If you are wedded to a belief that the state is wholly responsible for the lot of the individual….you are a socialist…. you might wish to look away.\nFirstly no society that has ever thrived, spends more on those trying to undermine it’s values than t does on those upholding them. So we have a prison system that costs per prisoner more than the fees of Eaton to achieve nothing. That needs to stop.\nSecondly child birth is not and should not be “morally ambiguous”. No society that wants to survive can have people running around fathering children with women (girls too!) giving birth to welfare babies. Children should be societies investment in the future but too many end up being societies liability.\nNow in simple societies such children would be killed at birth or as adults killed for crimes social or moral. We do not advocate that. Such barbarism has no place in the 21st century. We also accept that there will always be cases of welfare children deliberately born to access benefits even if such behaviour was proscribed. Understanding of the motivation, be it anti social or borne of loneliness, rather than outright condemnation should be shown in such cases. However men and women have the power to control fertility so there needs to be a limit to societies empathy\nSo how then can we “re engineer” the “system” to stop these problems evolving in the first place and to make the system cost effective and morally coherent in the future.\nA recent case in the US of a male who received a six month sentence for sexual assault illustrates the point quite nicely for us. Here we have behaviour by this male which was simply disgusting. The world will know the details. He received a six month prison sentence because he was well connected and a successful athlete. Again moral ambiguity exists on both sides of the argument. The female has been viewed by some as contributory and therefore the male has had his culpability mitigated so his character and background serve to reduce perceptions of his risk. Understandably feminists and others want the judge who leniently sentenced him sacked .\nThere is talk of “cultural sexism” at work and it still being rife in the west. To the feminists we say “cultural sexism” is rife everywhere; from its most extreme in Saudi Arabia where being a woman is almost a crime to the US and Britain where sex is too often seen simply another “product” men can buy from women. Some men fail to read the signals properly or simply don’t care; they just consume a woman like they consume a can of beer.\nThis is a woeful reflection of the morally impoverished state of the modern human condition; reverting in too many instances to man re establishing his primitive dominion over women, either with cash or simply taking advantage of a woman’s vulnerability or availability. Pornography, promiscuity, adultery, illegitimacy are not things to be cruelly condemned with violence, this isn’t the seventh century, but they reflect in too many ways this primitive domination by men of women or in fewer cases in the modern west women’s cruelty towards men….sorry but we did suggest some of you may wish to look away. But what can be done to engineer a moral revival?\nFirstly prison and justice. The public want protection rather than retribution…only tabloids talk of retribution in the form of long prison sentences because they, like socialists, don’t recognise that it is the public who pay for it. You can’t be protected from people who have never offended so you have to use a conviction as a marker for potential future harm. A prison sentence should then be deployed that reflects the harm caused and the potential for harm in the event of the offence happened again. As the psychologists say “the best way of predicting future behaviour…is to look at past behaviour”.\nSo our American sexual abuser should not have been sentenced on who he was, but on what he did. Two to five years might have been more in line with his risk. However this is the bit that makes our view controversial….he may be able to persuade the professionals who manage is risk during his two to five years that he is safe to be in the community and so with some liaison with the victim and some safeguards being put in place he could be released after six months. Unlikely but in our view theoretically possible.\nSafeguards could include tracking, tagging, loss of licence to drive, passport or residence in a certain place, with parents say, plus supervision. This does not breach “human rights” as he would ordinarily be in prison. This brings the cost of punishment down whilst ensuring the victim and as importantly the public is protected. The cost of most of this shifts to the individual and the family of the offender and not as is wholly counter to social “evolution”; the public.\nOther advantages are that there could be expectations that the offender secures work or accommodation, undertakes treatment etc. if they fail to do so they are already on a prison sentence so they simply get put back in prison.\nNext welfare solutions. Welfare needs to be tapered so that you can only have one child at the governments expense, this is called structuring expectations. There should be no expectation that the government pays for any more. The grown ups amongst you will also realise that “the government” is simply a proxy for the people and the moral ambiguity we spoke of comes as a result of the government taking a different view of things from the people and trying to impose it on them, like expensive welfare and prison.\nPeople do not want to see children born to parents who can offer no long term economic or social support and who are destined to produce children who become the communities liabilities rather than social or economic assets in the form of good citizens or workers. We also need to ensure that we address the sexualising of society. Women (and some men) are not objects for consumption but it doesn’t help when society encourages them to see themselves precisely like that.\nThere are previous posts covering some of these complex issues. We could go on but this is a starter for ten.\n14.06.16 The “Publicsectocracy” one sizable obstacle to “the Blue Revolution”. A class at peace but only with itself! V1\n“Chumocracy” or Quango-ocracy the world is beginning to understand that there is a class of people in the west who have established themselves in positions of power and influence and no different from the feudal overlords of the past they have done this at the expense of the public. In many respects these people be they Health Chief Executives or Executive Head teachers, Judges, Generals or EU technocrats expect to receive salaries in excess of £100,000 per annum but in return they add very little discernible value to the society or community they serve. The reason being they are “figureheads” rather than operational staff such as actual health care professionals, soldiers, or teachers. We at a Blue Revolution want to explore the rise and rise of the “publicsectocracy” and why we need to review their existence, particularly as we move hopefully towards “Brexit”.\nThese “publicsectorcrats” are very expensive to maintain as a class of people. The numbers are significant and with on costs and pensions they take a sizeable sum of money out of the public purse. A purse that has to borrow at huge expense to the poor and young to pay for them. As economic determinists we understand the rise of the publicsectocracy. But also recognise that unlike capitalist who in the past appropriated “value” from workers ……having a right to some but not all of the value they appropriated; the publicsectorcrat has little if any legitimate right to the wealth they consume.\nThey like most modern sociological phenomenon the “Publicsectocracy” have their origin in an era long since past. In the feudal system the king identified himself has having a divine right to take whatever wealth he could acquire from those who created it. The aristocracy were there to ensure that the flow of wealth moved from the bottom to the top of society. The peasants toiled for little if any reward and were “bonded” or enslaved to their overlord. This is a system that was negated by the emergence of capitalism which was more overt in the way the process worked because there was no obvious legitimising ideology to support the appropriation of value by capitalists other than they owned and controlled the factors of production, which included “labour”. Karl Marx claimed that religion was the “Opium of the people” however it did not legitimise anyone being at the bottom of society in the way perhaps Catholicism and Feudalism worked together to make society rigid and un-dynamic and justify the status quo.\nWhilst the poor under capitalism could not enjoy “Contract, Choice and Consent” the concepts applied to them as much as to the rich. This is why the feudal system ended; it declined in power as society matured within the liberating framework of law based on Contract, Choice and Consent. Or as we at a Blue Revolution know them the three C’s\nWe have said this before but as society evolves we must hang on to this Capitalist legacy of Contract, Choice and Consent as it is the one element of the past that in a dialectical way must be preserved in the future. It protects vulnerable groups from abuse and this includes women, gays, differently gendered as well as faith groups and minorities. There is no substitute for the freedom afforded by the three C’s.\nHowever as society progressed through Capitalism getting richer and richer and spreading the wealth generating capacity of Capitalism around the world, its flaws and contradictions became more and more exposed; notably how the poor could not take advantage of the three C’s poverty precluded it.\nSo to overcome these contradictions governments stepped in to extend the practical ability of the poor to benefit from the fruits of Capitalisms freedoms. At its most extreme in Western Europe was Britain’s post war Labour government. To mount this “just” war on what became Capitalisms tendency to behave like a feudal system (calcifying wealth into the hands of a declining number of capitalists and excluding workers from the freedoms accorded to them by the three C’s) governments needed an army of bureaucrats who would manage the process of engineering social change.\nThese people “the public sector” were initially the recipients of payment drawn from the value produced by the capitalist system, but as now, soon came to see themselves as an essential part of a system that needed to be preserved whatever the cost. As western society became more and more dependent upon debt and Capitalism lost its value generating edge, so debt supported the publicsectocracy…by now like the feudal overlord and the uber capitalist who, rather than creating actual social and economic value simply turn personal and public debt into personal wealth; both are part of an intractable system that cries out for reform.\nBoth the secular western market system and the Publicsectocracy are wrongly seen as essential to the future well being of society and must be preserved at all costs. However both keep society enslaved just as surely but less “legitimately” than the economic eras that preceded them. We will leave it to you to work out why….but the incompetence of the EU goes some way to explaining our point.”\n20.06.16 British MP gunned down by a “crazy”. The solution; more respect in politics. Is this the real cause and the only solution?\nIn the eighteenth century one MP was told….”Sir you will either die on the end of a rope or die of the pox”. His reply; “That Sir depends upon whether I embrace your principles………..Or your mistress”. Politics has never been a nice business and was probably a lot nastier in the past than it is now. We at a Blue Revolution think something is wrong but we are not sure it is “politeness” or indeed respect.\nTo the economic determinists at a Blue Revolution the explanation might be a little more complicated and a little less easy for the “political and analytical” classes to accept.\nMore later…\n22.06.16 Final Plea to the British progressive “intellectual left”; vote Brexit tomorrow!\nWe have tried to explain the reasons why the EU is an unnecessary bureaucratic waste of a continents resources and we hope we have made our point. But if not some final comments. The EU is essentially a twentieth century solution (bureaucratic socialism) to a nineteenth/twentieth century problem (continental scale war and Capitalisms failure to re distribute wealth “fairly”).\nIt has however through trading only within its boarders effectively locked out the rest of the world from this peace through trade redistributive process and indeed has fostered war beyond its comfortable boarders whilst also fermenting tensions within them as it’s “mission creep” sought to create a superstate where one was not needed. Wanted is not the same as needed!\nBy allowing free movement of people as opposed to workers, its technocrats have allowed people unfamiliar with the democratic impulse (borne of work and enterprise) to wander free within its boarders and without the psychological conditions necessary to understand “freedom”; we call these conditions a belief in Contract Choice and Consent, these people now ghettoised on the continent threaten the very foundation of the free, democratic, life affirming system that protects all lifestyles we accept in the west.\nThe EU needs reform……it will never reform as it is not in its interests to do so. If you believe in people’s right to be free, self determining down to the level of the individual, you have a moral obligation to vote “Leave” on the 23rd.\nWe will explore this more after tomorrow when we will know the outcome of “independence day”.\n24.06.16 Well done to Britain; a more mature reationship with the EU beckons and bonus, we re enter the world.\nThere is nothing to fear from the result today. It is the best thing to happen to Europe since the the end of the Second World War. Europe needs to be liberated from the centralised control of the EU. The EU has become a post war model of bureaucratic socialism the intention to centrally “force” trade on an all too often warring Europe. The fact the “remainers” couldn’t sell the EU to the British public shows better than anything else its limited value.\nWar is no longer a risk within Europe due to trade peace and understanding. With Brexit the EU needs to recognise that the role of the old EEC achieved along with NATO a long term and now sustainable peace in Europe through trade. The EU was undoing that work going beyond trade and turning peace through trade into a Franco-German vanity project; the political bureaucratic and expansionist EU.\nThe British government will now consider the future and how to forge a mature relationship with hopefully a mature EU. This must retain free movement of labour within the EU and abandon the lunacy of free movement of people (no welfare for “workers” unless they become British). Secondly we will need to try to negotiate to retain a seat on the European Council and we should pay for the privilege. This is where we had some limited influence. Finally we leave the European Parliament and cease to be subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It sounds simple but essentially ignoring the technical details that is “job done”.\nWe need a relationship that reflects the old EEC ambitions this is what Britain instinctively wants. They instinctively don’t want to be paying for an EU public sector elite of high powered (and highly paid) Bureaucrats who line their own pockets whist undermining trade, profitability, and diversity with their silly Parliament and Court.\n25.06.16 In the wake of Brexit do Britain’s “Blair” generation need the psychiatrists couch? We consider the country’s youth and their collective mental health V3\nHere at a Blue Revolution we were not at all surprised that Brexit succeeded and indeed some of us considered the win only marginal rather than outstanding. It was the blue collar vote, invisible to the pollsters, that won it. People tired of seeing their wages pushed to the state minimum by waves of immigration.\nBrexit’s win foreshadows a new period of exciting opportunity for Britain as it re enters the global economy on its own terms having parked itself for too long in the malfunctioning EU. An EU of debt laden mature but declining states propping each other up whilst promoting policies which effectively undermine the ability of a nation state, any nation state, to prosper.\nHow did the EU get away with this and how close did we come to being locked into this failing arrangement. To make the EU legitimate the psychology of the individual nation state had to be “engineered” so that the aims of the EU have to become the aims of the individual within the nation state. Blair was the man who set out to promote this agenda, the discredited “diversity” agenda, with his personal narcissistic goal of becoming the EU president. In Britain like much of the EU the project was frighteningly successful.\nSo whilst the rest of Europe works out what it means for them now Britain has voted out; what do the young British Blair generation themselves make of the decision. They were clearly the foot soldiers of the Remain project. Firstly there must be some anxiety as young Britain has had to endure two kinds of psychological abuse. The abuse of the passive aggressive partner claiming as so many do “you are nothing without me”….”If it weren’t for me you would have no friends/money/ status on the world stage”, or “I’ll kill myself if you leave”.\nIf this wasn’t bad enough; and those who have been with a “Bunny Boiler” will recognise the scenario’s above; Britain also went in for some traditional self harm; Armageddon, World War three and “punishment budgets” and economic impending post Brexit crisis.\nAt the personal level this has left too many young people baffled, angry and confused. The young as always seem to be the most badly affected. This “Blair” generation of young entitled people have been raised in a moral kindergarten to expect “consumption” as the high point of their existence and “Brexit” has been presented as a threat to personal consumption. Not only that, it has been identified with restrictions on travel and opportunity to work abroad.\nThe reality of course is that there will be more not less travel as Britain re configures its international trade with an approach that opens up the whole world to opportunities to travel and not limit it to the mono cultural and racially homogenous EU. The Blair generation with their “iffy” GCSE’s in geography really don’t understand the difference between a continental land mass made up of nation states and a vain bureaucracy complete with bogus parliament and court of justice plus assorted “experts”. In confusing a passive aggressive bureaucracy with a continent of nations, young people fail to see the real limits to international travel and trade imposed by protectionism within the EU “family” with its enmeshed and unhealthy interdependence.\nThanks to a diet of pious “diversity” this inability to see the reality of what is going on is a kind of cognitive dissonance and causes the young to misunderstand the world around them and misread their role within that world. They get petulant and start to shout ill informed slogans like “don’t take me out of Europe” “Not in my name” or they view the bureaucratic socialism of the EU as “progressive”. Other manifestations are the habit of “no platforming” speakers with generally traditional appetites for debate whilst happily segregating themselves along gender lines whilst listening in awe to a load of twenty first century theological hogwash dished up as “cultural diversity”.\nWe at a Blue Revolution take the view that this referendum had to happen when it did and no later than 2018, so full thanks should go to Dave Cameron for his courage in holding it. If it hadn’t happened when it did by 2018 the people who by dint of their age predate the “Blairification” of the masses would be insufficient in number to swing the referendum to Brexit.\nThe young now have an opportunity thanks to Brexit to get excited about trade deals with the countries of six habitable continents as oppose to just one and to look forward to seeing the whole world as it really is in all its awesome wonder, full of potential trade and travel opportunity and yes dangerousness. By overcoming the dissonance caused by the “Blairification” of public education, they will be able to avoid seeing the world from the perspective of a risk averse, manipulative and self regarding European elite, who to a majority of the British voter have been shown up to be “Kings with no clothes”. Sorry guys but the project is over, your game is up…..at least in the UK.\n28.06.16 Blinking into a new dawn; have the Brexiteer’s lost their direction? V2\nThe sky hasn’t fallen in and hopefully now that we have sent a seismic shockwave through the EU world war three might be staved off for a century or so. The stock market has done what it will always do when confronted with a bit of “uncertainty” to undermine “confidence” it has swung around a bit as of course has the pound. However the reality is much of this was within normal parameters and whilst the seismic shock may have upset the EU grandees it has done little to derail the markets; which tells us all a lot. However what does Brexit actually mean and how can the UK help the EU smooth its exit.\nFirstly there is a need for a theoretical model to offer some strategic guidance and shape the form of the debate. We at a Blue Revolution offer some suggestions based on a our sound theoretical model of Economic Determinism informed by a free market consumerist economy, which we want to see change.\nWithout a doubt trade must continue; this is the EU’s reason to be it is what the EU has contributed to bringing peace in Europe (along with NATO as the military wing of the EU). The main concession is around workers movement, which will be barely understood by the workers of Britain. British workers however need to understand that free movement of workers is not the same as free movement of people.\nWith free movement of people you don’t actually need a job to come to the UK. But if you come to the UK you can bring the kids and the partner, you can even bring mum and dad to look after the kids whilst the worker is at work. All of this is subsidised by the “in work” benefit system. Unemployment with kids is also problematic and gives access to “out of work” benefits. So workers should not be incentivised to bring them unless their wages are high enough to pay for them.\nTherefore workers as a factor of production can and should be able to travel freely, people (including the ill and lame), kids and the elderly who are not factors of production, can’t. Really that old EEC principle needs to be enshrined in EU law as France or Poland might start to question this “principle”. It is lunacy to promote free movement of people.\nSecondly some of the institutions of the EU have some merit….but some not much. The Council of Europe is a must. We cannot walk away from this institution and must pay to stay. It will put us at the table for important discussions about security, crime, economics, trade. The Council of Europe is an important institution and like the Commonwealth brings consenting nation’s together.\nSecondly, and this makes some of our “revolutionaries” feel a little queasy, the EU Commission probably needs some UK funding and some “Commissioners” or representatives from the UK. EU trade and industrial standards are needed by the UK to compete with the EU and its member states. This will need paying for. It would be wrong to avoid influence here.\nHowever the EU Parliament and its army of millionaire MEP’s should not be something the UK pays for; We believe it is an institution which adds little value to Europe and along with the Parliament can go those Commissioners who the UK feels are irrelevant to its long term economic prospects. No longer subject to EU law the European Court of Justice is unnecessary for Britain too.\nWith free movement of workers and no welfare accelerating the free movement of people and with no silly EU elections to the European “Parliament” the obvious manifestations and irritations of the EU will have gone. There may be a price to pay to get the best deal; it may be we have to pay 15% of the EU budget for a few years, until we get VFM and pay for what we get and they sort out their efficiencies. However we will need to accept that we can’t stop paying straight away……but in 10 years time it will all be “history”.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-loathing-by-the-white-elite-for-white-middle-aged-men-we-comment/content_371.html": "The loathing by the white elite for white middle-aged men. We comment.\nWhy is it difficult to identify the cause of the distaste for the white middle-aged, middle-class male by the white non-grafting elite. Some have speculated that the elite are ingratiating themselves with the theologians of PC or virtue signalling the new culturally approved piety of cultural Marxism. Some of these arguments are persuasive and for one commentator Toby Young writing in the Spectator hopes to work out his preferred opinion before he has to part with more television licence fee money as the BBC elite are advocates of getting white middle-aged males off the box.\nFor Blue Revolution, it is a very straightforward issue, but hard to explain. So here goes. The elite has a hair trigger for ‘class’ being oversensitive about what they see as their own privileged position culturally politically and in the arts. However, they seem unwilling to grasp the fact that class, as anything meaningful in a Marxist sense no longer has relevance and, rather embarrassingly, it has been replaced by a global resurgence of the ancient concept of ‘status’. Obsessing about class and ignoring status allows them to overlook the new post-capitalist structures that have created their own privileged position in life.\nIn classical Marxist terms, the ‘class of a person is created by the relationship between that person and the means of production and in particular, their role in creating wealth. The modern elites are not therefore defined by ‘class’ but as such but by their status. This is because they have gained and hold power and influence not by exploiting workers in a Marxian sense, but by operating within a closed system that has power and influence paid for by taxation or debt which is taken at source from workers wages, or in the case of the BBC the licence fee.\nThis creates an embarrassing problem for the ‘right on’ elite. They recognise their own superiority compared to what they incorrectly see as the ‘working class’. However, its difficult to accept their lofty position may be part of the problem based on their own ‘privilege’ because as pseudo-Marxists they adopt the view that they are there to promote as ‘class outsiders’ the interests of the working class and all its minority offshoots be they black, transgender or Gay. This is ‘Blairism’ or ‘Clintonism’. This explains why they still think there is a Capitalist class that needs bashing and don’t see there a privileged class of elites of which they are part.\nFor the pseudo-Marxist elite, therefore, the only way of maintaining this idea of working-class ‘good’ ‘middle class’ bad, is to turn their back on to those they see as less important members their class group. This is the use of status and status has never been class-based, it is an ancient privilege that is conferred by acquired or inherited power, and is definitely not linked to one’s role in the grubby world of the productive economy.\nThis privilege passes within families (Kinnock’s/Blairs/Freud’s etc) and allows a person to publicly denounce their own ‘class’ members with a degree of relaxed superiority based on their status. To preserve their status and feel good about their values this high-status elite are able to denounce or sack those of similar ‘class’. All with the connivance of the status-dependent 21st-century’ state’ or the Board of the BBC and then to dress up their values as a war on ‘class’ privilege, as opposed to status. This pretty much explains the battle lines in Brexit. The High-status elite against the lower and middle-status workers.\nThey get away with it because they understand how the intellectually deficient ‘left’ respond approvingly to ‘dog whistle’ terms like a class privilege and class disadvantage.\nThe modern world is turning back towards status as in the West ‘class’ as a meaningful way of defining people declines in relevance. Most of the non-capitalist world still reflects ‘status’ which is an ancient form of describing power and importance. In much of the wider world as well as in the West there is no such thing as a modern exploiting middle class so there is no exploited ‘working class’. Even so class privilege rather than status continues to be the elites ‘straw man’ tackled by virtuous pseudo-Marxists whilst they cunningly ignore their own illegitimate status and the illegitimate power that goes with it.",

However, they are largely responsible for turning the second and third generation of unemployed industrial and agricultural workers into the so-called underclass…a group who lack both a voice and a reputation for militant class rebellion.\nThis happened because hapless Blair, Brown and Balls “globalised” the British economy exporting jobs to China where there were no trade deals but cheap labour and importing workers from the EU where they would benefit from the Brown welfare reforms of tax credits and “in work benefits” due to EU regulations. The resulting effects were to stimulate the Brexit debate as it became clear that the ex-industrial workers were not finding jobs of equal quality but were being largely overlooked by an economy that could find no useful role for them. The minimum wage didn’t really help. This was intended to “protect” the British workers from the downward pressure on wages that would result from opening up the labour market. It quickly became a maximum wage and with other costs associated with being in work, it deterred British workers from coming off welfare and getting a job.\nAny intelligent government would have realised that this worker dislocation should drive policy decisions to correct the effects of globalisation but for Blair, Brown and Co as long as the free market generated tax revenue and these ex-workers could be paid welfare the system was tolerable. The free market was, however, trading in toxicity as became apparent in 2007/08.\nThe situation has changed little. The ex-industrial and agricultural workers continue to clutter up various public sector waiting rooms and the NHS, producing children with multiple disadvantages, whilst the exporters of their jobs enjoy super-profits that if not tax avoided generates nothing like the tax they should. So who are the revolutionary class now? Well everyone who pays for a Parliamentary system that has failed to reflect the expectations of the people and now simply reflects it’s own need to govern.\nThe British state and it’s institutions (Parliament, the Law, the military and local government) is bureaucratic slow-witted and out of touch. We have an eighteenth century legal and military system, a nineteenth century parliamentary and penal system and a twentieth-century education and welfare system. In view of this, it is time ordinary taxpayers embarked on a revolution to change for good what the British state does and how it does it and to drive down how much it costs so we can drive down taxation. The industrial workers don’t exist because mass employment in “industry” no longer exists, we have to reflect this in our next revolution by appealing to the new “working class”.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_will-labour-undermine-the-principle-consent-with-their-socialist-obsessions/content_206.html": "Will Labour undermine the principle of consent with their ‘socialist’ obsessions?\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels were clear; however “unfair” Capitalism was, it liberated people from any servitude based on inherited status or gender (as opposed to class) and had the transformative capacity to deliver justice based on the proletarianisation of all workers whether male or female. Their view was that capitalism’s principles (we call them Contract, Choice and Consent) should become enshrined in the brief socialist phase of history, before being seared into a post-socialist society by the “dictatorship of the proletariat”. Liberation from exploitation, of whatever sort (status, gender or class) was Marx’s “riddle of history solved”.\nSocialism is, therefore, a phase on the road to the full liberation of workers, not the end stop of that process. To work as it should, socialism needs a profitable capitalist system upon which to feed prior to the “dictatorship of the proletariat” emerging from the socialist state itself.\nThere are problems with this essentially 19th-century vision today, however, not least of which is the absence of real profitability generated by the exploitation of the worker within a powerful western capitalist economic system. A capitalist system that can be placed initially under the control of the state and then the working classes.\nToday it is the western blue-collar workers who finance the Nation State its politicians, banks and well-paid hangers-on. It is equally true that working class people are also more than likely to be of this unlovely collection, cast out into a kind of economic oblivion brought about by global forces, in particular, relatively high wage levels and low western economic productivity.\nThe free market racketeer who is often passed off as a ‘capitalist’ offshores profits and gets the Chinese government to exploit its workers on their behalf by producing ‘consumables’ in planet-destroying quantities. Globally this is a racket, not a system. It bears little resemblance to Capitalism, it is gamed by powerful forces including candidates like corporations and global investment, as well as unlikely characters like the BBC and political parties.\nIs there any good news in all this?\nWell yes, there is excellent news. Firstly with capitalism lasting as long as it did, socialism and social liberalism was able to give “social character” to values based on the capitalist principles of Contract Choice and Consent. We now have solid humane and liberal values within a framework of law which protects groups that in primitive (pre-capitalist) societies are hounded, bullied, persecuted or killed. This includes apostates, dissenters, gay people and women seeking liberation from the tyranny inflicted on their gender by state, tribe or caste. Capitalism has left a legacy of justice even though it was unarguably a very unfair system. To fail to understand this distinction between justice and fairness leaves the “socialist” open to the kind of idiocy one observes within the “Marxist” Labour Party today.\nEssentially the current iteration of Labour has a misguided view of capitalism’s legacy fetishised into ‘Tory’ hating. They fail to grasp that Western Capitalism is already dead replaced by global racketeering and that their parochial economic plans will be an insufferable burden on the working class for hundreds of years. They fail to understand the origins of liberal values within the capitalist system and so oblivious to real liberalism, hobnob with a collection of groups who like them might hate capitalism, but also hate its liberation of women and others too. They fail to grasp that control, exclusion and coercion are pre-capitalist principles and that by flirting with people who adopt them (and by adopting them themselves) they place the liberty of us all in jeopardy.\nOur economic situation is precarious enough with the racketeering of the global elites undermining our Nation States all over the western world, but with Labour, not only do we as workers have that to contend with but the probability under a Labour Government of a slow and remorseless rolling back of our freedoms to Contract, Choose and Consent to take us back to an age of overt State control. Marx and Engles were wary of the State. As with their mangling of the “many and the few” once again it’s clear to us Labour’s ideas are not what Marx or Engels would have had in mind when crafting their beliefs. Consent is not safe with Labour and we should all worry.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_is-the-states-love-in-with-the-financial-sector-the-nations-biggest-threat-we-consider-the-question/content_177.html": "Is the State’s love-in with the financial sector the Nation’s biggest threat? We consider the question.\nBoth main parties have big flaws in their understanding of the landscape of modern economics. This impedes their ability to formulate policies which will empower the working class and lift our nation out of its current diminished, debt dependent and low productive state.\nWe have done some work on exposing Labour’s 19th and 20th-century parochial simplicities in the face of massive global forces. Now a short but productive journey in Lincolnshire gives us a chance to explore the 21st-century failings of the State and its lazy wizard of Oz-like economics.\nSomewhere between Louth and Lincoln in the UK, there is a field on the outskirts of a small town. A large Estate Agents board proclaims “development opportunity/shops/hotel/restaurant”. Nothing too sinister about this of course except that developments like the one proposed here are what has replaced a “real” economy of production, extraction and manufacture which used to support the financial and other sectors. The “productive” energy of the modern economy is the financial sector. The Tories claim that penalising the financial sector will reduce the number of “good jobs”. That may be true.\nHowever if “good jobs” depend on financial engineering as opposed to real engineering then this might be a sacrifice worth making in the short to medium term. These are the kinds of discussions governments should be having with their people as whatever happens real people will be more affected than governments.\nThe economic model upon which our current ‘growth’ is based is a throwback to Blair and Brown in the UK and in the US the Clinton and “W” Bush years.\nThis economic model has been described as “post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory”. Essentially the government spends money to stimulate economic growth, investing in education, the public sector and infrastructure projects. To fund this programme governments borrow. To give its early political advocates credit they did believe it would stimulate economic growth. What they failed to grasp was the link between ‘growth’ and personal and government debt, and the global context within which all this borrowing was going on!\nFor desperate politicians who had collapsing ‘real’ economies, post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory offered the tonic the nation needed. The “cool Britannia” hubris was a reflection of nieve certainty this was the end of “boom and bust”.\nAmerica was ahead of the game on the same diet of debt based stimulation. Clinton and his economists also allowed such a poor framework of regulation, adopted in the UK that banks were printing millions of dollars to lend to subprime borrowers who were like an x-factor wannabe convinced they were millionaires in the making. All it needed was a lot of borrowed cash plus that blend of skills that can only be honed eating in fast food outlets and dreaming in front of the mirror and everyone could be a winner! The bankers got the commission, as the whole system shuffled towards collapse.\nWe all know the fallout both sides of the Atlantic. The banking crisis of 207/8 and bank bailouts to keep the economy alive and supplied with debt or rather liquidity and demand. How did we all end up here?\nIn simplistic terms, the financial sector in the 1980’s went from being a petit-bourgeois servant of the economy to its very effective master and by the 2000’s was effectively in control of the global economy. The success of financial sector engineering has prevented the collapse of the economies of the Western world due to its ability to mix asset value inflation, debt and confidence in an ever-expanding and planet consuming vortex of consumption and waste.\nThis is the world we live in today, cars, jobs, houses, holidays, gadgets and consumables. This model forged on the 1980’s hasn’t changed at all. Governments borrow and it flows into the domestic and the global markets, students borrow and after a brief sojourn in the UK it flows into the global markets. People borrow and it flows into global markets. The bigger the government the more it can borrow hence the markets love of the EU and the market’s seduction of the “Remainers”. The EU is a big beast of borrowing.\nSo what has this to do with a field in Lincolnshire, this borrowing and spending, “Alice in Wonderland” economic model?\nWell, our farmland will give up producing food value and be sold creating wealth as the farmer makes money from the land as opposed to off the land. This he or she will bank helping bank profitability. They will also spend it, perhaps abroad, maintaining a bit of the aggregate demand the system needs whilst also fuelling the global markets.\nBefore the farmers gain in banked, a bank will lend money to a borrower so they can buy and develop the land. This will allow a business to be constructed in bricks and mortar employing local tradespeople and service sector workers. The business will achieve profitability allowing debt to be serviced and taxation paid. Its existence in a small town may possibly force the closure of other similar businesses putting those properties back on the open market, so the financial sector can turn the crank again, releasing more equity perhaps. Debt from elsewhere in the economy (government borrowing transformed into public sector wages for example) will provide the demand for this business and its profits will be taxed to benefit the government.\nWhat has gone on here? Well just like in the 2000’s nothing very much. Some confidence based financial jiggery-pokery has allowed some land to be equity released, making a farmer very rich. Debt is used to build and run a business employing people and debt makes it profitable. Oh and according to the Conservatives this process creates “high-quality jobs” which is probably correct in the financial and construction sectors. This whole process is going on all over Europe, America and the West in general and it has nothing to do with creating real economic value. We know it is a caricature, but we believe it is broadly right.\nThe question for us all is; where does this “economy” finally end and what will the world look like when it does end up somewhere? A planet exhausted by pollution and ecological abuse. A western population who have come to rely on ecological destruction to maintain a lifestyle of debt and alienation. Cultures of faith or ideological simplicity may be ready to step in and force the return of humankind to a sustainable but gender binary harsh and essentially by modern standards abusive existence.

With them in place revolutions will never look like previous revolutions in Russia or China where the state totally dominated the people. These revolutions were carried out in Karl Marx’s name but are not Marxist revolutions.\nWhilst to contract, choose or consent using these principles should never be impeded by the state or prevented by public prejudice in respect of dealings between competent adults it should not be the duty of the state to promote or finance any group wanting to exercise their rights under these principles.\nIf the state goes over and above protecting a right and moves towards paying for a right to be exercised, then beyond a certain point the state loses public consent. This is the situation the bourgeois socialist elite have placed the public in, in matters relating to religion, sexuality and sexual identity.\nOf course, we should respect someone’s right to identify as they wish, as Muslim, Christian, man or woman, Gay or straight but it is a matter for them as to how they exercise these rights in their dealings with others, balanced as it would need to be on the basis of reciprocated rights to contract, choose and consent.\nThe principles above should apply to having children too. Having children has become as a result of dramatic sociological and economic changes a subsidised lifestyle choice over which the taxpaying public at large have little choice but to pay. Parents knowing full well, they cannot afford children, go ahead and have them anyway.\nThe elite – clueless for a solution to a growing moral and financial crisis caused by the economic changes referred to in a previous section of this pamphlet, continue to throw taxpayers’ money at the problem. The resulting mental health crisis, domestic and child abuse and crime are for the state problems to be mitigated using large state bodies employing millions of workers. These bodies are managed and led by a very well-paid bourgeois socialist elite.\nWe at A Blue Revolution consider that in the absence of political legitimacy and subsidised by a clueless bourgeois state, western morality has become infused with a thoughtless “do as you like” attitude which has reduced too many adults to behaving irresponsibly. Too many adults are docile, apolitical and happily fed a diet of welfare top ups, healthcare and identity politics. One spin off from this process is that too many people no longer make grown up informed choices about things like having children or getting a job.\nThe modern state, managed by our bourgeois socialist elite, has given up any pretence of genuinely promoting rights and responsibilities beyond that of identity and consumer rights and responsibilities. The reason is that modern elites do not understand where economic and social value comes from and believe that what you are paid is what you are worth as this reflects what you can spend. They misunderstand that value is more than wages. Yes, value is the profit created by waged workers, but it is also the valuable work done by people trying to make society function efficiently and safely.\nTo try and re-establish social cohesion by encouraging personal responsibility and taking the very sensitive issue of having children as an example our suggestion is as follows.\nIn the twenty first century working people are intelligent enough to negotiate a proper contract for the care of their children. This contract should always precede the birth of a child. The contracting people on whatever basis, must agree to share the responsibility of the child they are having. A child with no planning or contracting would see the state take over care and no financial advantage applies to either parent. It will of course be possible for a state informed by popular opinion and based on contract, choice and consent to contract with parents in relation to education for example. We have for too long confused rights to have a child with the elite’s view that irresponsible behaviour cannot be criticised and must be a legitimate lifestyle choice.\nSo, we must work towards making contract, choice and consent the foundation of the British way of life and a political constitution. Nothing is given or received unless it is contracted for, freely chosen and consented to. Even welfare!\nSUMMARY\nContract is based on choice and consent so this should be the basis for all relationships ensuring that everyone is free to live their lives as they wish within a legal and political framework underpinned by the common consent of the people. Irresponsible behaviour would not be encouraged. This is what Karl Marx meant by the dictatorship of the proletariat. Not a bourgeois socialist paradise for the political elite but an economically and socially more equal world where the moral framework is underpinned by liberal principles of contract, choice and consent which in turn gives expression to pro social collective behaviour.\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_whats-wrong-with-westworld-maybe-quite-a-lot-but-its-not-down-to-the-workers/content_186.html": "What’s wrong with ‘Westworld’?- Maybe quite a lot but it’s not down to the workers!\nWestworld is the name we have given to the nations of the Western world. The UK, Canada, and the US plus of course the European Union. Westworld has subsidiaries in South America and the Middle East.\nIt doesn’t seem a day goes by without more and more evidence of a crisis in Westworld. We know the symptoms: mass immigration, failure to integrate by large groups of people from places like North Africa, economic stagnation remedied by debt and an apparent disdain by our ‘Elite’ for the values of the Enlightenment, reflected in the apparent promotion of values hostile to ordinary worker’s freedom of speech. Enlightenment values of freedom and rationality underpin the principles of capitalism: namely contract, choice and consent and with them came our precious, albeit limited democracy.\nSo, what has gone wrong? Is it class warfare? is it a conspiracy by the Elite to control working people? Is it global backhanders from Saudi princes? is it naive top-down Cultural Marxism gone mad? Is it an exhausted liberalism and welfarism that has simply given up in the face of a moral onslaught from some individuals from the Islamic world and particularly North Africa and the Middle East? Is it the birth of a new global economic model?\nOr is it a bit of all of them?\nWelfare hasn’t really helped the West, but it may be unavoidable in a world of declining economic strength. There is no doubt that the social reform agenda that has been delivered since the end of World War two it has been a mixed blessing. Policies, like liberating the gay community a social and economic good, reducing hatred and fear within our communities and bringing the gay community foursquare into huge areas of economic productivity, has proven popular and progressive. Abortion became a necessary evil, it prevented misery for women and along with the contraceptive pill liberated them from a life with limited choices. Limited choices for women are once again being promoted by some within some incumbent faith communities using religious text as a justification.\nLiberalising the Divorce Laws was again necessary, preventing a lot of misery for adults whilst an unintended consequence has been passing misery and depression onto many children. The economic aim was perhaps to maintain parents in the workplace and increase overall consumption (two TV’s as opposed to one!), whilst unintentionally rendering too many young people damaged by early adulthood and therefore economically inactive; the consequence of a “messy” divorce. It isn’t divorce, that is the problem, of course, it is the ease by which adults feel able to have children who then get embroiled in the emotional horror of the divorce itself. That is perhaps down to welfare again. It may also link to the economic uncertainties being created by the exhausted capitalist system as it rolls back to the West displacing whole nations from the value-creating juggernaut of capitalism or simply leaving people behind at home.\nThese are three big-ticket ‘social’ reforms of the post-war era. However, the impact has been different in respect of each. The latter two have left an unintended and expensive legacy both socially and economically. But we are where we are here in Westworld and no one would want to reverse the social progress achieved so far.\nWith capitalism only thriving in the Far East and China both active on the economic world stage, Westworld has been left with a legacy of unachievable moral and social expectations, declining economies and debt. With a white-faced Anglo-Saxon elite realising that the world that made them rich or powerful or both is in a state of permanent decline, they are forced to look around for a fashionable theory or policy to revitalise that which made them who they are. Now it all seems to have failed they consolidate their privileged position and then give up trying to advance ours, in fact, they make matters worse for working people by trying to place the guilt for the consequences of their failure on us in the form of ‘white privilege’.\nThe Elites incompetence has come close to killing the economic goose that once laid capitalism’s golden egg. But the goose isn’t dead because the Westworld working people are becoming an economically literate and motivated radical force driven by anger and constrained only by the old-world order of financial and social privilege. This hegemonic system will have to be burst asunder before the workers of the West can be liberated from the oppressive control of our Elites.\nIf our Elite continues to oversee the world’s economic affairs the Western economies are doomed. Hiding behind the protectionism of Trump’s ‘America first’, or the EU Customs Union the Western world is heading towards economic stagnation. As a result, our culture is at risk of being overwhelmed in places by the ancient simplicities of Nationalism or resurgent Islam offering solutions to Westworld’s social problems and emboldened in their determination to change our way of life by the power of engineered mass migration.\nThe Islamic world may believe it has some solutions to the Westworld moral crisis, but this simply isn’t the case. Islam has a poor track record of furthering economic and social evolution. Following a period of renaissance when Islam ‘secularised’ in the 12th century, when it became feudal, the various iterations of the faith since then would impede the evolution of the Middle East from then on with only a brief ‘enlightenment’ from the 19th to mid-20th century as capitalism held sway and again secular reform was intended to bring prosperity across the Muslim world. As crony capitalism has failed across the West and the Middle East some Islamic nations have re-adopted Sharia as opposed to secular constitutions. What else should be the response to economic stagnation in the 20th and 21st century Middle East one might ask. Well, a rebooted capitalism with the demand that its values are progressed to all people.\nOil money in the twenty-first century is offering some ‘progressive’ development of a very limited and questionable sort in Saudi Arabia a country promoting fundamentalist Islam around the world, but a country that without oil wouldn’t exist as a viable nation-state. So, with capitalism collapsing in the weaker Islamic nations and Islam as a faith resurgent and confident, the Westworld worker has street corner theologians shouting down our values as our utterly lost Elite turn a blind eye. Westworld has its own dodgy theologians of course.\nWhen one listens to the theologians of Westworld, in the US the Clintons and Obama, in UK Blair and Nick Clegg, in the EU every technocrat with a microphone and in Canada Justin Trudeau one can see people who simply can’t grasp the concept that the system that made them rich is finished. Whilst the system may have finished for them however, it has plenty of life in it, if it is given to the people at large. The Elite seem unwilling to do that and we are therefore at risk of having our culture compromised by advancing ideologies of Nationalism or from some quarters a demand for the promotion of radical or even just observant Islam. Both would limit the rights of working people. Therefore in creating the demand for repressive change, our Elite is now a threat to us, Westworld’s working people like never before. So, what are the causes of the Elite’s and our collective crisis?\nAt the top of the political sphere, the Elite promote the old-fashioned idea that debt unconnected with investment can be a stimulus to growth. They have also embarked upon regeneration wars to bomb democracy into the Middle East and North Africa, whilst hoping to reconstruct these places using Western firms and Middle Eastern oil money. The consequence was as we know complete failure. Additionally, in rubble-strewn failed states Islamism becomes coherent as a way of ordering an otherwise chaotic society, so the world got ISIS. ISIS of course inspired by the hard-line Sunni Muslims of Saudi Arabia promote the example of seventh century Mohammad as a major influence on their way of life, a life of shameless brutality.\nOn the home front and for working people welfare has unavoidably become the Elite’s replacement for real social and economic value creating employment. Within the context of declining economies and a new reliance on debt, there is the illusion of a vibrant free market economy which whilst failing to keep the West on top economically has continued to reassure the Elite that life for them is business as usual. They have allowed a mechanism to be engineered by the banking system and global markets that turn our debt (national and personal) into wealth for them and their cronies. Of course, it brought us to our knees in 2007/08 and today we are back on the same horse.\nIf we pick up from 2007/8 the Elite have managed to save themselves and convince themselves, they have saved us but only by working the biggest confidence trick in modern history. They have turned the Westworld workers into a new class of twenty-first-century Serfs. We now pay taxes, service National and personal debt and spend what money we must ensure the Westworld economy looks like it is functioning when, like putting compressed air through a steam engine rather than steam, it just looks like it is working. This is a ‘Wizard of Oz’ illusion. The Emerald City of the Clintons, Blairs, EU and others involves workers giving away our good jobs, our productive capacity, plus amassing debt on an eye-watering scale to keep the elite in their positions of power and influence. They can use the banks and the Wests 18th century political systems and associated institutions to maintain their illusion and of course, they do.\nTheir wars of ‘reconstruction’ have burdened the working people with an additional problem. Migration. Not Migration from places with a cultural heritage of the Enlightenment and Contract, Choice and Consent but migration from places with a pre-capitalist feudal-like and simple worldview based on control, coercion and compulsion and for many this is linked to belief in the infallibility of the Quran and Hadith. The wars of reconstruction have failed, but the elite has it that migration has always been good at stimulating growth. Well yes and no. It depends on who is coming in. The Jewish community that came before and during World War two undoubtedly contributed a great deal to post War Britain’s economic reconstruction.\nThe Windrush generation added much socially and culturally but was probably less significant in economic terms and the most recent arrivals sadly seem to have added very little. Many have either taken low skilled work or some having pre-capitalist values of submission, have introduced a form of multi valueism in the West offering to compete with Western values. This has wrong-footed the Elite as previously their multiculturalism was set within a thriving capitalist framework and was the West’s expectation, not value systems competing within the Nation States themselves.\nThe lack of thriving capitalism is what has exposed the difference in values and made them so stark causing fear within all communities; established and newly arrived. The big debate is whether this has been a deliberate policy by the global elite to alter Western society. Our view is probably not. It’s just the consequence of everything we have described above and the Elite not knowing what to do about it.\nOne specific challenge to Western values comes in the requirement of Islam as a faith for men and women to be treated with differential standards and expectations. Something Karl Marx and Frederick Engels disapproved of, calling it Father “right”. This is linked to the control of women for essentially seventh-century economic reasons but is today presented as a twenty-first-century moral necessity. It seems to have become a political requirement adopted by many men and women within the Islamic faith and is being reflected widely in the wearing of hijab and less widely in the demand for Sharia law with all its seventh-century moral simplicity.\nSo how are the Elite managing this complex situation all of it of their rather than our making? They do not seem to have seen their folly and have not apologised to their own working people or the people of the bombed Middle East. They have not apologised to their Nation’s economically active and liberated women or the children abused in various ways in the name of ‘faith’, culture or both. They have not talked down the politics of seventh-century radical Islam by assertively promoting our values of contract, choice and consent. Instead, they have tried to manage opinion to prevent working people complaining too much and have compromised the future of generations of women by ignoring the flagrant hostility from some radicals towards some outspoken women. We need to assist any faith that theologically and doctrinally has no respect for individual rights and freedoms particularly those that empower women economically. There may be some people within the faith of Islam who do accept the principles of the Enlightenment, but when you research the Quran, Hadith and Islamic history it seems likely that out of fear they are a few brave souls indeed. So, what does the overall picture of the West look like?\n- Societal and moral decline amplified within the context of declining economic power and influence\n- An Elite who have developed exaggerated expectations of their own economic and political power\n- Following the 2007/8 collapse, an economic ‘revival’ paid for by indebting working people and creating low paid jobs.\n- Failed wars of reconstruction leading to mass migration\n- A clash of ideologies between the enlightened West and a large migrant population from feudal systems often with pre-capitalist moral principles.\n- An elite that having turned Westworld’s workers into serfs, (paying for the Elite’s power and wealth with debt and taxes) begins to roll back the values of the enlightenment and the principles of contract, choice and consent.\n- An elite who realise their Nations can’t pay for the State bureaucracy and for them as well as pay for the consequences of their and our, Western moral decline.\nSo, what of the future? We all need to reflect on the challenges facing the Western world because the health of the West affects the health of the rest. We need to avoid the easy conclusion our political class and global Elite are there to sort it out. They really can’t because the West’s political systems are not set up to allow them to. Indeed, the experience of London under Khan and Trudeau in Canada confirms that things can be frighteningly unpredictable within our eighteenth-century political systems. With binary systems, ideology can flip into something unacceptable to ordinary people and flip on the outcome of one election, as with the knife crime epidemic in London. So, what conclusions can we draw?\nFirstly, the Elites current economic strategy won’t work because you can’t borrow to spend and spend to borrow. The Westworld needs real social and economic value (business and profitability) and value is out there in the wider world, but the elite can’t conceive of how to get it, because it means bringing down trade barriers and giving more power to the people. Their failed strategy was to take up arms in the Middle East to get some added value that way and thankfully they no longer have the money or the inclination. They would rather spend what money they take from us on themselves, which is good news for the peace of the world in general.\nSecondly, the Westworld worker is a global player with global values and can trade freely when given the freedom to do so. With ‘hot’ war largely a non-starter we all need to demand a system that allows us all to engage in sorting out Westworld’s problems. the Elite need to unshackle the power of the Western working people. Trade is the bringer of peace. It always has been, and we need to do more of it not less, so we need to empower the Western worker to go out into the world as in the 18th century and trade. The Elite need to ask us our opinion before deciding on a policy that affects us and not them!\nThirdly the Westworld worker is someone who believes in the enlightenment and the principles of contract, choice and consent and can easily identify those who don’t. Those who don’t consist of our Elite and those for whom discrimination against freedom and the promotion of control, coercion and compulsion are articles of faith including a growing number within our so-called ‘left wing’. Marx would have hated the West’s current ‘Left-wing’ made up as it is of too many narcissistic economic illiterates.\nFourthly we Westworld workers need to stop allowing the Elite and the ‘thick’ end of the left to differentiate us and turn us against one another based on bogus criteria like religion, sexuality or class. If we believe in western values, we should not support politicians who clearly don’t. Become radical, because after hundreds of years of exploitation we are one group of workers at last because we all share the same values even if we differ on policy detail. And we should remember it is our values that are at risk.\nAnd finally, start to take the argument to the institutions that have landed us where we are today.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-uk-labour-party-socialism-and-the-state/content_150.html": "The UK Labour Party, ‘Socialism’ and the State.\nMarx was a classical economist which explains why he wanted actual workers to ‘own’ the means of production. Workers, free from the need to work longer hours than necessary would have time off for politics, recreation and family life. Capitalists, of course, exploited workers by taking workers working hours so they could make a profit (Capital) and become, like an aristocracy. An aristocracy based on wealth acquisition rather than inherited status. Like elites, they forced additional effort from the workers but without actually going as far as killing them. Capitalists needed a workforce.\nSocialism is the reaction of the State to that exploitative situation. A ‘socialist’ State takes the wealth from the capitalist and spends it on the workers. It doesn’t, however, go as far as giving the workers the ‘means of production’ but offers welfare etc. Workers still have to work the capitalists hours.\nWorkers are thus exploited by the State! Go too far with this model however and the State not only undermines the systems productive capacity it enslaves the workers as well. ‘Socialist’ States thus stop serving the workers and start to serve themselves. Hitler/Stalin/Mao get into power promoting the rights of workers but end up enslaving the working class……and often killing them.\nToday we have a ‘Left-wing’ of such obvious naivety it has no idea what it’s role is supposed to be in what is in effect a 21st-century post ‘capitalist’ age.\nTo maintain its relevance as a ‘socialist’ party the Labour Party gathers together a collection of senior State and charity employees plus a massive constituency of the politically lame and out of touch. It became a party of minority and sectarian interests united in the belief that any ‘identity’ other than ‘worker’ is radical even if the identity is simply not being a Tory. Identity without economic relevance is utopian nonsense. There is no united, militant economically exploited industrial working class anymore, just a big bunch of people who hate their lives, the Tories, real workers with Brexit opinions and probably each other\nThe left cannot depart from its historical self-belief or their faith in the transformative power of the socialist State because it is ‘socialist’ and proudly so. But it is no longer revolutionary. Its revolution was fought, won and then became irrelevant between 1945 and 1979.\nSocialism is now is now counter-revolutionary. It’s trying to persuade its members and voters to once again empower a socialist State and in doing so undermine the working people. Under socialism, empowering workers has never been on the cards. Socialism is all about the State.\nThe next revolution we get must to minimise the cost of the State and politically empower the workers. Socialism won’t do that because it can’t.",

This anthropological trope goes back to tribal times. Women had women’s roles and men there role. Homosexuality was a threat to the tribe in numerous ways so punishment for this “difference” was harsh. Adultery likewise. As humankind began to evolve via technologies like farming, maintenance of this primitive “status quo” became a challenge taken up by Leading men for example kings. Since our earliest times, there has been a tension between those demanding economic and social change and those attempting to preserve the status quo.\nFrom biblical times to the late 16th Century little in the known world changed. What had always been wrong continued to be wrong. What needed to continue, continued. The wealth created by the economic activity from Bible times to the 16th century found its way into the hands of an elite. The gender discrimination first practised in tribal times was still found in what has become known as the feudal world. There was no impetus to change this because the world still needed this difference.\nGender difference, prohibitions against “choice” and “consent” and an absence of any “rights” not sanctioned by an overlord was a reality for everyone. However, for women, the first form of fascism was mans’ dominion over them and until comparatively recently all cultures accepted it.\nWhilst the wars during this long millennial period were about territory and faith there was little difference in the defined role of the vanquished men and women. What we would describe today as discrimination flourished.\nFor everyone, men and women there was no Contract, Choice or Consent. This arrived in the late 17th early 18th century when things slowly start to change. Commerce needed the freedom to trade on agreed terms upheld by law and eventually, the old order yielded to new ways of doing the nation’s business. This development can’t be underestimated. Whilst the old tribal distinctions prevailed between men and women, in a legal sense these new principles of contract, choice and consent could in theory at least apply to women too. Man’s 10,000 year dominion over womenkind was for the first time weakened by the birth of capitalism. The history since the 18th century has been the history of an economic model, capitalism, delivering abundant wealth with associated inequality but paying for positive social change most often with a big poke from a progressive government.\nThe left would never admit to it but the rights and freedoms all minorities enjoy whether they are women, gay, queer or whatever, they enjoy because they are formed from economic rules that have over 200 years acquired a social character. Marx was the first to recognise this process. No one in the West seriously questions these social rights to contract freely, consent to what happens to you and to choose your lifestyle. However, they may be under threat, and not only because capitalism has morphed into a dark shadow self..the crony controlled “free market”.\nOur ignorance of where our rights come from plus from the Left-wing an open and vitriolic hatred of capitalism and the free market threatens capitalisms enduring legacy of rights. It also threatens the existence of other benefits that accompany them such as our democratic freedoms of conscience and speech. The challenge is, of course, made more acute because capitalism as it was understood when it was forging our rights, no longer exists. It has been replaced by a crony “capitalist” free market economy which has seen employment exported east and low paid workers coming west. There are legitimate reasons to dislike the free market but abolishing economic freedom and replacing it with government ownership will not protect rights. As in the 1970’s it will turn workers against taxpayers!\nThis newly emboldened orthodox Left wing in the UK is starting to erode freedom of conscience and speech within the Labour Party. This arises because they don’t understand why legal principles like contract, choice and consent are essential to maintaining a fair and free society for everyone. Look at countries that have not socialised these economic freedoms and you still find discrimination ie certain parts of Africa. Look at countries who have never had to accept these principles and you have a tyranny ie Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan.\nIf you have state involvement in the economy as we have today it is important that the economy is as free as possible. The importance of economic freedom in legitimising and maintaining social freedoms can’t be underestimated protecting things like gender rights is a function of a free society based on a free economy.\nThe orthodox Left has failed to grasp that whilst economic freedom is bourgeois it must be maintained as it underpins all anti-discrimination policy. This is because people essentially workers or consumers and are therefore able to exercise the same rights whoever they are. The Left’s failure to grasp this makes them fellow travellers with those who oppress others and makes them, and those who support them, a potential threat to our free safe society where everyone now has the same slate of rights.\nIf the Left pursue their 19th-century agenda they will succeed only in throwing the equality baby out with the bourgeois bath water!",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_muslim-foster-carers-and-a-christian-child-in-their-care-should-there-really-be-a-story/content_379.html": "Muslim foster carers and a “Christian” child in their care. Should there really be a story?\nNo of course not. In 21st Century Britain there should be no issue with this. Baroness Warsi would make a great foster mum. She is bright ambitious, well connected and we assume able to square the rights of post industrial westerners with her own possible faith based reservations about a range of western identity pre occupations like sexuality or gender reassignment.\nBaroness Warsi, however, was not the foster mum in the recent Uk “Times” story. The foster mum concerned was photographed shrouded in black. The purpose of this traditional dress is that it ensures women observe very strict codes of modesty. This is irrespective of how the woman might feel about this, or indeed how a foster child may view it. The collective pressure of her community and the disapproval of others ensures compliance by te woman concerned.\nNo little girl “Christian” or otherwise should be encouraged to see women as an object of adolescent like male lust. An object that should be shrouded to prevent community disapproval, punishment or in the case of white girls in Rochdale etc the most appalling and degrading abuse.\nAre there any other issues that arise from this sad story about cultural incompatibility? Well yes. Taking a traditional view of a woman’s need for modesty should prompt the local Social Services team to ask further probing questions about the wider rights of women and girls and perhaps how the prospective foster carer views the rights of others like gay people or apostates etc (we should ask similar questions before granting citizenship).\nWe suspect that these questions are not asked. If they were we suspect that too many religiously observant foster carers would be considered highly unsuitable, and that seems to be Ok as long as their faith is Christan or rather non-Muslim. It’s Ok to have a go at Christians or others, they don’t hit back. This illustrates the point we at Blue Revolution make all the time and that is that in the land of the hard left London Boroughs, the general concern for individual rights including rights under the broad banner of “identity politics” can be set aside in deference to the Islamic faith. But why?\nA recent programme on BBC radio 4 covered the subject of Princess Diana. A feminist author took the view that Diana was a practitioner of “victim feminism”. We are not experts on feminism but it sounds like victim feminism is based on the idea that if you claim to be abused, discriminated against and demeaned you have a right to be angry, demand approval, forgiveness, and support, in essence, given “permission” to behave how you like.\nIs this what is happening within our western culture with our reaction to the orthodox observance of Islam? It may be that there are two battles going on against the West by Islamists and Islamophiles. One is fought out in the courts by Islamophile human rights Barristers all claiming special status for Islam as a persecuted and victimised faith. Whilst in Parliament the Civil Service and numerous Council chambers “victim” status is established for Islam scaring social workers, police officers and the like into acquiescence on a range of its cultural peculiarities.\nThe other battle goes on on the streets. On the streets where the cause of Islamophobia has its roots, where Islamism shows its aggressive and murderous side along side it’s general incompatibility with modern values linked to the rights of the individual. There is little if any Contract, Choice, and Consent in orthodox Islam and you can’t expect there to be. These are western notions forged in the white heat of capitalism and industrialization, which are alien to cultural Islam.\nThe lessons from this sorry tale of the little foster child are that whilst we should not in post industrial 21st century Britain be worried about anyone being fostered by anyone of faith, unfortunately, we have to be when that faith is orthodox observant Islam. Practitioners of orthodox Islam in almost all cases will hold beliefs that contradict a whole range of individual rights identity rights, and modern values. Beliefs that certainly won’t be compatible with the Human Rights Act such as the basic right of gay men to have a life or a woman to be sexually liberated from control by her “guardian” male.\nWith the skillful application of victim status by Human Rights Barristers within the British legal system and with a left wing Islamophle local government bureaucracy more than happy to champion these “faith victims” above all others, the dialogue with practitioners of orthodox Islam is silenced. We need a grown up conversation, not about Islam but about the values people bring to roles like fostering. The lack of this dialogue is what fuels Islamophobia. Shame on the establishment for letting the people down again!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_decoding-structural-disadvantage-simplified/content_99.html": "Decoding Structural Disadvantage, Simplified\nWe hear the term ‘structural disadvantage’ a lot. Because of so called structural disadvantage we are encouraged to ‘take the knee’, to see the consequences of structural disadvantage in terms linked to race or maybe some other identity.\nDo people including politicians really understand structural disadvantage? You know, what the term really means. and how do they prove its existence? If asked, most will tell you it is about discrimination. This seems odd given that state organisations ‘the state structure’ is very keen to be ‘inclusive’ and ‘anti-discriminatory’. The idea therefore that the state and nation are complicit in discriminating against minorities seems a little farfetched. The law prohibits discrimination and backs this up with sanctions for discriminating. So where does the evidence come from that structural disadvantage exists and discriminates, and its racial.\nIt is certainly the case that people who are black or from other minority groups suffer the effects of structural disadvantage and when that happens is easy to call it racial discrimination thus linking structural discrimination to race alone. This does seem to be a habitual tick of the authoritarian left wing, perhaps because it provides a stick with which to beat the so-called right wing ‘establishment’. After all racial or not, structural disadvantage is maintained by the state establishment but that includes the past left wing ‘Blairite’ establishment too. Therefore, we must ask is structural disadvantage about more than racial identity, is it more about social class irrespective of race?\nBy making the claim that structural disadvantage is race based and imploring us all to take the knee in support of the disadvantaged black community, we ignore the fact that many other people who are not from ethnic minorities suffer structural disadvantage too, poor white people for example. By putting the emphasis on race as opposed to class, it allows the political establishment to maintain the class system based on wealth and privilege whilst they blame poor, white people for both their own structural disadvantage and the structural disadvantage of the black community. This is because structural disadvantage, or so the narrative goes, only affects black people. and can’t possibly affect white people because they might be poor and excluded but they are also white.\nBy claiming the effects of structural disadvantage are only linked to the colour of a person’s skin the establishment neutralise legitimate demands to tackle structural disadvantage and exclusion. If its all about race according to the privileged elite, we should just tackle racism.\nSo, if we accept that structural disadvantage is not just about race but is about disadvantage to some black people within the wider class of disadvantaged individual’s we need to find a more complex way of describing it. The idea it is about race is simply not adequate as structural disadvantage traps people of every ethnic group.\nSo, what are the mechanics of structural disadvantage then? Well, we could all come up with some ideas, welfare systems that act like traps rather than safety nets, poor education systems that do not raise aspiration, or maybe it is to do with aspiration versus entitlement. Anyone familiar with ‘posh’ people knows how super confident they are, regardless of actual ability.\nNone of these is sufficient to explain why once people slide down the social and economic system they too often slide out and struggle to get back in. They become demotivated and maybe even criminal. Tackling the consequences of structural disadvantage in the way Tony Blair did with the repot by the poverty commission identifying housing, drug and alcohol misuse or thinking and behavioural deficits has not resulted in the number structurally disadvantaged decreasing. The numbers still climb up. Ok so what does explain structural disadvantage?\nFirstly, we have a culture, still beholden to principles like just desserts, or you get what you deserve. This means that we do not really think failure is created by society and disadvantage imposed intergenerationally based on class, we typically view failure as a personal thing, and the consequences deserved. On this basis those who fail can only blame themselves.\nStrangely so established is this belief that it works with the rich too as we see those who succeed as being responsible for their success, even if their advantage is inherited, someone like Donald Trump for example. Failure is therefore not seen as arising from inherited disadvantage, but personal failure with a lot of justified adverse consequences to boot. Without being made aware of the mechanics of this process we are all prone to accept. We praise the children of famous people who become famous themselves and have ‘puff’ pieces published in the Sunday Times, and yet we can’t accept failure has a similar origin, so we condemn the failures and believe they should get their ‘just desserts’.\nSo in our western world, each of us gets our ‘just deserts’. In the criminal justice system, we do not understand why the petty offender has never risen above crime. It is the just deserts imposed on them by a society that believes they deserve to be at the bottom of the pile.\nTo add to the problems created by a general and widespread feeling about the trappings of success and failure being deserved we have another principle that adversely affects the chances of those at the bottom of societies pile and that principle is the principle of lesser eligibility.\nThere has been some attempt made to mitigate the hard application of this Victorian principle. The welfare system dovetails a little better to support those who undertake at least some work but in respect of the unemployed, the reality is different. Local housing allowances make it impossible to escape the welfare trap once homelessness becomes a feature of your exclusion. The whole system is structured to ensure that the poor who are right at the bottom of the social pile are rarely able to escape welfare. There are homelessness charities that need a ready supply of ‘clients’ to justify their existence. The interplay of housing welfare and general welfare is the most powerful example of ‘structural disadvantage’. Rather than levelling down, we pretend we can lift these people up. In the current system we cannot, we lift up their ‘helpers’. Even Michael X the notorious black activist come drug dealer noted this point.\nFinally, the last and most invisible form of structural disadvantage we at Blue Revolution call the bureaucratisation or managerialsing of leadership. In effect, the leaders we select are selected based on how well they operate within the impersonal world of the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy has a kind of ‘humanity’ built into it, but it is in the form of appraisals, reward and recognition.\nThe language of bureaucracy is structurally disadvantaging of all those who for whatever reason do not possess the language, behavioural and educational codes that gain access to this system. Whatever we term these people, outcasts, failures, ‘mavericks’ or outsiders, they are overrepresented within the minority ethnic and other groups. It would be easy to say that the system was at fault, but the ‘liberal types’ who control the system would not accept that to be the case. ‘General racism’ is given as the cause and we are all encouraged to take the knee’ or to blame white history but never to identify the bureaucratisation of leadership, particularly guilt afflicted white leadership as the problem. To correct this, we simply need to do the same thing we do with all the forms of structural disadvantage, we level down, trust people to make the right choices about who they want as their leaders and stop pandering to the idea we can level up or the state and its bureaucratic apparatus is neutral, inclusive and fair. It is not.",

The UK, Canada, and the US plus of course the European Union. Westworld has subsidiaries in South America and the Middle East.\nIt doesn’t seem a day goes by without more and more evidence of a crisis in Westworld. We know the symptoms: mass immigration, failure to integrate by large groups of people from places like North Africa, economic stagnation remedied by debt and an apparent disdain by our ‘Elite’ for the values of the Enlightenment, reflected in the apparent promotion of values hostile to ordinary worker’s freedom of speech. Enlightenment values of freedom and rationality underpin the principles of capitalism: namely contract, choice and consent and with them came our precious, albeit limited democracy.\nSo, what has gone wrong? Is it class warfare? is it a conspiracy by the Elite to control working people? Is it global backhanders from Saudi princes? is it naive top-down Cultural Marxism gone mad? Is it an exhausted liberalism and welfarism that has simply given up in the face of a moral onslaught from some individuals from the Islamic world and particularly North Africa and the Middle East? Is it the birth of a new global economic model?\nOr is it a bit of all of them?\nWelfare hasn’t really helped the West, but it may be unavoidable in a world of declining economic strength. There is no doubt that the social reform agenda that has been delivered since the end of World War two it has been a mixed blessing. Policies, like liberating the gay community a social and economic good, reducing hatred and fear within our communities and bringing the gay community foursquare into huge areas of economic productivity, has proven popular and progressive. Abortion became a necessary evil, it prevented misery for women and along with the contraceptive pill liberated them from a life with limited choices. Limited choices for women are once again being promoted by some within some incumbent faith communities using religious text as a justification.\nLiberalising the Divorce Laws was again necessary, preventing a lot of misery for adults whilst an unintended consequence has been passing misery and depression onto many children. The economic aim was perhaps to maintain parents in the workplace and increase overall consumption (two TV’s as opposed to one!), whilst unintentionally rendering too many young people damaged by early adulthood and therefore economically inactive; the consequence of a “messy” divorce. It isn’t divorce, that is the problem, of course, it is the ease by which adults feel able to have children who then get embroiled in the emotional horror of the divorce itself. That is perhaps down to welfare again. It may also link to the economic uncertainties being created by the exhausted capitalist system as it rolls back to the West displacing whole nations from the value-creating juggernaut of capitalism or simply leaving people behind at home.\nThese are three big-ticket ‘social’ reforms of the post-war era. However, the impact has been different in respect of each. The latter two have left an unintended and expensive legacy both socially and economically. But we are where we are here in Westworld and no one would want to reverse the social progress achieved so far.\nWith capitalism only thriving in the Far East and China both active on the economic world stage, Westworld has been left with a legacy of unachievable moral and social expectations, declining economies and debt. With a white-faced Anglo-Saxon elite realising that the world that made them rich or powerful or both is in a state of permanent decline, they are forced to look around for a fashionable theory or policy to revitalise that which made them who they are. Now it all seems to have failed they consolidate their privileged position and then give up trying to advance ours, in fact, they make matters worse for working people by trying to place the guilt for the consequences of their failure on us in the form of ‘white privilege’.\nThe Elites incompetence has come close to killing the economic goose that once laid capitalism’s golden egg. But the goose isn’t dead because the Westworld working people are becoming an economically literate and motivated radical force driven by anger and constrained only by the old-world order of financial and social privilege. This hegemonic system will have to be burst asunder before the workers of the West can be liberated from the oppressive control of our Elites.\nIf our Elite continues to oversee the world’s economic affairs the Western economies are doomed. Hiding behind the protectionism of Trump’s ‘America first’, or the EU Customs Union the Western world is heading towards economic stagnation. As a result, our culture is at risk of being overwhelmed in places by the ancient simplicities of Nationalism or resurgent Islam offering solutions to Westworld’s social problems and emboldened in their determination to change our way of life by the power of engineered mass migration.\nThe Islamic world may believe it has some solutions to the Westworld moral crisis, but this simply isn’t the case. Islam has a poor track record of furthering economic and social evolution. Following a period of renaissance when Islam ‘secularised’ in the 12th century, when it became feudal, the various iterations of the faith since then would impede the evolution of the Middle East from then on with only a brief ‘enlightenment’ from the 19th to mid-20th century as capitalism held sway and again secular reform was intended to bring prosperity across the Muslim world. As crony capitalism has failed across the West and the Middle East some Islamic nations have re-adopted Sharia as opposed to secular constitutions. What else should be the response to economic stagnation in the 20th and 21st century Middle East one might ask. Well, a rebooted capitalism with the demand that its values are progressed to all people.\nOil money in the twenty-first century is offering some ‘progressive’ development of a very limited and questionable sort in Saudi Arabia a country promoting fundamentalist Islam around the world, but a country that without oil wouldn’t exist as a viable nation-state. So, with capitalism collapsing in the weaker Islamic nations and Islam as a faith resurgent and confident, the Westworld worker has street corner theologians shouting down our values as our utterly lost Elite turn a blind eye. Westworld has its own dodgy theologians of course.\nWhen one listens to the theologians of Westworld, in the US the Clintons and Obama, in UK Blair and Nick Clegg, in the EU every technocrat with a microphone and in Canada Justin Trudeau one can see people who simply can’t grasp the concept that the system that made them rich is finished. Whilst the system may have finished for them however, it has plenty of life in it, if it is given to the people at large. The Elite seem unwilling to do that and we are therefore at risk of having our culture compromised by advancing ideologies of Nationalism or from some quarters a demand for the promotion of radical or even just observant Islam. Both would limit the rights of working people. Therefore in creating the demand for repressive change, our Elite is now a threat to us, Westworld’s working people like never before. So, what are the causes of the Elite’s and our collective crisis?\nAt the top of the political sphere, the Elite promote the old-fashioned idea that debt unconnected with investment can be a stimulus to growth. They have also embarked upon regeneration wars to bomb democracy into the Middle East and North Africa, whilst hoping to reconstruct these places using Western firms and Middle Eastern oil money. The consequence was as we know complete failure. Additionally, in rubble-strewn failed states Islamism becomes coherent as a way of ordering an otherwise chaotic society, so the world got ISIS. ISIS of course inspired by the hard-line Sunni Muslims of Saudi Arabia promote the example of seventh century Mohammad as a major influence on their way of life, a life of shameless brutality.\nOn the home front and for working people welfare has unavoidably become the Elite’s replacement for real social and economic value creating employment. Within the context of declining economies and a new reliance on debt, there is the illusion of a vibrant free market economy which whilst failing to keep the West on top economically has continued to reassure the Elite that life for them is business as usual. They have allowed a mechanism to be engineered by the banking system and global markets that turn our debt (national and personal) into wealth for them and their cronies. Of course, it brought us to our knees in 2007/08 and today we are back on the same horse.\nIf we pick up from 2007/8 the Elite have managed to save themselves and convince themselves, they have saved us but only by working the biggest confidence trick in modern history. They have turned the Westworld workers into a new class of twenty-first-century Serfs. We now pay taxes, service National and personal debt and spend what money we must ensure the Westworld economy looks like it is functioning when, like putting compressed air through a steam engine rather than steam, it just looks like it is working. This is a ‘Wizard of Oz’ illusion. The Emerald City of the Clintons, Blairs, EU and others involves workers giving away our good jobs, our productive capacity, plus amassing debt on an eye-watering scale to keep the elite in their positions of power and influence. They can use the banks and the Wests 18th century political systems and associated institutions to maintain their illusion and of course, they do.\nTheir wars of ‘reconstruction’ have burdened the working people with an additional problem. Migration. Not Migration from places with a cultural heritage of the Enlightenment and Contract, Choice and Consent but migration from places with a pre-capitalist feudal-like and simple worldview based on control, coercion and compulsion and for many this is linked to belief in the infallibility of the Quran and Hadith. The wars of reconstruction have failed, but the elite has it that migration has always been good at stimulating growth. Well yes and no. It depends on who is coming in. The Jewish community that came before and during World War two undoubtedly contributed a great deal to post War Britain’s economic reconstruction.\nThe Windrush generation added much socially and culturally but was probably less significant in economic terms and the most recent arrivals sadly seem to have added very little. Many have either taken low skilled work or some having pre-capitalist values of submission, have introduced a form of multi valueism in the West offering to compete with Western values. This has wrong-footed the Elite as previously their multiculturalism was set within a thriving capitalist framework and was the West’s expectation, not value systems competing within the Nation States themselves.\nThe lack of thriving capitalism is what has exposed the difference in values and made them so stark causing fear within all communities; established and newly arrived. The big debate is whether this has been a deliberate policy by the global elite to alter Western society. Our view is probably not. It’s just the consequence of everything we have described above and the Elite not knowing what to do about it.\nOne specific challenge to Western values comes in the requirement of Islam as a faith for men and women to be treated with differential standards and expectations. Something Karl Marx and Frederick Engels disapproved of, calling it Father “right”. This is linked to the control of women for essentially seventh-century economic reasons but is today presented as a twenty-first-century moral necessity. It seems to have become a political requirement adopted by many men and women within the Islamic faith and is being reflected widely in the wearing of hijab and less widely in the demand for Sharia law with all its seventh-century moral simplicity.\nSo how are the Elite managing this complex situation all of it of their rather than our making? They do not seem to have seen their folly and have not apologised to their own working people or the people of the bombed Middle East. They have not apologised to their Nation’s economically active and liberated women or the children abused in various ways in the name of ‘faith’, culture or both. They have not talked down the politics of seventh-century radical Islam by assertively promoting our values of contract, choice and consent. Instead, they have tried to manage opinion to prevent working people complaining too much and have compromised the future of generations of women by ignoring the flagrant hostility from some radicals towards some outspoken women. We need to assist any faith that theologically and doctrinally has no respect for individual rights and freedoms particularly those that empower women economically. There may be some people within the faith of Islam who do accept the principles of the Enlightenment, but when you research the Quran, Hadith and Islamic history it seems likely that out of fear they are a few brave souls indeed. So, what does the overall picture of the West look like?\n- Societal and moral decline amplified within the context of declining economic power and influence\n- An Elite who have developed exaggerated expectations of their own economic and political power\n- Following the 2007/8 collapse, an economic ‘revival’ paid for by indebting working people and creating low paid jobs.\n- Failed wars of reconstruction leading to mass migration\n- A clash of ideologies between the enlightened West and a large migrant population from feudal systems often with pre-capitalist moral principles.\n- An elite that having turned Westworld’s workers into serfs, (paying for the Elite’s power and wealth with debt and taxes) begins to roll back the values of the enlightenment and the principles of contract, choice and consent.\n- An elite who realise their Nations can’t pay for the State bureaucracy and for them as well as pay for the consequences of their and our, Western moral decline.\nSo, what of the future? We all need to reflect on the challenges facing the Western world because the health of the West affects the health of the rest. We need to avoid the easy conclusion our political class and global Elite are there to sort it out. They really can’t because the West’s political systems are not set up to allow them to. Indeed, the experience of London under Khan and Trudeau in Canada confirms that things can be frighteningly unpredictable within our eighteenth-century political systems. With binary systems, ideology can flip into something unacceptable to ordinary people and flip on the outcome of one election, as with the knife crime epidemic in London. So, what conclusions can we draw?\nFirstly, the Elites current economic strategy won’t work because you can’t borrow to spend and spend to borrow. The Westworld needs real social and economic value (business and profitability) and value is out there in the wider world, but the elite can’t conceive of how to get it, because it means bringing down trade barriers and giving more power to the people. Their failed strategy was to take up arms in the Middle East to get some added value that way and thankfully they no longer have the money or the inclination. They would rather spend what money they take from us on themselves, which is good news for the peace of the world in general.\nSecondly, the Westworld worker is a global player with global values and can trade freely when given the freedom to do so. With ‘hot’ war largely a non-starter we all need to demand a system that allows us all to engage in sorting out Westworld’s problems. the Elite need to unshackle the power of the Western working people. Trade is the bringer of peace. It always has been, and we need to do more of it not less, so we need to empower the Western worker to go out into the world as in the 18th century and trade. The Elite need to ask us our opinion before deciding on a policy that affects us and not them!\nThirdly the Westworld worker is someone who believes in the enlightenment and the principles of contract, choice and consent and can easily identify those who don’t. Those who don’t consist of our Elite and those for whom discrimination against freedom and the promotion of control, coercion and compulsion are articles of faith including a growing number within our so-called ‘left wing’. Marx would have hated the West’s current ‘Left-wing’ made up as it is of too many narcissistic economic illiterates.\nFourthly we Westworld workers need to stop allowing the Elite and the ‘thick’ end of the left to differentiate us and turn us against one another based on bogus criteria like religion, sexuality or class. If we believe in western values, we should not support politicians who clearly don’t. Become radical, because after hundreds of years of exploitation we are one group of workers at last because we all share the same values even if we differ on policy detail. And we should remember it is our values that are at risk.\nAnd finally, start to take the argument to the institutions that have landed us where we are today. Our 18th-century political system (not our enlightenment values), our mainstream media in the UK the BBC and Channel 4. The Church of England and all those Episcopal churches that seem to be handmaidens to any and every regressive faith going.\nWe should all shout about the importance of freedom and equality, identify those who don’t and humiliate them into silence. Over hundreds of years our values have made the world prosperous whilst most of the rest of the world was either to fractious or obsessed with doctrinal observance and submission. The Western world’s workers still have much to achieve in liberating ourselves and the workers of the world in general and we don’t want or need an elite to help us achieve it. Indeed, they ceased to be any help decades ago.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_politicians-lack-integrity-but-so-does-the-whole-political-system/content_158.html": "Politicians’ lack integrity, but so does the whole political system.\nWhen I first became a councillor there was a standards committee. It seemed to spend a lot of time hearing grievances and counter grievances by various councillors some of whom used it to settle scores or take revenge for perceived slights.\nThankfully it was eventually abolished.\nToday politics is increasingly mired in petty score settling and grievance taking. So, I personally struggle to apply the ambition of this code of corporate governance as it relates to the councillor’s behaviour with the reality of our current Party-based political settlement.\nIn particular, I struggle with the word integrity, which is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. Political integrity is something personal, something known only to the individual who acts with integrity, and it is difficult to achieve integrity within our current political arrangements.\nThe public no longer turns out to vote as they did in the past because I assert, they know there is something wrong with the way modern politics works. They suspect when observing politics that there is a lack of integrity by politicians translating into a lack of integrity within the whole system. Yet we are required to demonstrate integrity and adhere to ‘standards of behaviour enshrined in codes of conduct and protocols. It’s a bit late for that.\nMaybe it’s because the authors of these blueprints for codes of conduct and protocols can see that politics as we have understood for over two hundred years is now failing, and bringing the whole political realm into disrepute that they try to ‘fix it’ with policy. But you can’t make a democratic silk purse out of a political sow’s ear.\nFor far too long politics has been destructive rather than constructive, collectively bringing down your opponent or their administration. It’s binary, adversarial, and polarising. The psychology behind it is childlike in its simplicity and is appealing to some people for that reason. It’s ‘attack and defend’ Politics for the playground bully.\nTo the political outsider, it looks self-indulgent, they see self-aggrandising, grandstanding politicians of every stripe as the typical characters of the political class.\nIt has not always been like this, because at one time there was an argument that binary politics was crudely class-based and thus tribal loyalty conferred a sort of integrity. Today this is not the case, politics increasingly represents only itself, its processes, systems and procedures, too often undermining integrity by forcing people to vote collectively often against their better instincts.\nAllied to this is a new and troubling phenomenon the ad hominem attack, or gaslighting. Because of declining economic opportunities and little actual influence locally, nationally, or globally, old-fashioned Party politics has to find a way to still look relevant.\nTherefore, rather than listen to other people’s ideas and debate them, we criticise each other’s intelligence, charisma, values, motives, morality, honesty, and behaviour. Looking away from policy because there probably aren’t any policies and therefore attacking opponents as people, rather than attacking their ideas is easy and is increasingly the only thing left for Party politicians to do.\nGiven the lamentable state of Party politics I’d say we don’t need any more, grandstanding political parties, or indeed a code of conduct covering politicians’ integrity, we need a revolution within our increasingly unfit-for-purpose 18th-century political system.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-western-world-needs-to-consider-why-our-culture-lacks-worldwide-appeal-we-consider-some-ideas/content_139.html": "The western world needs to consider why our culture lacks worldwide appeal. We consider some ideas.\nThe western world has progressed from tribalism through to the current “free market” which is an evolved form of capitalism. Capitalism, of course, required the creation of economic value. This economic value is essentially the profit after labour and other costs have been deducted from the sale price. Economic value is necessary whether one is a fan of capitalism or one is a Marxist. For fans of capitalism, the economic value is ‘rightly’ owned by the capitalist making him or her very rich. For the Marxist, the economic value is ‘stolen’ by the capitalist and is rightly the property of the workers. This is where the Marxist axiom “all property is theft” comes from.\nThe process of capitalism required as we have said before the development of the legal concepts of contract, choice and consent. Over two hundred years or more these legal concepts have taken on a ‘social character’ and are widely understood in the western world to underpin all social rights, equalities and freedoms including women’s rights, rights to ones sexuality and our different types of democracy. However, within the context of capitalism whether one agrees with the way value is distributed or not our freedoms were underpinned by a moral system that created value via production of goods for sale. This productive context has been replaced with the largely amoral ‘free market’ which sells product but doesn’t produce it.\nSo here is the crux of the problem. The western world has become dependent not on production to create value but by debt to create consumption. The whole thing is geared through various markets which drive the industrialisation of activities from marriage to education to pornography. Some people get very rich as actual production goes on in low wage economies whilst indigenous workers get low wages or welfare for servicing the ‘consumption economy’.\nWith debt driving consumption and consumption driving the free market the planet is put under increasing strain. There is no balance to this system. Debt based money is easy to come by as the price of assets like housing underpin the debt which then drives the consumption. It will fail again and spectacularly. That is the number one reason why many non-western countries dislike our western culture. They can see it is unsustainable.\nReason number two that there is a widespread dislike of the western world is that the ‘free market’ turns everyone into a tradable commodity. No longer an employee within an economic context based on work and production but a consumer to either consume or be consumed or both. This disassociation makes people lose their humanity and engage in activities that would in any more traditional society be seen as shameful, illegal or immodest.\nWe used the phrase ‘secularphobia’ to describe the fear of western culture by more traditional people of faith. This secular phobia is really a fear of the free market and its drive to expand consumption with debt. If we don’t find a way to stop the relentless drive for debt based growth our culture of freedom based on contract, choice and consent will end with the inevitable collapse of the free market. With that collapse will end the economic necessity for contract choice and consent will also end and we could find those who perhaps find our culture has no appeal will have the last laugh. What will happen to our western values then. We and we mean the vast majority of middle class, lower middle and working class people could end up being pauperised with a new political elite acting as overlord in a system that owes more to feudalism than democracy. A bit like China today!",

But still the Tories should be worried.\nLet us just take a few issues. A lack of cultural integration, a debt based economy, an inefficient state sector that is barely democratic, a legal system too elite, remote and expensive for most to access, a political system designed to promote the interests of groups in binary opposition, a criminal justice system that still sees imprisonment as the ultimate sanction irrespective of whether the criminal is a danger to the public, a housing bubble that feeds the economy with debt and services the financial sector whilst relying on immigration and family breakdown to fuel the demand for more housing. A student demographic who can anticipate a form of pauperism as they progress asset-less and debt-burdened into the mid 21st century. We could go on but it is too depressing.\nWhat is needed is a revolution but not the big state oppression promised to the youth by Corbyn. His brand of socialism will not offer the young what they want, freedom, equality and opportunity but more state indebtedness, a lack of freedom in the economy and a perverse array of special pleading that will capture and sustain inequality within Labours various client groups. This is as we have said before largely gender inequality but could conceivably be anti-Semitic or homophobic so large and weird is Labours “big tent”.\nThe problem for the Tories is that Labours rubbish revolution is the only one in town and whilst he is moving backwards at least Corbyn is moving. The Tories, by contrast, have lost the optimism and vision that saw many of them, quite rightly lead the Brexit campaign on the basis of a global role for Britain in a world crying out for a new form of efficient values based 21s century leadership in a western world full of creaking and expensive post-war bureaucracies, just like the EU run by elites on behalf of elites.\nThe problems we have highlighted at the top of this post will not go away and those problems will get worse. Labour offers jam tomorrow but at a huge cost to future generations and as we have said there is too much weirdness making a prediction of what Britain might look like under a Labour government impossible to predict. It is possible that Corbyn will become the heir to Blair and we will have a return to the middle ground. But whether it is the middle ground from the Tories or Corbyn or 1970’s socialism from Corbyn, neither are the revolution Britain, the EU and the rest of the western world needs.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_we-are-troubled-by-the-hard-lefts-collusion-with-political-islam-are-you/content_317.html": "We are troubled by the hard ‘Left’s’ collusion with political Islam, Are you?\nIslam is unashamedly seventh century as a faith and political ideology. Very simply its values go back to the days of tribal agrarianism and have a doctrine of ‘no change’ dictated from God to Muhammad by the Archangel Gabriel. Individual Muslims may change but the faith upon which they depend does not. It won’t reform, it can’t reform!\nIslam is, therefore, pre ‘rights’ which only came along as a realistic expectation for some men in the 18th century with the freedom to contract, make choices and consent, requirements of the emerging capitalist system. Back then, these rights were really only available to ‘capitalists’ who were also known as ‘the bourgeois’. Most people back then didn’t count, they were ‘workers’ but in theory, they had the same rights as the capitalist.\nIslam being of the seventh century makes no reference to peoples rights but instead has control, compulsion and submission at its core. These are values totally at odds with what we have come to expect today. That is not surprising, however, ‘hand to mouth’ tribal societies that relied on brutality and ‘booty’ both human and economic, such as the one Muhammad came from would all have been exactly the same. Muhammad simply turned seventh-century economic necessity into an ideology or ‘faith’ and it’s been exported around the world ever since!\nSo why do the political “hard Left’ support Islam with its pre rights values, its control and submission ideology? It seems odd to us that within the ranks of Antifa’s and other so-called progressive ‘Leftwing’ groups’ people rail against those who, far from being ‘Islamophobic’ or racist, are simply trying to stand up for modern ‘western values’. Basically standing up for the right of all men and women to contract, make personal choices and consent as this is the legacy of our capitalist past. Upon these values, we have built freedom and democracy.\nSo the explanation. As with all dumbing down, it seems as though the ‘Left’ don’t really understand the principles of Left-wing philosophy described by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels and therefore don’t recognise that by supporting Islam and destroying ‘capitalism’ in the way they advocate, they are falling into the trap of promoting regressive ideas. They see ‘capitalism’ simply as a bad system to be overthrown wholesale rather than one where the values should be preserved and extended to working people, whilst change occurs at an institutional level.\nIslamic radicals see in the hard ‘Left’ people who like them, violently hate capitalism and also seem to hate Western values too. Maybe yes or maybe no!\nAre there ‘Left-wingers’ and Antifa’s who know what they are doing and have misogyny driving their indifference to women and girls rights when they support Islam? There may well be some but the reality for us is the modern Uk and the US ‘Left-wing’ doesn’t understand that overthrowing ‘capitalism’ should not involve overthrowing capitalism’s values but only changing capitalisms unfair ‘bourgeois’ institutions. Institutions like it’s binary Parliaments, Local Authorities, State broadcasters, and established religion plus the unrepresentative bourgeois Political Parties.\nBy being cavalier with capitalisms values the left is at risk of throwing our ‘rights’ baby out with their anti-capitalist bathwater. Should we be concerned? Well yes because more out of ignorance than intent, the ‘Left’ is ushering modern civilisation out the door whilst the seventh-century climb in via the window.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_hierarchy-and-the-link-to-alienation-and-social-injustice/content_301.html": "Hierarchy and the link to alienation and social injustice.\nIn classical Marxist theory surplus (economic) value and the role of the workers who both create it and have it “exploited” from them by capitalists, is central to how both capitalism and socialism work.\nThe process of taking surplus value from workers is akin to theft but that is not the term Marx used, he was perhaps being too polite or more likely he didn’t see capitalism as an unjust system, just unfair. Theft is unjust, exploitation unfair!\nThe worker works longer hours than he or she needs to, so as to ensure that surplus value is created and in doing so they develop an instrumental relationship to their work. They can’t enjoy it but they have to do it to live. The conclusion we draw from this process is that workers work too much and it is time rather than money that is the basis of 19th-century capitalisms unfairness. The industrial structures of the factory also reinforce the worker’s sense of powerlessness. They are not in control of the industrial processes that determine the pace of their working lives.\nThis demand for the workers surplus value and the environment within which it is created is the capitalist systems manifestation of the age-old problem of one human, generally male, and holding a superior position taking away from someone else what that someone else has worked hard to create, whilst to varying degrees controlling that person’s life. Every society since the birth of human consciousness has been discriminatory in one form or another. Underpinning this process of discrimination is control by a hierarchy, differently configured, as either tribe, feudal system or industrial hierarchy which causes the worker to feel powerless or oppressed and in the case of capitalism having external control on their work. There is in all societies a trend for control, the controls differ markedly from society to society.\nThe process of capitalist exploitation gives rise to another classic Marxist theory, the theory of “alienation”. Thus the surplus value taken by the capitalist from the worker is a kind of monetary reflection of the extent of the worker’s alienation.\nAlienation is the physical and psychological effect of a worker being exploited. In a strange ironic twist fate for the world, the solution offered by the free market to the alienated worker is the almost limitless supply of goods. The demand for goods by workers has replaced religion as the “opium of the people”. This perhaps explains the success and survival of the free market given it has a debt-dependent and a planet-destroying legacy. People accept being alienated so long as they can purchase goods and the system will produce jobs and goods as long as the debt is available to pay for them.\nNow bringing things up to date surplus value is no longer being produced by the capitalist system in sufficient quantities to be taxed by the government and thereby service the social, health, welfare and other state obligations. As a result of western capitalisms failure (it thrives elsewhere!), free market indebtedness has become the means by which the free market a remnant of the western capitalist system, is able to function and produce apparent wealth.\nWorkers exploitation and alienation have become markedly different since the mid 19th century. Today people have developed a taste for buying stuff made abroad and pay for it with debt that they have to work to pay off. All this in the false belief that spending overcomes alienation rather than reinforcing it, giving alienation in effect a social character. Arguably divorce rates reflect alienation’s social character, people only being concerned about themselves.\nThe description of capitalism based on a classical model no longer works today as it would have worked for Marx. So what has happened to exploitation, and alienation within the 21st-century free market?\nWhilst the impression given by the advocates of the modern western economy is one of promoting abundant goods and services for the consumer, the reality is that it is cheap foreign manufactured goods that mask the continued existence of alienation. In a world with little actual classical capitalist exploitation, how does exploitation still exist and are workers still alienated? We think these are good questions and we will attempt to give a fuller answer here.\nWhereas the Classical Marxist worker was not rich enough to get into debt, today the whole western economic model depends upon workers and government debt. What we have is what we at ABlueRevolution call deptamorphosis.\nThis is the process which sees the worker using their debt to promote a wealthy free-market elite. They do this working long hours often in public service organisations which are still modelled on 19th-century industrial hierarchies. Many earn money paid from government debt, to service their personal debt-dependent lifestyle. This is as alienating for the worker today as it was in the 19th century as they have no influence over their working practices (KPI’s today), nor the ability to escape the treadmill of debt. Just like in Marx’s day the worker has “freedom” to leave the workplace but has little likelihood of using it.\nThus whilst the working environment is a safer environment than in Marx’s day it is no less alienating. Today the worker may be doing work that has little or no economic value, and more controversially little social value either. A state employment system based on hierarchical industrial models and which pays its workers to blame the unemployed because their jobs have gone to China or a health service maintaining a low level of wellness in a system all paid for with debt is alienating for all. This is not an economy free of alienation. Workers don’t feel linked to the people they serve as customers or patients, they are forced to feel a closer link to the system which controls them and pays them. No difference here to the hierarchy of the industrial era and there are huge differentials in pay.\nLikewise expecting the worker to become indebted to make “free marketeers” and public servants rich is a new way of exploiting workers that Karl Marx could not have identified if he had lived into the mid 20th century.\nPerhaps the solution is to look at where in any modern organisation the social value is created and liberate workers at that level casting out of the organisations the people who have high wages paid to them but they offer little in the way of social value.\nIf Capitalism had been forced to yield to the dictatorship of the workers, as opposed to evolving into the debt-dependent planet-destroying monster the free market has become, then it is the capitalist and their exploiting hierarchy that would have been put asunder, not the work or the workers themselves. There are lessons here for operational public servants in all departments of the state and the army of 100k+ a year bosses who manage them.",

The problem with Grenfell is that the actual residents were somewhere down the pecking order when decisions were being made about their block. The experts made decisions that have resulted in a bleak but safe 197o’s tower block being turned into a slightly less bleak death trap. Now is not the time for emotion. But emotion seems to be the order of the day served up by an emotionally promiscuous media.\nThe Judge who has been identified to head up the Public Enquiry is described as too remote from the victims to be fair and impartial. What the victims want is someone who can emote about the tragedy. Senior Judges leap to the Judge’s defence. The problem here is that the demand for an emotional reaction is as problematic in 21st century Britain as posh Judges being seen as remote because they are posh. With the establishment and their 18th-century institutions unable to adapt so that ordinary people can prosper among them, one-half of the regrettable binary which seems to unite the muddle-headed supporters of the left is emotion. Emotion versus rationality. The ’emotional’ is the key to Corbyn’s success and it explains not only the Tories failure but also how Corbyn can unite Mumsnet, students, hard middle and soft left, public sector workers and luvvies.\nThe emotional and rationality binary is just another dispiriting binary in modern 21ct century Britain. A binary that includes political left and right as well as Leave and Remain on Brexit, Islamophobia and the observant Muslims fear of secular western culture and it’s corrosive values particularly on issues such as family life and debt based economics. Until we tackle our binary culture and the institutions which support it including the party system, Parliament and Courts we will see emotion moving centre stage and Corbyn’s left with it. Our enlightenment values which triggered our Capitalism and industrialisation and modern cultural identity are in retreat and with them, our rights and freedoms will start to disappear too.

The same applies to Macron.\nIn a statement, Macron claims to be able to “tackle the failed political system” and then comes up with Blairite ‘third way’ policies that will essentially liberalise the labour and financial markets that enable businesses and banks to sell debt and drive consumption to levels that will only be sustained and profitable in the medium term if work is off-shored or undertaken by migrant labour. It will be a consumption revolution but will not become a blue collar revolution, it will simply be another triumph of the state and the states mates, over the individual. The most vulnerable will suffer and then like Blair, Marcon will take to the international ‘hot air circuit’ and bullshit on behalf of the Bilderberg group. What Macron and Trump don’t get is that ‘revolution’ is not about policy but about how the state designs and delivers policy and for both men, the mechanics of the state remain unchanged. Therefore the people will continue to be ‘done to’ rather than being active participants in Blue Revolutionary change.\nSo what is going to happen in France and should the UK worry. Basically, in our view, there is no change across the channel. The French “Reds” will riot and start fires etc. The whole package of policies will disintegrate under the sheer weight of internal opposition and this will all be happening as Britain is telling the EU that unless we get a good deal from Brexit we will become an offshore tax haven to the collapsing French economy.\nMarcon and Trump both elites and with an elite’s vested interests cannot deliver the new democracy and a new post-war, and in the case of Marcon post-EU settlement. They both need to look at the system, but they won’t because the system is why they are where they are!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_a-fresh-look-at-meritocracy-maybe-we-have-all-got-it-wrong/content_48.html": "A fresh look at meritocracy. Maybe we have all got it wrong.\nThe Marxian notion that economic resources should be allocated “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” (1) has always caused confusion. Such a method of allocating resources is not typically associated with merit because of the prevailing twentieth-century view that Marxism is state social engineering, so merit cannot play a part.\nHistorically society has created meritocracies on the back of economic systems which exploit the labour-power of others, legitimising it with religious, legal and political structures which collectively define the parameters of consciousness.\nToday we are governed by politicians who have run out of ways to improve society without the use of debt to maintain the political status quo and to prop up levels of consumption to maintain GDP. This badly distorts what we have come to accept as meritocracy however worthily it is viewed, our consciousness was and still is defined in terms of exploitation.\nHaving debt as a substitute for economic value with its burden falling to workers of future generations, whilst maintaining outmoded politics and supporting a global financial elite, suggests that we need to look at how we can create a more just system which better reflects a modern conception of merit.\nAllocating resources based on ability and needs without state engineering requires us to look anew at the concept of merit and meritocracy. In doing so we must place it in a free market twenty-first-century economic context with opportunity and choice as central aims. “From each” “to each” within Marx’s definition suggests opportunity and choice is integral to the economic and political ‘settlement’. Rather than state engineering based on mere conscience that the system is ‘unjust’, modern collective consciousness may act as a worthy substitute for state interference.\nIn the twenty-first century “From each according to his ability to each according to his needs”, must be expressed both economically and politically but reflect Marx’s vision of society with a modern collective consciousness that rejects the exploitation of others at every political and social level. Merit is not about status and wealth, both of which remain the benchmarks for measuring the success of a meritocratic system.\nMarx’s vision of workers controlling capitalist production has little modern relevance. However, the principles that underpin capitalism and are enshrined within Marx’s analysis of capitalism can be used to formulate a new concept of merit that promotes opportunities for ordinary people within a free market society.\nCapitalism was, in its earliest iterations, meritocratic but economically unfair relying on the appropriation of workers labour-power to create capital. It reflected principles of contract, choice and consent as the basis for delivering economic and political freedom, only open to the elite.\nSocialism extended the principles of contract, choice and consent to all adults. We have become accustomed to the freedom this offers us. The state has probably moved as far as it can go in extending these principles socially and economically allowing same-sex couples to contract in marriage for example.\nHowever, locked into their own eighteenth-century political bunker, parliament is unwilling to extend real political choice and consent to working people. “Meritocracy” remains defined by eighteenth-century ideals. Our political system is sadly a mausoleum to eighteenth-century capitalisms economic unfairness and therefore it is unable to address the economic inequality and unfairness it seeks to change. Its definition of meritocracy remains wealth and status based and is therefore inherently unfair and unequal.\nMeritocracy must not be one based on an economic model that enshrines merit in terms of wealth-based status. We must define merit in terms of how well people deliver positive economic, social and political outcomes for themselves and others within a free market, based on contract, choice and consent. This must be done legitimately with mass support and without burdening the people of the nation with unrealistic financial expectations based on the economic principles and ‘successes’ of the past.\nThe meritocracy of the future should allow the ordinary person to achieve economic and political parity with those people who enjoy power and status today. Of course, given the role of debt, it does not mean ordinary people going up some national debt-based wealth or status ladder. It means those currently on the top of the existing ladder coming down. The economic framework, the free market, is already in place, what it lacks is a legitimate political expression. Meritocracy must now be about politically empowering ordinary people.\nReform of the political system must reflect the new economic reality of the free market. The power to reduce the cost and burden of the state on the ordinary worker and thus promote enterprise will never come from a state which refuses to move beyond a political environment set up in the eighteenth century to represent the interests of extinct economic and political elites. In much the same way as the left has lost its industrial working class the right has lost its British economic elite.\nAchieving change must involve empowering elected representatives at every administrative level from parish council up. Making them functioning members of the legislature. Politics will become significantly more meritocratic and less party dominated. It will be possible for specialists, as councillors, to address parliament on areas of expertise i.e. farming or teaching.\nIt will mean that the costs of the state will be exposed to the scrutiny of ordinary workers and are more likely to come down than go up. Routes into politics will deliver more access to ordinary people thus empowering them. This will be meritocratic in two ways. It allows successful politicians a career ladder that requires paid employment in lower tiers. By reducing the cost of the state, taxes will be lower stimulating the economy. It will reduce feelings of “them and us” creating perceptions that fair resources are distributed based on abilities and needs. Politics needs to align with the meritocracy of the free market our twenty-first economic reality.\n- Karl Marx Critique of the Gotha Programme. Progress Publishing. eighth edition 1988 p18",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_marx-or-lenin-socialism-democracy-and-the-state/content_228.html": "Marx or Lenin? Socialism, Democracy and the State.\nMarx or Lenin. Socialism, Democracy and the State.\nMarxism has evolved, not only because of a fashion for different interpretations but because of changing material realities, making large parts irrelevant or requiring radical reinterpretation. Marx was writing in the early to mid-nineteenth century a world quite different from the western world of today.\nWithin that nineteenth-century world, Marx saw growing economic and social injustice and whilst at times his analysis could be obscure or overly complicated the general theme of all his work is to promote four fundamental revolutionary ideas, the easiest to understand are the liberation of the working class from ‘exploitation’ by capitalists, equalising the distribution of wealth and time, and the withering away of the state. The fourth the collective ownership of the means of production is far more complicated but is relevant to how the ‘socialist’ experiments in Russia and China were framed. I will deal with this fourth Marxist aim separately when examining Lenin’s legacy of authoritarianism. I will conclude by describing what the first three of Marx and Engels aims might look like today as capitalism goes into, yet another crisis and this time the working people must be empowered to help save the free market and by extending democracy bring about the socialism of Marx as opposed to the authoritarian socialism of Lenin.\nWho was Marx?\nKarl Marx was a German polymath, revolutionary, philosopher, economist, and linguist. He was middle class, which meant he understood the values of other middle-class people whom he later termed the bourgeoisie. Marx’s family would have been petty or small bourgeoisie as they were not directly involved in the ‘exploitation’ of the working class. His father was a lawyer. The petty bourgeoisie, however, adopts the attitudes, values and vanities of the ‘big’ bourgeoisie who were the industrialists, banking families and business people who grew rich on the back of employing and exploiting workers.\nMarx having married young and abandoned legal studies for journalism would have become very aware of how exposed and precarious the life of the worker was. Having left legal studies, he became little more than an itinerant worker himself. He and his wife eventually had six children and no regular income so the reality of life with economic uncertainty, no healthcare or welfare would have defined his and his families ‘lived reality’. He was poor and dependent on the kindness of his friend and collaborator Fredrich Engels.\nWhat did Marx think?\nMarx and his friend Fredrich Engels believed that there were many types of ‘socialism’. You can read about these in the Manifesto of the Communist Party 1848. They dismissed these ‘socialisms’ as either idealist, utopian or romantic. The idea that socialism was about being kind, generous with other people’s money or harking back to an earlier pre-industrial age struck them as too simplistic. Marx and Engels wanted socialism to have some rigorous and broad ideological thinking behind it. And that it had to build on the legacy of capitalism, rather than merely destroy capitalism they thought was essential. Socialism was a progression from capitalism. They called their socialism ‘scientific’ socialism. Scientific meaning rigorously argued and properly evidenced. They studied human evolution from a social as opposed to biological perspective and argued that humanity was on a path towards ‘communism’, a return to cooperation and collaboration by all peoples the world over based on either the absence or curtailment of top-down political power. Marxist socialism was the last stop before ‘communism’ was achieved. It is worth noting here that ‘communism’ is never described by either Marx or Engels. How could it be, it was created by the collective interests and power of the working class, not by nineteenth-century socialist thinkers and intellectuals.\nWhat is Marxist socialism?\nScientific socialism begins by looking at the evolution of economies and how these economies fall into ‘types’ and how they then shape people’s lives and political realities. So, fifty thousand years ago humanity was tribal across the surface of the planet. Food was scarce and individual lives would be brutal and short. However, argued Marx and Engels there would be general equality with the only differentiation being based on sex. Even between the sexes, there would be little in the way of power differences as males needed females and females needed males. Both required each other to survive the reality of their harsh lives. This brutal but largely egalitarian way of life slowly changed, beginning in the Middle East around ten thousand years ago. Things changed because humanity invented ways to produce more food than was needed. Thus, populations grew and what should have been a time of plenty for all, became the beginning of the period that according to Marx gave rise to the modern age of greed and selfishness, known to classical Marxists as the ages of exploitation.\nBecause there was more food, strong powerful men could control access to it. They could create wealth by feeding people and getting them to work as slaves to do things other than hunt or scavenge, for example, mine gold, make artefacts and build monuments. Wealth was born and with it the ability of some people to have more than others. And with a small class having more than the majority, ideas would be created, called myths, to justify the situation. These myths later became religions or became ideas within religion.\nMoving on from the ancient world and over time the way wealth is created and who owned it has changed. But at the centre of the process is still greed, selfishness, and exploitation. These in turn give rise to inequality, unfairness, and elitism.\nWho was Lenin?\nLenin enters the story in the late nineteenth century. He was a Russian lawyer who came from a petty-bourgeois family too. His early life was influenced by the fact that Russia was still a country governed by a King, the Czar who had absolute power. In the nineteenth century, Europe was emerging into a continent dominated by capitalism and so had minimised or abolished altogether the power of their monarchs.\nWhat is capitalism?\nCapitalism was not a system of relationships based on inherited power and status like monarchies, it was a legal framework within which contract, choice and consent were the only principles that governed the economy. Within society, there may have been other rules and prohibitions, such as a ban on poor people having the vote or discrimination against certain religions, but the capitalist economic system was indifferent to that. Anyone could become wealthy if they played within the rules of contract, choice, and consent and in doing so found a way to exploit workers to make a profit. It was thus possible for the Jewish community to be active economically, something they could not be in politics, due to centuries of discrimination.\nWith such a minimal framework governing the economic exploitation of workers became grotesque and poverty, starvation, illiteracy, and poor health blighted the lives of workers across Europe.\nWhat did Lenin think?\nIn Russia Lenin and his brother, Alexi had been battling feudalism, capitalism was barely relevant to the majority of Russian’s. What the revolutionaries in Russia wanted was the end of the monarchy. Alexander, Lenin’s brother was executed for trying to kill the czar. What they sought was the kind of revolution that Britain had gone through in the seventeenth century when we killed our King Charles I, and France had gone through in the eighteenth century when they killed their king Louis XIV. Russia was late to the game of destroying feudalism and whilst in Britain and France capitalism was then introduced, this was not something that Lenin and the Bolshevik’s wanted. And this is the basic problem for modern socialism and modern socialists.\nThe principles of modern socialism are not Marxist principles. Their ideas are not based on evolving from capitalism to socialism and then beyond that, to freeing people from top-down political control thus promoting the withering away the state itself. Their ideas are about the state exercising power and control in the name of the people and destroying capitalism and everything capitalism stood for both good and bad.\nAs Marx argued in Britain and much of Europe capitalism had already destroyed feudalism, but Lenin wanted to use an almost feudal like power, state socialism, to destroy Russian feudalism and to prevent capitalism getting established in Russia. They succeeded in destroying Russian feudalism in the twentieth century when they killed the Czar Nicholas Romanov and his whole family in July 1918.\nBecause of Lenin and the Russian revolution, modern socialism is not based on the idea of revolutionary change taking place within a failing capitalist system, a failing capitalist system which leaves a legacy of freedom based on contract, choice, and consent, but on what you need to do to destroy feudalism and then prevent capitalism happening.\nWhat was Lenin’s legacy?\nBritain and France had done what Marx had predicted. The capitalists had destroyed feudalism and imposed capitalism, creating modern legal principles of contract, choice and consent but had been guilty of exploiting workers in the process. Russian socialists had, in the twentieth century, destroyed feudalism. This was because Lenin saw capitalism as so awful with no redeeming characteristics, they were not going to let it get established in post-feudal Russia. So throughout most of the twentieth century, the Russian economy was not based on contract, choice, and consent, but as it always had been, on the power of the state to tell people what to do and how to do it. That was that model for Russian industrialisation. Not a free market based on contract, choice, and consent but on a centralised bureaucracy controlled by a one-party state.\nThis model of the state telling people what to do and how to do it, created by Lenin to avoid capitalism getting properly established in Russia is what modern socialism is all about. It was justified, not on the grounds of overt authoritarianism, of course not, but for the ‘collective good’. This was a misinterpretation by Lenin of Marx and Engels view that the means of production should be ‘collectively’ owned by the working class. The state was not of course ‘the working class’ it remained and remains implacably ‘the state’. But in Russia control of the economy and the means of production was described as ‘collectivist’ by the state and it was the way the Bolsheviks controlled society. The Russian state was an authority remote from the very people who were of course the real workers.\nThanks to Lenin’s revolutionary legacy authoritarianism too often defines the attitude of all those who call themselves socialist from The UK Labour Party’s Momentum, to Antifa, the ‘woke’, the no platformers’ to the trans radicals and Black Lives Matter. All believe they have the right to tell people what to do or what to think without any need to consider people have, in the western world, acquired from capitalism basic rights based on contract, choice, and consent. Rights like free speech, free association, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. Contract, Choice, and consent are without doubt capitalism’s most valuable contribution to humanities long and conflicted journey back to an unenforced and self-imposed near equality.\nWhat might the socialism of Marx and Engels look like today?\nWithin a socialist society that comes after capitalism, and which is based on Classical Marxism as opposed to Leninism we can ask what would the liberation of the working class from ‘exploitation’ by capitalists, equalising the distribution of wealth and time, and the withering away of the state look like?\nWe have all but achieved the former with the exception that big corporations’ ‘offshore’ profits to avoid tax. Big global corporations (and despots and dictators) are the only bodies currently exploiting the worlds working class by not paying profits via taxation into our welfare, health care and education systems. This is a global scandal and needs multi-national agreement perhaps via the United Nations or World Trade Organisation to correct this. The second issue relates to wealth and time. This can be easily addressed by giving working people more scope to develop talent by making education or training free at any point in life and by limiting the wages through taxation of ‘talent’ who come to dominate or monopolise the mainstream media TV and radio channels. Doing things that you enjoy like acting should not cast some into poverty and others onto the Hollywood ‘A’ list. Soccer has the same problem. It all just looks so stupidly unfair.\nFinally, the withering away of the state. Marx and Engels say this as a progressive process, not a cliff edge revolution. It begins by allowing ordinary workers to both speak to and stand up for themselves within a democracy that places political influence right down at the lowest political level. Scrapping the House of Lords and creating a new ‘peoples’ lower chamber comprised of the democratically elected councillors who are elected at no cost to themselves, to local government, could be the beginning. They would scrutinise national government policy based on their real worker’s experience and bring the expertise of teachers and small businessmen and businesswomen and health care workers to the national debate. It would be an easy way to get the ball rolling.\nSo, in conclusion, when most people think of Marx they are thinking about the reality of Lenin’s Russia or Mao’s China not the scientific socialism of Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels who between them created the people’s, not the state’s socialism.",

A difference in values between the ‘ideology’ of Islam and ‘western values’. How can you help?\n3rd June 2018\nThe Rt Hon James Brokenshire\nSecretary of State for Housing\nCommunities and Local Government\n2 Marsham Street London SW1P 4DF\nDear Secretary of State\nOne issue which is causing ordinary people great concern and is clearly not being addressed within communities is associated with the high numbers of people of the Muslim faith living in concentrated areas of inner cities. There are many challenges arising from this development some of which may be reflected in attitudes towards other faiths. There, therefore, appears to be little integration as the “British way of life” is seemingly Haram to many observant Muslims.\nHaving reviewed what may be behind the creation of a form of separate development, it seems to us that there have been a number of reports which have been significant in the past and continue to exert influence over the behaviour of Public Sector organisations and we believe this impedes the development of a shared set of twenty-first century values.\nThe Parekh Report published by the Runnymede Trust in 2000, the Mc Pherson Report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the Runnymede Trust consultation into “Islamophobia” have in our view all resulted in unintended consequences that are impacting on communities now.\nTaking each, in turn, the Parekh report was comprehensive, well researched and influential. It fixed the policy expectations that were considered necessary to deliver a safe harmonious multicultural Britain in the new Millenium. It was culturally Marxist in its emphasis on prejudice, discrimination exclusion and inequality, as opposed to being class-based. However, the upshot of such top-down engineering is that it presupposes that the solution to important issues can be delivered by government and public sector policy.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that the report did make the following percipient comment “The need for both equality and difference and to respect the rights of both individuals and communities appears to be beyond the compass of existing political vocabularies. The debate about British multiculturalism needs to pursue these long-term questions. It has hardly begun”\nWe would argue it has never started. This inability to meet the demands of equality and difference has established we believe a culture of organisational paranoia about the negative role in which organisations see themselves having unintentionally reinforced prejudice. As a result in places like Rochdale organisational fear and the absence of the ‘shared core values and human rights culture’ advocated by Parekh led the abuse of vulnerable white girls. This unintended consequence is now leading to anger being directed at the State by ordinary working people and their anger is both justified and understandable. If a report promotes a set of policy suggestions of a legal and procedural nature with vague suggestions about “values” that are not adopted by all communities and children are harmed, people will be moved to anger.\nIn respect of the Runnymede Trust Commission on Islamophobia in 1997, it identified a ‘mad’ view of Islam by westerners and came up with eight ways that groups with opposing views could overcome prejudice. For example, seeing groups as different but having equal worth, as opposed to seeing groups as violent etc.\nThe problem with this method is that it has been adopted by liberal western groups and yet the failure to adopt this method of mutual understanding by grassroots Muslims has resulted in a failure of dialogue at street level. It is sadly a commonly held view that Western culture is haram! The effect is that there has been a general retreat from dialogue at community level unless publicly funded schools are taking non-Muslim children to mosques. There is, therefore, a general reinforcement of separate development. This phenomenon has not assisted the aftermath of Rochdale. Communities simply do not widely share the same values and clearly have no desire so to do. The Islamic faith contains many values at odds with many of those of the twenty-first century West with little mutual respect particularly in respect of the treatment of women and girls.\nFinally, the report into the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence identified institutional racism within the police. The allegation of police racism continues to cause problems in communities today. If prejudice, discrimination, exclusion and inequality are identified with public bodies as suggested by Parekh then those bodies like Police and Local Authorities will fail to serve their communities. They will and do operate to politically safeguard themselves from the possibility of charges of racism by the government or overt Political Correctness from the press.\nCurrently, knife crime and gang violence are establishing primitive values that are totally at odds with values compatible with the twenty-first century and little is being done to address it. Is there a “Queen’s Peace” in our inner cities?\nIf it is as stated that these issues remain beyond current ‘political vocabularies’ then it is urgent that action is taken. We would urge Her Majesty’s Government to consider a wide-ranging commission and consultation at all levels of society exploring the issue of community integration. There must be no hiding from harsh realities like faith justified abuse that has become established in some communities nor the social failure in white working-class communities that has created many of the victims. We need to have an open and transparent debate before the differentiation of communities, the lack of shared values; (the ambition of Parekh) starts to cause a generalised breakdown of moral cohesion.\nYours sincerely\nTG\nOn behalf Blue Revolution",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_introduction-christianity-and-islam-a-marxist-analysis/content_281.html": "Introduction – Christianity and Islam – a Marxist Analysis\nIntroduction – Christianity and Islam – a Marxist Analysis\nThe Blue Revolution is a political platform which aims to bring an end to the party political system by enabling as many like-minded people as possible from as wide a variety of backgrounds to stand for elections at every administrative level from Parish to Parliament. This is achieved by the simple means of authorising the use of the platforms emblems to those who endorse the Blue Revolution “core values” and five manifesto pledges.\nAs part of this process, a series of publications have been produced on important issue s which underpin our political attitudes and can be found on our Website www.ABlueRevolution.Org as well as in booklet form available from the address above.\nThis latest discussion paper has been produced because of the turmoil surrounding particularly in the Western world the effect of the two main religions and secularization .has on political thinking.\nWith increasing global interrelationships the issues of religious discord have become more strident and confused in the lives of people. Add to this mix political uncertainty and political response becomes more extreme and less than helpful to voters. Party politics seem irrelevant and voters become disillusioned.\nThis paper is part of an overall contribution attempting to come at the situation from a new perspective whilst drawing on past concepts.\nChristianity and Islam – a Marxist Analysis\nMarxism rejects the spiritual and adopts a materialist interpretation of history. Materialism is the study of economic and social reality not just the world of ideas. According to Classical Marxists the history of religion is simply the history of ideas that work in the economic interests of the powerful, but with the powerful claiming these ideas are sanctified by God. This sleight of hand, using God to justify material inequality, was a common feature of ideologies in the age of antiquity and is described by Plato as a ‘golden lie’ in his work known as ‘The Republic’.\nTherefore, social progress according to Marxists does not happen because a God intervenes in human affairs. Marxists believe in progress arising from various active economic and scientific forces creating real-world conflicts which by getting resolved in the real-world, change society. This active process is called dialectics. Marxism is therefore based on dialectical materialism, the history of humanities social progress in terms of the conflict and resolution of various economic and scientific realities.\nFurthermore, Marx argued that religion reflects various stages in the evolution of human consciousness as it is shaped by economic and scientific reality. Basically, the easier people find it to accept inequality and discrimination as ‘God’ given, the less evolved a person’s consciousness could be claimed to be. A troubling thought for everyone from the Salafists of Saudi Arabia to the Bourgeoisie of North America and Europe.\nIn the world of Classical Marxism, we have only two big world perspectives, the abstract ideas of religions and their Gods and the idea of Materialism. For Classical Marxists, it is all about economic, scientific and social facts, not faith.\nTo many ordinary western working people, Christianity and Islam have lost their relevance as neither reflects the material or spiritual needs of twenty-first-century humanity, both being stuck in a world of past inequality sanctified by ‘God’\nAs a result of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century revolutionary movements that created capitalism and which arose because protestant Christian doctrine was shaped by demands for greater social and economic mobility, the west created a society that eventually developed personal freedom and principles of legally enforced consent-based choice and contract, for all adults. Essentially freedom, but for most ordinary working people it amounted to little more than the freedom to starve! For capitalism to get established people had eventually to have this radical change forced on them. They did so because Protestantism needed to measure righteousness and virtue on earth and could not if religion were in favour of the poor in heaven as feudalism had been.\nRoll forward three hundred years and the issue for the west is that this legal and economic consent-based framework now gives rise to an unbridled free for all, the ‘free market’ This leaves many impoverished whilst others, amass fortunes and the whole system has more than just a whiff of the immoral about it.\nWithout some widely understood and accepted rules of fair play this economic model has begun to consume society with what is seen by many as planet destroying greedy self-interest. A mass grab for consumables with little self-regulation. This has come about because the slow decline of Christianity, most marked in Western Europe, has eroded the application of Protestant Christian social values of hard work, sobriety, and thrift. At its simplest, Christianity based on ‘love thy neighbour’ eventually put some limits on the harsh economic indifference of the capitalist economy with workhouses, charities and prison reform. This was before Governments, yielding to outraged public opinion, became the nation’s moral arbiters, upholding choice-based consent, in a secular and therefore ‘rights’ based moral framework. Islamic sharia being a ‘political ideology’ offers humanity an alternative moral solution to both secularism’s rights and Christian morality.\nChristianity having helped to create a dynamic social and economic society has now lost its role in shaping or constraining it, leaving it to a combination of personal self-interest constrained only by costly state intervention. This free-for-all offends people of faiths as well as those who believe in secular self-restraint imposed by the state. In the world of religion, Islam offers an alternative to all that the now secular once Christian west has created. Indeed, a non-violent form of ‘political Islam’ which extols the virtues of sharia and obedience to Allah within a peaceful Islam offers what seems to be considered by some Muslim scholars a path between Capitalism and Marxism. The writer George Bernard Shaw is often wrongly quoted as supporting this view. However because sharia is an ideology which pre dates capitalism and is based on submission to the revealed word of God and the human example set by Muhammed an example of man to be impersonated by others it lacks the consent based choice that is fundamental to any proper ‘Marxist’ revolution.\nSo, within the world of Christian and Islamic faith we have two views, self-restraint within Christianity, now largely ignored and a more rigid application of rules within Islam based on the Qur’an and Hadith. How can we understand this conflict in Marxist terms and therefore help to address it using a shared understanding of God to heal the difference between these two religions and assist both to an understanding of the secular community who feel threatened or baffled by religion?\nTo sort out the second part of this analysis therefore we need to ask some questions of religion. For example, how did Christianity create a dynamic social and economic model in the mid to late period of the last millennium, and why was Islam able to do the same prior to that, and then stop in or around the sixteenth century. And could Islam re discover its dynamic potential today?\nChristianity’s first revolution was presenting in the first century a triune God. A God of three persons, father, son and holy spirit. Within Classical Marxism, it is possible to understand the significance of the Trinity in a way that explains its importance economically. Marx used the principles of dialectics to explain social evolution. The terms Marx used were thesis, antithesis and synthesis. So applying these terms to Christianity’s triune God, the Father is the originator of material and social reality, the creator, the Son becomes the opposite of this harsh world of brutality, exploitation, conquest and occupation, namely the ‘love’ of God, made man, Jesus, and the spirit is the process that combines them as they become collective Christian consciousness. This mirrors Marxist working-class consciousness. An awareness of the adverse consequences of earthly status, unfairness and inequality. Rich men and needles so to speak.\nIn Marxist theory thesis, antithesis and synthesis were used in the nineteenth century for an analysis of the politics of revolution. From the time of Christ onwards, the process of human material realities being established and then challenged, thus creating new economic and social systems eventually created the capitalist system. Capitalism based on extending basic legal principles of consent and choice within a free economy and to an expanding middle class, was, perhaps because of its somewhat anarchic nature, described by Adam Smith in the eighteenth century as being governed by an invisible hand. An abstracted concept used to describe the movement of resources in pursuit of economic goals, giving rise to both economic and social outcomes. Over-time by extending consent and choice to working men, women and minorities, Christian morality was undermined by secular rights.\nIslam in the seventh century never accepted the trinity, adopting an implacable form of monotheism which is described as the doctrine of Tawhid which in its own way is as revolutionary as the Trinity was six hundred years earlier.\nTawhid holds that God is a singularity without characteristic, definition or form. God is abstracted to the point of being almost unknowable, except as revealed via the activity of humanity summed up in the Arabic term inshallah or God willing. This too is a revolutionary idea. Because of this unknowability and the revelation of God through human behaviour both good and bad, Islam has the potential to once again become a force for economic and social progress as it was in the fourteenth century. With Tawhid it is possible to see God as more akin to Adam Smith’s and the western world’s invisible hand, than a God who differentiates people and sanctions war, revenge, conquest, conversion and submission. These are human characteristics, which humanity has ascribed to God claiming they have Gods sanctification. It enables human actions to be classed as legitimate or profane all especially useful for imperfect humanity and for those who wish to use God to promote sectarian interests.\nHowever, unlike the doctrine of Tawhid, God in much of the Islamic world is not abstracted. The God of Islam is, thanks to human intervention not without definition, character or form. This is the result of Gods singularity being revealed not through the transcendence of freely expressed collective human activity, directed by an “invisible hand” but through a revelation, delivered to Muhammed via the Angel Gabriel. The legacy of linking God to the moral requirements of one place at one time serves only to define God and therefore give Islamic justice as seventh-century man-made appearance. A morality of dress and hygiene practices and different roles and rights for women and men based on the limited understanding of seventh-century biology. It may also explain why for much of Islam’s history since the eighteen century the faithful were called Mohammedans. Followers of Mohammed and less obviously worshippers of a singular transcendent God.\nSo, in the twenty-first century, we have two powerful religions which are doctrinally at odds with each other and which both buffer against the west’s drive for a ‘secular’ world. A world without God. Christianity has given us the economic anarchy of the seventeenth to twenty-first century west and created the ‘invisible hand of capitalist free enterprise’ but has now left a moral vacuum, occupied by the secular state. Islam reflecting the unique and attractive idea of the singularity of God, a God revealing transcendence in a way like the western world’s invisible hand, has linked God to the moral and economic rites and realities of the seventh century Arab Peninsular.\nThe world has, therefore, two significant religions, neither able to progress humanity harmoniously, beset by opposing ideas of human freedom and set as they are in a secular western world of unlimited choice. Christianity had provided productive economic anarchy but today has declining moral influence. Islam has the capacity to once again be as revolutionary as Christianity once was because of Tawhid. However, by its doctrinal tie to the man-made seventh century, can do little more than encourage a return to past and now outdated certainties and religious dogma based on pre-enlightenment ideas of compulsion and coercion.\nSo, what is to be done? Maybe just accepting that for all faiths and no faith, human reality and science are Gods true revelation and they are compatible with both the doctrine of Tawhid and the western protestant and enlightenment notion of the invisible hand. The revelation of the God who is unknowable, with no definition or form revealed through the collective activity of humanity. So in conclusion within this understanding of God, both failure and success are of neutral importance as are good and evil all are God-ordained and reflect Gods love of human endeavour as we progress towards a greater understanding of Gods transcendence through the application of science and our material reality. If all faiths could accept this, it might help Christianity, Islam and secularism come to a common understanding of what God is, and moreover what God is not.\nMike Gilbert author Jane Robson proof-reader April 28th 2020",

No of course he isn’t he is part of a socialist elite who like Lenin want to use the bourgeois state to repress the workers. Read on.\nJohn McDonnell was asked this question and seems to have had difficulty answering it. Leading to the obvious conclusion that of course, he is a Marxist….shock horror to all right-thinking people. He probably sees himself as a Marxist, a man with a scientific insight into the fundamentals of the misfiring capitalist economy. Except for err…he really isn’t.\nJohn and the assorted collection of shhhhhhhh “Marxists” in the ranks of the Labour party are not Marxists at all. They are socialists and not only that their confused “messaging” reveals that they are not really democratic “socialists” but nasty trolling socialists who would like to use the bourgeois state to take control of the economy and that includes its workers and of course silence dissent. Real Modern Marxists would accept as Marx would have, the bourgeois values of freedom of speech, of conscience, of lifestyle, of contract, choice and consent but reject the bourgeois state which crystalised exploitation and the exclusion of workers from decisions about the economy.\nWhen has the state really represented the workers and promoted worker involvement? Whether it is the 1970’s and the state on behalf of the workers was “running” industries like rail or coal mining or the 1920’s with Lenin’s Russian state “running” industries on behalf of workers, workers never feel particularly empowered.\nSo our “Marxists” as they unashamedly promote, simply want to run the economy under public ownership as though they owned it. This is the tried and tested model of failure we have seen for nearly a century. Our “Marxists” are simply public ownership socialists who tax and spend using debt. Not fully grown up Marxists. Our observations, however, beg a very important question, If McDonnell et al are not Marxists, who is?\nWell, we are nearer to it than any socialist can ever be. We believe in redistribution of wealth but unlike “Marxist” McDonnell we don’t count debt or it’s derivatives in the form of free market profitability as wealth. We don’t see the state as being anything other than a burden on workers who have to pay tax to pay for inefficient waste and an army of bureaucrats meddling in the economy. We believe in worker involvement in the economy and society via a wide legislative structure and not the 18th-century party system.

It could all be due to a little known ‘Marxist’ called Gramasci.\nWhy have our long fought for legitimate 18th-century values (bourgeois values!) of free speech and free expression come under attack from our 18th-century bourgeois institutions of Parliament, Church of England, and Local authorities?\nIn 1997 a revolution began, based on the writings of a little known early 20th century Italian ‘Marxist’ called Antonio Gramsci. Gramsci departed from orthodox Marxism outrageously, because he believed the bureaucracy of the State should be used to manipulate the working class rather than the working class rise up and dominate the State.\nThis Gramscian revolution has systematically undermined values for working people all over Europe ever since it’s advocates entered power. In the Uk, the “revolution” was initially spearheaded following the election of Tony Blair who arrived with a wide-ranging agenda to deliver modernisation for a Britain he saw as old-fashioned, prejudiced and backwards looking.\nWe didn’t need him to do anything, of course, we were well on the way to modernising our culture without him. We accepted Tom Robinson in the 1970’s, Bronski Beat in the 1980’s and we have accepted all sorts of “lifestyle choices” since the end of World War Two. Even so, many of us had to endure workshop after workshop in workplaces, schools and universities from 1997 onwards to correct our faulty thinking.\nThis was an all-encompassing interference from our state institutions. This secular theology was hell-bent on instilling perverse oppressive values in an open-minded and tolerant society. Hate Crime or as we call it Thought Crime, became a mainstay of this needless “revolution”. It effectively undermined free-thinking working people for whom it was not in the interests of the Blair/EU neo-liberal elite to have a thinking working class. The elite desired an “engineered compliance” or alternatively an “indoctrinated subservience” among its working people.\nThe Blair EU agenda had a multicoloured rainbow of “identity groups” all seemingly in need of the power of the benign state bureaucracy to protect their unique vulnerabilities from an ill-defined “mob” of hate-filled homophobes, racists and Islamophobes. Thus the “proletariat” under this system was “differentiated” Into the Gay community, racial minorities, industrial and public sector workers, and people of minority faiths like Islam. Marx would have spun in his grave. This would have been seen by he and Engels as the Bureaucratic state manipulating the values of the people and preventing the emergence of a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\nThe whole enterprise required “intellectuals” to maintain the purity of this progressive agenda. Maybe student loans were introduced to get the youth into Universities where the institutions would act as instruments of Blair’s programme of indoctrination. Blairs incantation of “Education, Education, Education” claim spells it out quite clearly. The “snowflakes” are certainly in the mould of Blairs agenda.\nHowever, the problem for Blair, Cameron and May is that this agenda assumed the success of other branches of the Neo-Con project such as democracy flourishing in the Middle East. What happened as we know is this, shorn of their feudal systems the migrants from the destroyed economies or Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Libya along with the more established Pakistan and Bangladeshi communities became outspoken about the failings of our values and yet could arrogantly promote their own values and the destruction of ours, whilst we are forced to remain silent with Hate Crime the alternative to our free speech.\nThose groups who oppose British values have no tradition of free speech or women’s equality and so have no interest in the Blair revolution except that it provides an opportunity to undermine British values whilst promoting their own. Our values we have fought to get for 200 years and to secure them for all working people, now they are under threat from our political elite. It’s all so 14th century.\n.",

What we love is destroying us and the planet. We no longer love each other we can only see each other as “opportunities” or “opportunity costs” essentially economic terms that have nothing to do with love and we see the same in everything else too.\nThis has happened because our real love is consumption of the world’s resources and to some extent consumption of each other. In the post-industrial West, we have to borrow to sustain our consumption. The incompetent activities of governments and banks since the 1970’s and governments in the UK specifically since the 1960’s have fuelled a regrettable debt binge to fuel consumption and maintain “jobs” and the domestic economic system.\nIgnoring the complex world of gold standards and financial regulation, we will concentrate on the bigger picture for the benefit of the less economically inclined.\nFirst some context. By the 1960/70’s it was clear that in “capitalist” countries the inherent “contradictions of capitalism”, (basically it over produces goods and undermines both the value of them and the ability to pay living wages to make them or buy them) were leading to poverty and crime. New “industries” like illegal drugs, porn and prostitution started to replace the traditional industries that were the envy of the world only twenty years earlier. This was the case on both sides of the Atlantic. Of course, governments could employ people; in the forces say but this was paid for out of tax from a declining tax base. The western world was getting poorer, it was a crisis and it was the Cold War… Cripes! There had to be a way to re-engineer the system so it could pay for itself again.\nThere was no way an economy built on taxing profit and increasing levels of income could adapt to this crisis….essentially it was existential. The only possible solution for governments back then was to introduce public ownership of industries, but the 1940’s British experiment was clearly a failure due to “industrial hierarchy” (more of this later) continuing to alienate workers even when in theory they “owned the means of production”.\nIn the US there was no appetite to go down the “socialist” UK model. Jobs were being exported (a process that sped up over the next two decades)and communities were thrown onto the dole or as we call it “the global labour market” but takers for their expensive labour there came none. The careful balancing of the state’s books became difficult as the tax base shrank and the welfare burden increased. Bruce Springsteen made a career out of singing about these “global unemployed” and Ronald Regan couldn’t balance a budget!\nIn the UK whether by accident or design Margaret Thatcher adopted “Thatcherism” a combination of free-market economics and fiscal conservatism. Just as no one could fathom out, back in the day, why Regan made such as a hash of his last budget no one could work out the success of Thatcherism. Factories, mines and shipyards closed but still, the economy carried on apparently “growing”. In the US after Regan, Bush then Clinton reaped the “rewards” of the same phenomenon.\nBack in the UK selling Council homes in deprived areas opened up new avenues for “business” in the finance sector and coincidentally as the North Eastern mines, steel plants and shipyards closed so the Malls sprang up. They sold everything from lingerie to furniture now almost all made in China at very low unit cost but sold at prices comparable to British produced products. Profit margins were healthy for stores “commissioning” these products.\nForeign production costs, borrowing against inflating property prices, including discounted ex-council stock, stocks and shares, and the payment of state salaries and investment with “regeneration budgets” (building new housing and Malls) kept the whole economic show on the road and has done for decades. The whole thing was allowed to simmer rather than boil with Private Finance Initiatives and other means of embedding taxpayers money into the profit margins of corporations no longer able to cut it on the world stage without reliance on the state. To cut costs Governments acting as always in the interests of the “State” rather than the “Nation” swooned into the arms of the financial racketeers. John McDonnell promises the same solution again on an even grander scale to pay for renationalisation.\nThatcher, Major, Blair and Cameron were all symbols of this model which was presented by crony economists and bankers, the City or Wall Street as an anti boom and bust perpetual money machine. However, it could never be that. Only deluded politicians like Blair and Cameron in the UK or Clinton in the US thought this was their passport to immortality. Everyone else from 2003 onwards…us included, held our breath waiting for the collapse. Eventually, it came in 2007/2008.\nThe only solution was to bail out the banks. Other fanciful options could not have worked as the banking sector was central to the whole national ecosystem. If the banks failed in their death throws they would have consumed not only the economy but society as well. So like the six foot tall 20 stone teenage son they had to be indulged with bail out’s and a mass of Quantitative Easing. In an open world, this has done little to rebuild real economies but it has made bankers and asset owners very rich. An unintended consequence? Perhaps less “unintended” than we might think.\nSo working on this analysis having some passable link to the actualete’, western “capitalism” ended in the mid-1980’s when China provided the worlds proletarians to produce cheap goods for a greedy western free market. The west became a free market of racketeers and chancers buoyed up on its own arrogance and incapable of seeing that it’s so-called “wealth” was simply debt based or tax derived, of little or no actual “value”. But for those to whom it flowed it has made life very agreeable whilst making governments fearful of their electorate and the electorate smelling a rat somewhere hostile to their governments.\nNow we referred to “industrial hierarchy” above when talking about Nationalisations in the past. Nothing better illustrates the problem of the “State” now, than the phrase “Industrial Hierarchy”. The State is not the Nation and some parts of the state work better than others, for example, the Constitutional Monarchy works well in the UK. The UK Parliament itself, however, is a shocking bourgeois throwback to the 18th Century which is no longer capable of delivering long-term prosperity for the Nation but being “in charge” is unlikely to concede to any reform.\nHierarchy is a means of running a complex system and when you have few “leaders” it works comparatively well albeit always biased in favour of the “leadership”. When Capitalism replaced the old feudal system it was simply replacing a “there by right” for a “thereby effort or luck”. It created opportunities for the able business person to get rich and the whole “feudal establishment” yielded to the new bourgeois power base.\nThe feudal establishment and institutions could yield because capitalism was a hierarchy. There was a “natural fit”.\nSo why is this a problem today? Well, today we don’t have a capitalist West we have a bankrupt free market. In the west we still have people schooled and socialised to believe they have a natural right to a high public office or large amounts of wealth, however, acquired.\nOur free market is based on mass consumption, not mass production and this consumption is paid for as we have said by tax, asset inflation and debt. Basically, we are no longer being “exploited” in the Marxist sense but to keep our hierarchical legal, political and every other public body in existence (Housing, Health, Education, military etc) with their 100K plus Barrons at the top (we call them the pubicsectocracy) we the people are being alienated into borrowing and allowing our governments to borrow trillions of Pounds or Dollars.\nThe western economic system is the most immoral in history and it is destroying the planet and itself.\nThe problem for the West is two-fold. By saving the banks and not having a long-term contingency to avoid the same problem again we are back on the banker’s money go round and we await the next and probably final cataclysmic failure. What will that usher in? Well, the end of democracy for a start.\nSecondly our binary Parliamentary and two-party system and 5-year cycle democracy (4 in the US) make real democracy and sustainable economic stability impossible. This is why all political parties turn to the short-termism of financial engineering. It is impossible to save ourselves with this model which can only ever favour the banks and commercial interests and not the Nation as a whole.\nBanks are vital to the health of the nation but today it is only ever the banks to the rescue of the state (even for the Labour party) and that’s bad for the Nation.\nThe solution is a Blue Revolution. Ordinary people shaping policy with more democracy not less. Long-term (30 years) planning by ending binary Parliamentary politics and the Party System, not by force but by voting for unaligned candidates. There needs to be a complete overhaul of what the state can and should do and a review of how it does it moving rapidly from an industrial model of service delivery to a “social model” where individual practitioners are interdependent and self-regulating, not top-down managed! and how much the state should pay “its” state people in wages and terms and conditions is also important in a post hierarchy age. This is because state workers are paid out of what are essentially the debts or taxes of the nation …….errrrr that it!",

Old fashioned socialism is premised on the basis that those bad old capitalist need to have their exploitative businesses taken over by the benign state. This is pretty much what happened after WWII. However, the problem became clear by the mid-1970’s the state was bad at running industries and could not do it efficiently and so a programme of sell off’s was embarked on. On the other side of the state equation, the industrial model taken from nationalised industry was deployed to deliver large scale health and education and again it has proved problematic. Local authorities too developed this large scale delivery model with the 1974 reforms. These big delivery models become incapable of adapting and begin to consume resources to maintain themselves rather than deploying resources to the people that need them.\nSo if we end up with a Labour government or some kind of ‘progressive’ alliance will we see a return to the alienating industrial scale delivery of the 1970’s? the evidence seems to suggest that we will and it won’t take long before the whole lot ends up costing more than the country can afford. To understand what to do about this tragic situation we need to understand it’s nature and then develop a new delivery model for the services we need. To do this we need to, first of all, see the country and its people as different from the state, and see the state as a consumer on our behalf. We can then see whether the state as a consumer is costing the country too much and if so whether to use an old Marxist term the state should start to wither away as we develop new delivery models for essential services.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_mark-carney-marx-and-the-decline-of-western-civilisation/content_362.html": "Mark Carney, Marx and the decline of Western civilisation!\nSo now we have the head of the Bank of England Mark Carney pronouncing that Marxism may become relevant because of the technological revolution. He stresses that the Engels Pause which saw low wage growth during the early industrial revolution, explains low wage growth now. Apart from the fact that Marx confined his economic analysis to bushels of corn or yards of linen, how relevant are these observations in a post-capitalist West within an emerging global hegemony?\nFirstly, Marx was writing at a time when the main economic preoccupation was the “surplus value” or profit, created by labour power. Wages ware paid at a level set by the labour market and the downward pressure on wages was caused by the abundant supply of labour rendering wages cheap to the point of survival levels only. Children as young as ten working 12-16 hour shifts in factories.\nThis downward pressure on wages advantaged the capitalists who were able to take greater levels of “surplus value” and in doing so were engaging in a merciless exploitation of their workers.\nAs capitalism settled down, children were removed from the labour market, workers were able to negotiate a better deal for themselves and wage levels rose. The State also intervened to improve the lot of the worker. This is the nub of Marxism, the worker or the State re-appropriated the surplus value previously taken by the capitalist and the capitalist alone. The role of Trades Unions was essentially the same. Take back from the capitalist some of the excessive surplus value generated by the worker in the process of production. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a lot of surplus value and capitalists became very rich and an empire was built on the back of it.\nOf course, increasing output in a capitalist system is important as there would be diminishing profitability without it, but in terms of wage levels, the labour market and government intervention feature more significantly. After any plague, the price of labour power goes up. Machines increase output and of course enhance the wages of those skilled people who remain in work. Labour markets for skilled people are different from the labour market for the unskilled, but they work on the same principles.\nThe issue Carney highlights though is interesting in two further respects. Firstly he fails to address the fact that migration of unskilled labour is a contributory factor in the process of lowering wages, creating downward pressure on wages through oversupply. And he sees the forthcoming crisis of unemployment as likely to re-ignite an interest in Marxist ideas as a solution.\nThe fact economists and politicians seem obsessed with promoting migration suggests that the political system Marx called the bourgeois (capitalist) political system really does have an impulse to lower wages for the worker. And moreover, the left is as guilty as the right in being silent on this issue.\nThe secondly Marxism as a word and an ideology lost all accurate meaning in the 2oth century because of its use to describe fascist, state socialist and feudal dictatorships, all borne of violent revolution and none “Marxian” in any sense Marx would have recognised. However, that doesn’t mean Marxist analysis is completely irrelevant.\nSo how might Marxism become relevant again? This depends on how people use Marxist analysis. Marxism is essentially about two things that spring forth from the capitalist system, one as we have described above is surplus value (profit) and the other is alienation. Alienation is the process by which the worker becomes disassociated from his economic role being a beast of burden to a process or machine.\nToday a capitalist economy Marx would have recognised no longer exists. We are now able or perhaps willing to create national indebtedness to provide a “living wage” to people who have no actual economic function. They create no economic value, and the State isn’t taking surplus value from the bourgeois, it’s taxing and indebting the workers too many of whom are employed by the State itself. We are in some senses living in a post-Marxian age already.\nThe critical relevance about Marx, however, isn’t about wages. Marx was an advocate of material determinism. He basically believed that the economic system creates social values which are necesary to promote the interests of the economic system itself.\nSo, our bourgeois values of contract, choice and consent freedom and democracy which were necessary for the capitalist system to function profitably have taken on a social character and we all expect rights based on these principles today. However, if the nature of the economy becomes as we have suggested debt based with little role for productive Western workers i.e. not creating surplus value or profit, will the values that the economy requires and therefore society requires, alter significantly? The answer is, of course, yes if you apply a Marxian analysis.\nCapitalism in the West is coming to an end and Marx’s economic relevance at a National level has perhaps been eclipsed as the British economy is now global. On that basis, the post-capitalist West probably is sliding back towards a feudal model of power and control and Marx can help explain this. This change is necessary as the economic system operates globally and there is little need for capitalist values of contract, choice and consent at the bottom of this global system i.e. at the bottom of the National level. This is mainly because being dependent on an indebted government for welfare is not a contracted arrangement it is more feudal in character.\nIt’s a wild speculation but the sympathetic approach given to Islamic values which are in total contrast to Contract, Choice and Consent suggest that autocratic and discriminatory principles have some advocates in the world, who are happy to risk pushing aside contract, choice and consent, particularly for women, in the interests of preserving the global economic hegemony.\nWhen capitalism leaves by the front door its values will according to Marx leave by the back. And as we are progressing towards a more and more unfair global economy, by crystallising the worlds current injustices, injustices will be reflected into any society once based on “just” principles of contract, choice and consent, freedom and democracy. Someone out there knows that and doesn’t care. Hence the attack on free speech and the nonsense of hate crime as opposed to “crime” across the western world.\nSo, to answer the question is Carney right to conclude that Marxism will have relevance in the future. The answer is probably yes in the sense of offering an insight into how the values of the global economy create injustice around the world and yes in terms of reframing our understanding of how the global economy maintains power structures and erodes rights in the face of mass Western unemployment. But to offer an insight into wage levels in a post-capitalist West. Marx is probably irrelevant.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_introduction-to-our-soon-to-be-published-new-manifesto/content_37.html": "Introduction to our soon to be published new manifesto.\nDear Voter,\nHave you heard of the expression: ‘when you need something to believe in, start with yourself?’ This is a comment often cited, and, at its very essence, is ‘truth’. Basically, if you want something badly enough, then you have to do it yourself; you cannot rely on others to accomplish what you want to achieve.\nThis mind-set transposes from day-to-day activities to the world of ‘politics’, be it at a national, regional or local level. The attitude amongst the majority of people on the electoral roll amounts to ‘Oh not again’, ‘just get on with it’, or ‘my vote doesn’t change a single thing, so why bother?’ Hence, low turn-outs at elections are an inevitability, which benefits those with a vested interest. It is that ‘elite’ who, through an assumed apathy and distrust of the existing political system shown by the voters, are able to be elected by default and thus become very comfortable as a democratically elected representative who does not have the support of the majority of voters but revels on those who did not turn out to vote, because of a total distrust in the current system.\nOf course, under any democratic system, it is your right to vote as you choose. This is not under dispute. What is questionable, however, is this: if you vote for a traditional party under the English electoral system, is your voice really being heard? If you reflect on that question, are you satisfied that you are making an impact? Or, is there a doubt in your mind: a voice that says: ‘my opinion counts for nothing: my vote perpetuates the status quo where those with vested interests are able to pursue their personal interests behind the guise of a democratic election?\nThis is why the average person on the street; the office worker, the teacher, the shelf-stacker, the unemployed, the homeless, the nurse, the refuse disposal operatives, to give them the politically correct description, otherwise known as dustbin men guys, the student, in fact anyone, has no real faith in traditional politics, or even dare I say, in new politics. This needs to be corrected: quickly and without delay, because otherwise we, as a population, are prepared to be consumed by a system which does not care for us, does not appreciate our feeling and perceptions, but chooses to ignore them at their convenience. And do you know what: I accept that premise; ‘I get it’. I have often felt that living in a particular location, necessarily implies that however I vote won’t make a single jot of difference, so why bother voting: nothing will change despite my opinion, so quite frankly I can’t be bothered.\nAre you correct in your assumptions? Once, I would have said ‘Yes’: now, I say ‘No’. Why has this shift come about? It is quite simple: I have become aware of The Blue Revolution.\nIt is important from the outset to state that this organisation is not a political party in the accepted understanding of the phrase. In essence, it is a political ‘movement’. My first concern was an incorrect implication I arrived that: ‘blue’ being the colour of the Conservative Party, which indeed it is, just as ‘Red’ is synonymous with the Labour Party and\n‘yellow’ is the colour adopted by the Lib-Dems. In the instance of The Blue Revolution the colour refers to ‘blue collar people’: the anonymous person often quoted as being Mr or Mrs Average, who are disregarded as being not within the determinants of ‘need’ and also not within the realms of the ‘wealthy’ who, frankly, are not concerned with everyday issues anyway given their immense wealth.\nThe Blue Revolution is an entirely new concept in political thinking. Here is an approach to politics which welcomes political thought from any stance. Here is an approach which can totally restructure the accepted norms of political interaction. Here is an organisation which accepts and incorporates the input from the electorate without assumptions drawn. Here is a way of thinking which breaks through the traditional divide and welcomes views from any perspective and appreciates the contributions from a diversity of inputs, rather than disregarding them without any fear of retribution, since they are safely ensconced within the establishment that adopts a ‘laissez-faire’ conceptualisation.\nThe Blue Revolution has, at its essence, a goal of reconciliation: It accepts that people are disillusioned with politics at whatever level, be it national, regional or local. How many times have you heard expressions such as this with regard to Brexit: ‘please, just get on with it and stop arguing?’ We accept the premise that ‘from little acorns, great Oaks grow’. We are not going to take over the leadership of the UK parliament for the foreseeable future: probably never; most definitely never.\nWhat we can do, however, is make a start. By that, we mean on the local level, here in Boston.\nWe can make certain promises. We cannot be ‘whipped’ into a traditional party political system. That is because we are apart from that ideology: we are free-thinking individuals who will take on board the opinions from any political viewpoint, in full acceptance of what has been divulged to us.\nWe can make a difference: a ‘real’ difference and here is the reason why. We will address the issues that affect you, as a resident of Boston, but without political confines. Whatever you think is a positive about our town which needs highlighting, or indeed a negative which needs investigation and relevant action, The Blue Revolution could be in a position to respond to you in a way that traditional party politics cannot do, especially in a Borough Council election, when one has to consider whether national party alliances have anything relevant to add to the local concerns and issues relating to our town.\nWe, as an organisation, rather than a pre-determined labelled political party, would very much appreciate your support in our journey to ‘question’ what is accepted. We will attempt to do this in the spirit of inclusion, as opposed to exclusion, which the existing system necessarily encapsulates and encourages.\nBelieve in yourself; question your opinions, and support your local Blue Revolution candidate. You know you want to, so here is your chance.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_we-are-troubled-by-the-hard-lefts-collusion-with-political-islam-are-you/content_338.html": "We are troubled by the hard ‘Left’s’ collusion with political Islam, Are you?\nIslam is unashamedly seventh century as a faith and political ideology. Very simply its values go back to the days of tribal agrarianism and have a doctrine of ‘no change’ dictated from God to Muhammad by the Archangel Gabriel. Individual Muslims may change but the faith upon which they depend does not. It won’t reform, it can’t reform!\nIslam is, therefore, pre ‘rights’ which only came along as a realistic expectation for some men in the 18th century with the freedom to contract, make choices and consent, requirements of the emerging capitalist system. Back then, these rights were really only available to ‘capitalists’ who were also known as ‘the bourgeois’. Most people back then didn’t count, they were ‘workers’ but in theory, they had the same rights as the capitalist.\nIslam being of the seventh century makes no reference to peoples rights but instead has control, compulsion and submission at its core. These are values totally at odds with what we have come to expect today. That is not surprising, however, ‘hand to mouth’ tribal societies that relied on brutality and ‘booty’ both human and economic, such as the one Muhammad came from would all have been exactly the same. Muhammad simply turned seventh-century economic necessity into an ideology or ‘faith’ and it’s been exported around the world ever since!\nSo why do the political “hard Left’ support Islam with its pre rights values, its control and submission ideology? It seems odd to us that within the ranks of Antifa’s and other so-called progressive ‘Leftwing’ groups’ people rail against those who, far from being ‘Islamophobic’ or racist, are simply trying to stand up for modern ‘western values’. Basically standing up for the right of all men and women to contract, make personal choices and consent as this is the legacy of our capitalist past. Upon these values, we have built freedom and democracy.\nSo the explanation. As with all dumbing down, it seems as though the ‘Left’ don’t really understand the principles of Left-wing philosophy described by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels and therefore don’t recognise that by supporting Islam and destroying ‘capitalism’ in the way they advocate, they are falling into the trap of promoting regressive ideas. They see ‘capitalism’ simply as a bad system to be overthrown wholesale rather than one where the values should be preserved and extended to working people, whilst change occurs at an institutional level.\nIslamic radicals see in the hard ‘Left’ people who like them, violently hate capitalism and also seem to hate Western values too. Maybe yes or maybe no!\nAre there ‘Left-wingers’ and Antifa’s who know what they are doing and have misogyny driving their indifference to women and girls rights when they support Islam? There may well be some but the reality for us is the modern Uk and the US ‘Left-wing’ doesn’t understand that overthrowing ‘capitalism’ should not involve overthrowing capitalism’s values but only changing capitalisms unfair ‘bourgeois’ institutions. Institutions like it’s binary Parliaments, Local Authorities, State broadcasters, and established religion plus the unrepresentative bourgeois Political Parties.\nBy being cavalier with capitalisms values the left is at risk of throwing our ‘rights’ baby out with their anti-capitalist bathwater. Should we be concerned? Well yes because more out of ignorance than intent, the ‘Left’ is ushering modern civilisation out the door whilst the seventh-century climb in via the window.",

It’s so 20th Century!\nGosh it never ceases to amaze us just how 20th century our politicians are. ‘Cradle to grave wealth redistributive socialism and nationalisation from Labour as the Tories consolidate the middle ground and make it theirs with some post war one nation Conservatism. The dialogue between the two reflects a class war from Labour as the Tories critique tax and spend whilst speaking to the whole nation from the One Show sofa. What is wrong with all this is that it is all so 20th Century. But how so?\nWell not only does Macron speak about the failed political system so does Corbyn. In Corbyn and Labours’ case, they are accused of being Marxist, presumably because questioning parliamentarialism’ is the same as revolutionary communism in the minds of some Conservatives. But does Corbyn know this, does he know what parliamentarialism is, does he mean that parliamentarialism is the problem in modern Britain. However whilst policy comes in spade loads, spluttered out all half baked and barely understood by those communicating it, there is no solution offered to the problem of parliamentarialism. And parliamentarialism is a problem. Corbyn’s solution, like Macron’s is simply to get into parliament and to introduce a policy on say tax or nationalisation …..not to change the system.\nThe British Parliamentary system is a 200-year-old system which was always intended to be a representative model that allowed an ‘elite’ to manage the British nation on behalf of ‘the people’. Of course ‘the people’ were not the rag tag of bonded workers (a legacy of the feudal system) or the emerging proletariat, they would scarcely count as people at all. The people was a combination of the landowners and the emerging capitalist classes who identified with parties who represented them. From the Whig’s and Tories emerged the Liberals and Tories and then Tories and Labour. Each party reflecting the interests of different social ‘classes’ as history marched forward. The problem which 20th century Corbyn doesn’t understand and the Tories ignore is that we are too diverse and the economy too, fragmented to render our existing parliamentary system a good model for running the country. People feel that the ‘state’ and the parliamentary system fails the sniff test because to work a parliamentary system, has to bracket people into groups similar to classes and with modern diversity, people don’t see the full range of their interests or concerns being reflected in policy from either of the main parties, apart from Brexit that is. It gets worse once the party is in parliament due to the party system and the whip taking away the independence politicians should be allowed to have. Their naive, well-intentioned former selves become machined in the party system as a ‘career in politics’ beckons.\nThe radical solution is the Blue Revolution’s Legislative College.

But identifying with Marx is very different from thinking like Marx. It is sadly true that no politician of the modern era thinks like Marx and indeed Lenin, Stalin and Mao would all have been considered ‘false prophets’ by Marx himself. He was a champion of working people and their lived experience. He also disliked the bourgeois attempt to hide its ‘slavery’ under a canopy of righteous concern be it by a charity or the State.\nIn economics, therefore, how is burdening the working class taxpayer with National Debt by trying to promote the interests of the rich with bourgeois economics in the form of neoclassical Keynesianism in any way Marxist?\nIn sociology how is the lefts ‘identity’ obsession even remotely promoting the interests of workers when these identity obsessions have abandoned any link to workers lived experience. The basis for Marxism is in science, not woolly idealism imposed from the top down.\nNext time this Marxist ‘holy trinity’ bore the TV viewer with their opinions on how Marxist they are, take it with a pinch of salt. No one who grandstands above the working people is a Marxist. In their case, they are merely well-camouflaged members of the bourgeoisie. Or less politely…..class traitors.",

We offer a new paradigm.\nThe western world has morphed from a capitalist hegemony into a so-called free market. The transition began after World War two and culminated we believe in the final collapse of capitalism in the 1980’s. The legacy of the West’s capitalist past remains its economic and legal vestiges of contract, choice and consent which whilst granting freedoms also, underpin the growth through debt obsessed ‘free market, the new hegemony of the free world. This debt based free market is the basis for the West’s managed decline. A sad declining world where we are not alienated from our human essence by the capitalist means of production, that went east decades ago, but by our personal obsessions be they consumption, sex or dreams of celebrity. Whilst this is alienation, Marx would have recognised few of the symptoms and none of the cause.\nYoung people on the continent riot with flags that proclaim “we are fucking angry”. But we don’t really understand what they are angry about. They seem troubled by what they call Capitalism but whilst now gone this system gave them the free market, freedom and democracy and the right to be a woman and equal to a man or gay or transgendered and free. Arguably the West’s hegemonic structures such as the IMF, governments and banking system etc ensure that there is a ready supply of largely valueless wealth to slosh around the globe ensuring that the decline of the West will be almost imperceptible to the naked eye so no need to panic and riot.\nThe bankers and the elite will, of course, take a generous slice of this valueless debt based wealth and will ensure their survival in some middle eastern kingdom once the global system finally forecloses on the western world’s largesse. At that point, it will be time to riot but it will be too late all the freedoms the rioting youth currently enjoy will be gone and a morality which is coherent with crisis and shortages and anger will replace them, something like fascism or Sharia perhaps.\nThe rioting youth need to understand that the basic factors that underpin our so called western values are economic not just social of theological. The engine of the economy drives values which over time take on a social character and become’culture’. Once the economic fundamentals are gone, in our case capitalism has gone and the free market is bankrupt and will be going so, the rights and freedoms those systems offer will go too. Unless we seek to understand where they come from and preserve them.\nIt is no good rioting when you have freedom and your belly is full and you are the beneficiary of a system you claim to hate, a system which puts the individual in the west above the rest. Change the system peacefully or as Marx would have said ‘raise your consciousness’ and don’t wait too long to do it. You might end up rioting for your life or find yourself being treated like a woman or man as defined by someone else.\nSo if the Islamic paradigm is twisting in the wind all over the middle east, (except in Saudi where money keeps it going) and the West is facing nemesis for its debt based hubris what will a new paradigm look like. Well, quite simply we should live a life of modesty and self-restraint largely unimpeded by an expensive state or exploitation by one group over another. There must be a recognition nay celebration that in post-capitalist times our capitalist legacy has given us freedoms no other culture has had or currently enjoys to the extent we do, and that to preserve our freedoms we must preserve capitalism’s core values and not out of greed or stupidity seek to destroy them.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-mess-of-globalisation-and-the-collusion-of-the-left-our-take-on-it/content_174.html": "The “mess” of “globalisation” and the collusion of the “left”. Our take on it!\nIt seems completely crazy but at some point in the last forty years, the global elite decided that with collapsing capitalism at home the future was “engineered” (as opposed to organic) “global” capitalism. Not a global capitalism which brought countries into the “freedom family” of trading nations based on contract, choice and consent, but a global capitalism “gamed” in the interests of failing western economies.\nThis programme promoted by amongst others Bush, Blair and Clinton has failed spectacularly and has resulted in failed states, failing economies, mass migration and the relentless reduction in western workers real incomes and freedom.\nIt all started just after Ronald Regan left office (or so we say!). A Republican running a massive budget deficit was a symptom of a crisis in the US economy. American capitalism was on its knees and no one seemed able to rescue it. The only option was to go global. To ensure the primacy of the west in this new global reality it had to be gamed promoting the interests of the west above all others.\nThis global system being manipulated by the corporate/political elite ensured western economic superiority. The problem was that to maintain this broken system debt has replaced profitability. Workers and governments of the west have had to maintain this system, finding themselves promoting the interests of a global super-elite at their own financial expense. We call this process debtamorphosis.\nThis debt based model hit the buffers in 2007 and will do again as nothing has changed. The “Left” trill that “austerity” is damaging the economy. They are the useful idiots of the global elite. They are exactly what the global elite want. People prepared to pump taxpayers debt into their global system to keep them rich. We call this western model Secular-Westernism.\nIn addition to getting greater indebtedness to maintain demand in the western economy, the elite and political “Hawks”, realised there was a need to get cash into the failing western worlds coffers as well. They started to embark on a democratisation project that would “help” to rid nations of their tyrants like Saddam in Iraq, None of this met the test of “justice” it couldn’t it wasn’t based on Contract, Choice and Consent. It was imposed by force. Tony Blair still believes it was a “just” war. But “justice” in capitalism means contracted and consented to, not forced. The west in this way was acting like a feudal tyrant.\nWe believe they accepted that there would be collateral damage but reconstruction contracts would assist in the rebuilding of these new democracies, helping western nations financially. Like everything you can write on the back of a fag packet, this project failed spectacularly.\nIt failed because the values of contract, choice and consent needed in a democracy are products only of a capitalist system, itself a product of scientific and rational thinking. No other type of economy creates an understanding and a willing application of these principles of contract, choice and consent. That is why they are alien values in feudal, tribal and many Islamic countries.\nSo having bombed Iraq the western “Hawks” expected a grateful nation to welcome freedom, women’s rights, a free press, self-restraint, toleration of difference etc. Er no. If you understood the rudiments of Marx’s political economics it would have been clear that all that would happen is what has happened, these nations, now broken, have reverted to tribal and sectarian infighting. The rights of women, gay people and Jewish people, Christians and other foreign nationals have been ripped asunder. It’s wasn’t supposed to be like that but that is precisely how it is. There is also mass migration on a continental scale to deal with. This issue is one that is seemingly without an easy solution.\nLike the countries from which the migrants come there is no rich heritage of contract, choice and consent, so their economic and therefore cultural reference points are from a period Karl Marx and Frederick Engles called “barbarism”. In modern terms, very many are sexist, racist, homophobic and violent, because that was what it had to be like in traditional pre-feudal economies. The individual faithful can’t be blamed any more than you can blame a westerner for wanting to be a millionaire. Values are economic as well as culturally determined! What however one can say is this. Having introduced people who have values unlike our own how are you going to assimilate them? They will typically not want to assimilate preferring to group with those with whom they share values in common.\nTo cover their tracks and avoid blame for what has been done to so many western nations, the global elite seems to have the unexpected help of the “hard left” who assist by aggressively shutting down the views of working people with shrill cries of racism, or Islamophobia. For politics supposedly based on Marx’s scientific socialism, these hard left groups are too prone to “differentiate” the working population and are too ready to accept pre-capitalist values.\nSo, in conclusion, in addition to western workers jobs going east and debt replacing profitability, we have illegal and immoral adventurism on the part of a western economic elite. Seeing that western capitalism was failing, these people developed a strategy of “war reconstruction and democracy building”. This strategy has failed and has led to mass migration. We also have various iterations of a left-wing keen to build a “proletarian army” from a differentiated collection of people with identity issues and this, in the case of shouts of “Islamism”, is being used to silence working peoples natural objection to what has happened to their countries. Kleptocrats and the hard left both on the same page? You really couldn’t make it up.",

Living the dream of “smashing the hated Tories” decades after the Tories stopped being a threat to anyone but themselves. Corbyn really believes he has set the country on fire with his skilled orations. In reality though his supporters have no idea what is really going on, who is shafting who and what they should do about it. So they buy into the simplicities of 1970’s “socialism” because it is a familiar blast from the past for many, and beats returning to pot smoking or thinking for yourself. Get the megaphone out and chant “what do we want…..the Tories out…..when do we want it……NOW!” It’s a great way to stay fit and get some fresh air in middle age. For the Facebook generation it’s simply about shifting their debt onto the States books.\nOne thing Comrade Corbyn did get right however was that politics has drifted the “centre ground” to the left….He isn’t totally stupid. However the Tories having moved left don’t really have the intellectual heft to understand why they have had to do that. They think it is because Corbyn’s ideas are so compelling, to stand any chance of power in the future the gravity of politics has to move towards Corbyn. Of course this is nonsense.\nPolitics moved the centre ground to the right under the hated Blair and stayed right through Brown and Cameron emerging still right wing but failing under Mrs May. Up until the managerial Mrs May, there was a beautiful planetary alignment which saw a rather silly ideology consolidate around a handful of right wing simplicities. Most notable of these simplicities was a belief in the power of the liberated free market to deliver economic and social justice through personal and government debt.\nOf course not only could an unregulated free market not deliver social justice, the economics of this system were brutal too, as the bottom 50% of the population saw their jobs disappear abroad, their wage levels pushed to the minimum wage by waves of unskilled migration, and their personal debt rocket to pay for an empty meaningless lifestyle which subsidised the top 50% with income from the poorer peoples personal debt.\nThis people is the most immoral system ever created by man. A system where the poor are forcibly indebted by their government to pay for a wealthy elite. It is slavery in all but name.\nHowever the miserable saga doesn’t end there. Blair and Cameron and Osborne were convinced that this post industrial economic system would work. But of course it has to feed some kind of value in to support the debt and that value was the fluctuating value of stock and property which even when cleverly packaged as a “collateralised debt obligation” still failed the sniff test. Hence the aftermath in 2007/08\nSo with the western economic model still failing under the assumed auspicious conditions of the right….the only possible option for the average person is that there maybe something on the left that can sort out the obvious fact that Anglo Saxon economics is finished. And so we have Jeremy and his happy band of conned and deluded students and overweight 1970’s and 1980’s student activists complete with megaphones tempted back to perform angry protest. A sort of new Angry Brigade, all primed and ready to do business sorting out the system. But this will be by getting the poor old taxpayer into more debt whilst looking after the interests of the Labour party, its supporters and interest groups.\nSo what does Blue Revolution make of all this. Well we believe the western model is to coin a phrase a house built on sand. There is no way of avoiding the stark truth of that and so we need to stop talking politics based on parties and have a democracy based on realism, not short term party self interest.\nWe can’t afford the modern British state. The political Parties all want to run the State but they can’t, it’s unaffordable, unfit for purpose and needs massive reform. They can’t do that reform. The Left wing and the right wing have no suggestions as to how we can save our country and our culture so our country and culture are seriously at risk from them.\nOh and people wonder why there is an increase in Anti Semitism in the Labour Party. Apart from the religious composition of Northern Constituencies the reason is that they know that their policy of debt and more debt won’t solve the West’s or Britains problems and will only make matters significantly worse. Who do you blame when you have actually made matters worse, perhaps existentially worse. Well you don’t blame yourself or the people who vote for you…you blame mankind’s Shylock, Fagin or money lender….you blame the Jews. It was never your borrowing that is to blame….it was their lending! That is even if Jewish business still run the banks. Our guess is they got out of banking years ago!\nSo what of the party conferences. Well they have both reflected the shift left from Blairs shift right. But neither party has an answer as the answer is less of them and more of a State run democratically by people with the values morals and skills to do it properly in everyone’s interest. Not simply the short term party interest!",

Whether it is the unacknowledged exploitation of women by men in tribal culture or a feudal system furnished with value by serfs or slaves history to date teaches us that we are only slowly falteringly or in Donald Trump’s case groping our way towards more enlightened times. The enlightenment is within eye and earshot but still not achievable yet. But Why?\nAs economic determinists, we believe that to fully realise a progressive evolutionary shift we need to understand where exploitation lays in the current economic system. We have, we hope explained that there are groups of influential people out there happily manufacturing industries that allow them to line their own pockets with government cash much of this government cash is debt based and paid for by the worker. The most significant of these groups are the ambulance chasing lawyers pursuing minor public sector and health workers plus soldiers for “compensation”. Alleged wrongdoing is the context for litigation. The compensation is the self-justifying pretext for court action but the much more important subtext are the legal costs!\nThe law-makers being lawyers is a breach of the separation of powers but one that the lawyers, that generally quite process observant group are quite happy to overlook. There is also the fact that the law is expected to pay well so lawmakers are paid well too. Lawyer as policy and lawmakers is one reason that the interests of blue collar workers have been overlooked for too long. Our needs are secondary to the needs of the State to protect its officers, members, and hangers-on and keep the whole process hidden by a veil of legal legitimacy . This explains the left alliances (Greens, Lib Dems and Labour Party in the UK’s obsession with staying in the EU). It is only very remotely about trade it is really about maintaining the EU political system for the benefit of the Junkers and Tusks and the UK’s “left-wing” hangers on and duff politicians . For their “class” to survive the EU has to survive. This makes what the UK did in voting out as cutting edge revolutionary as anywhere in the word for many, many decades; possibly even centuries. Well done. The Blue Collar revolution starts from here. The three millennia of rule by one elite after another will start to change from here on in.\nHowever, there is one element of UK domestic policy which we believe is exploitative and which also supports the State’s overall aim of maintaining control for its elites which justifies well-paid state employment at the highest level. And that is the subsidisation and growth of the underclass. This shameless bit of social engineering has cast millions of lives into a mire of hopelessness resulting for males in drug, alcohol and crime and women into premature motherhood before that are emotionally equipped to look after themselves let alone a small defenceless child. The advantage of this horribly broken system is that it allows the left wing parties to talk the language of caring whilst promoting a system which keeps workers paying and the state receiving and the underclass locked into a moral and economic “double lock” that allows them little chance of escape. The underclass feeds the State monster, directly through the need to manage them via government jobs and government departments such as the Justice department and indirectly by encouraging workers from abroad to migrate to do low skilled work, thus pleasing the EU overlords. Migration puts pressure on the housing market so housebuilders do Ok as does the Government via taxes on building and sale.\nWe believe the Blue Collar revolution, the proper worker’s revolution needs to tackle the problem of the exploitation of the worker’s root (the underclass) and branch (the elite)\n23.10.16 Contract, Choice and Consent; a Blue Revolution’s global “trideology” for the rest of the 21st and the 22nd century and beyond.\nThe “ideology” of the EU and we have recently concluded the “ideology” of “New Labour” (RIP) are similar in one specific respect; they are both premised on the belief that social justice can be delivered by a theological or ideological “socialist” state. Free movement of people, whole swathes of people, the very young, the very old and the disabled moved around the continent to access better welfare, education and health all on the “ticket” of often a single “worker”. This is the inception of the dream of the EU social and economic engineers; a continent united in one single belief system and one single market. However it is about 200 years too premature and on this basis, it will break before it can be made to work. The analogy we would use is that the EU theologians are trying to transplant an old established Oak tree rather than cultivate a sapling and take their time over it. They are killing the tree.\nThere are lots wrong with the EU….its currency trapping weak economies into an unsustainable economic model, the free movement of people stoking up resentment for reasons obvious to anyone other than the elite. The over inflation of economies within the Customs Area of the EU luring the illiterate and the morally immature from North Africa. The consequences of “hubristic humanitarianism” on vulnerable EU communities and women.\nSo what is to be done. Well, we believe that to unite the world to encourage growth, trade and reduce the risk of war we need to promote a set of ideas that have obvious moral appeal and to a wide and culturally diverse world, and hence we have distilled “Marxism” and produced a spirit of freedom captured in Contract, Choice and Consent, our “trideology”. These three rights are drawn from Capitalism and are a legacy of that economic model conferring rights that under feudalism were denied to too many people……in fact denied to all peoples.\nThe EU needs to realise that its policy of self-promotion is denying countries that need to develop a modern morality the opportunity to do so it is doing this by discouraging the cleansing of relationships associated with free trade. The EU is not a safe pair of hands and neither is the rest of the self-regarding and the self-promoted western world…and that includes the ideological “left” who see wealth rather than rights as the main objective of their “socialism”. Grow up guys!\n28.10.16 Saint Tone, a Patron Saint of the EU theocracy offers us advice on Brexit. He like they simply don’t get it!\nThe theocrats of the EU have dispatched one of their big guns to patronise and plead on behalf of the EU elite. On the UK’s BBC radio 4 morning show, Tony Blair dished up the usual meal of warmed up “third-way” leftovers and a defence of the EU status quo which confirmed the self-regarding, paranoid and delusional view of economics, politics and society that characterises much of the Remain side of debate.\nClearly, the British people didn’t know what they were doing in voting for Brexit and don’t know what they are doing in continuing to support Brexit. The implications are that much misery will befall them and they will have to rely on their elites to sort out the ensuing Brexit mess. It could not occur to Blair because he is incapable of self-criticism that the politically mature and independently minded British might be prepared to endure short-term problems in some economic areas such as lower house prices and increased inflation as a bi-product of gaining proper democratic accountability and a reduction in the power of the technocrats and the elite. Of course, it is arguable that much of what is going on in the economy is simply a correction ofter years of EU economic engineering. The British economy needs to start living in the real world; the world of risk, value, price and profit and loss. It needs to leave the safe haven of the Alice in Wonderland economics of Tusk, Junker, Schultz…..oh and Blair. This is a world where the Elite game the economy to meet the economic, political and sociological needs of the elite themselves and use the economic levers of mass migration, Quantitative Easing and low-interest rates to create artificial short term “confidence” and thereby maintain aggregate demand across a range of EU strategic sectors. Of course, the beneficiaries of this “economic model” are the elite who fob the masses off with cheap debt and a morally ambiguous liberal social policy. All of this combines to create a long-term toxic blend of expectations and entitlements that the European economy can only hope to deliver in the short to medium term and will fail to deliver in the long term. They will fail because society will falter with too little collective social responsibility and economies will buckle under the strain of debt, ageing populations, mass migration and an absence of proper global competition keeping business sharp.\nWhat Blair et don’t understand because they are beneficiaries of the existing system is that economic value and progressive social values are longer being delivered by Western leaders in the western world. The British public have grasped this ahead of the rest of the EU and are the first to demand something is done about it; Brexit!\n29.10.16 If it were not for the ability to store value or transform debt into wealth would we be able to reveal and then solve the “puzzle of history”!\nIt was Karl Marx who said: “communism is the puzzle of history solved”. However, we have had almost one hundred years to become familiar with “communism” and it really hasn’t “solved”anything. The same goes for “socialism”; grand theories that eventually draw power to the state and thereby undermine society and an individual’s ability to fulfil their “species-essence”. So if everyone from Lenin to Corbyn has got it wrong what does “getting it right” look like. We consider whether the real workers Blue revolution solves history’s final puzzle, thereby bringing about the fabled “End of History”.\nWell firstly whether it is Communism or Socialism the actual application of the principles of both have been poorly interpreted. In the case of “socialism”, the State has shown a great reluctance to diminish its power and control and indeed under Blair in the UK and others around the world “the State” and its army of technocrats has grown as the power of western Capitalism has diminished. With Capitalism now unable to generate sufficient value to feed the workers the arms and legs of the state have stepped in to manage the operating environment of whatever bits of the productive and job-creating economy still remain active in the west. This is essentially managing the environment of the “free market” and ensuring that the real liquidity of the free market namely “confidence” is maintained. This has differed within the various parts of “the west”, but we would claim it is fair to say that the EU’s expansion was a stitch up by socialist technocrats intended to mitigate the effects of capitalism’s drift to cheaper areas of the world, and to ensure they and their class had a job for life. We call these people the “publicsectocracy”; they are the aristocracy of the “socialist system”.\nHas this socialist experiment of state management of the economic environment worked? Well, we would say yes and no. A state takes a lot of money to manage an economy and maintain the politics and social policy which rests upon it. In the UK there has been a programme of social policies since the end of WWII which could be described as progressive and the welfare state; a 19th-century idea now bloated and malfunctioning, was great in its time. Brexit proves however that overall model fails the public’s “sniff test”. Too much debt, too many pointless ” infrastructure projects”, too much immigration to fill up the city centres whilst the indigenous populations flee to the newly built out of town estates, family collapse and re-configuration driving housing demand along with the growing realisation that a worker’s right to a home will play second fiddle to the housing industry, lawyers and government, a government like all governments that needs tax revenue. Immigration, gaming the housing market in favour of builders, and the demand from family breakdown, all justifies what we call the mythology of the manufactured housing shortage. As if all that were not enough there is a moral decline as the free market “marketises” everything base including genitalia and sexual behaviour. What used to titillate older men, sooth the lonely and make schoolboys snigger is now part of the mainstream economy; it has to be, there isn’t as much of a real “value creating” economy left!\nSo overall, socialism has, like the political elite and the underclass it’s two great demographic creations, been around too long. Its army of highly paid functionaries and lawyers has become like the aristocrats of the old feudal system, unwilling or unable to see how they stand in the way of progress. So what of Communism?\nCommunism has never existed anywhere on the planet. The revolutions of the past were industrial revolutions orchestrated by the state which gave rise to rapid increases in the value the economy could create and thus gave a legitimacy to the claim higher living standards were due to “communism” as people became better off. This increase in value based wealth happened in the west under actual Capitalism. Some “Communist” or rather state capitalist societies like post-revolutionary Russia have finally settled back to become more “socialist” in character, rather more along western lines. This seems to us to be because socialism was or is what “communism” in Russia really was namely State control of the economic environment rather than by for and of the people! So in terms of solving the riddle of history, hmmm mmmm. More work to do.\n02.11.16 Trump and the White House yes or no? We endorse diversity so why shouldn’t a man with a personality disorder become President.\nAs revolutionaries, we accept that whilst revolutions in the 21st century should not be blood letting they might be gut wrenching. And so it will be with a Trump Presidency. Trump is clearly a man with one if not two personality disorders the most obvious being narcissism but with a bit of borderline thrown in too and perhaps some……..no we will stick to two. Anyway, we were debating Trump the other day and discussing the aftermath of a Trump win. It was suggested that the CIA might do him in, which whilst always possible in trigger-happy America seems unlikely.\nThe man is a revolutionary in that he has persuaded the sad, delusional and ill-informed that he stands up for them. Corbyn says the same thing in the United Kingdom and has attracted a similar constituency. However, whereas Corbyn’s natural supporters are the neurotic waifs and strays of the democratic process, Trump’s people are the gun toting and paranoid. His people hate the establishment, code word for the Clintons, as much as they fear the lawless underclass. They are sad and emotionally abandoned people though just like the lawless underclass they fear so much. As true apostles of the principles of diversity we at a Blue Revolution, however, fear no one including a President Trump; gut-wrenching as that prospect might be. Even a man with his obvious emotional shortcomings can be president in the 21st century; the US constitution almost shouts that at you as you pop out of the womb on US soil. But why do we think this way?\nWell Trump’s election as President will lead to a whole lot of soul searching as the US considers the implications of electing such an odd character to the highest office in the land, and what such a result will say to the world about the brash, money obsessed and shallow state of the American electorate as engineered, just like the UK’s not quite so lawless underclass, by a greedy and self-interested political elite. But that elite is the alternative.\nWe only had one word of caution about the election of President Trump and that was he has executive control of the codes to launch a nuclear attack. Apparently, these codes can be deployed without challenge by special advisers or military chiefs being used at the President’s discretion, causing a nuclear conflagration in fifteen minuted (four minutes to launch!).\nHowever as we have concluded that in a just world even someone as mad as Trump can be President, it doesn’t mean his special needs don’t deserve some special treatment. Therefore we recommend the appointment of the Presidential psychiatric team, who can quickly step in and deal with the US’s first President with “Special needs” and section him if required. Thus avoiding WWIII becomes a matter of his capacity for office rather than the failings of the US constitution. As our old friend Karl Marx said: “from each according to his ability to each according to his special needs”. With that proviso, we Blue Revolutionaries give a cautious thumbs up to President Trump.\nWith apologies to Karl Marx.\n03.11.16 Sharia courts in the UK! Is this really a problem? We consider the issue.\nSharia courts in the UK are accused of discriminating against women. Well, we consider the issue. Imagine a type of world where a person took responsibility for the decisions they make and were held to account. One might conclude that this is like the contract based western world where you agree to any arrangements you subject yourself to be it an employment contract or a personal loan. However when money is involved the T’s and C’s are usually rigidly enforced not so when the issue is about relationships. In the context of relationships, family life or the mundane humdrum stuff there is no direction or guidance in the west just a government willing to pick up the tab for people’s mistakes. People marry and divorce having children they can’t afford, conduct illicit relationships out of narcissism or a desire to hurt a no longer desired partner. A Sharia court only discriminates against people who have made informed decisions they now want to change. The critical question is; was the decision they made to start with, based on Contract, Choice and Consent?\nWell, the answer to this is quite simple. If the issue that is taken to the Sharia court was entered into willingly and there is no suggestion of abuse or coercion then the matter of the Sharia court is one of ensuring that people behave responsibly. We could do with a kind of Sharia court within the secular western world so we can start to tackle the blight of the irresponsible underclass.\n05.11.16 Uk’s High Court interferes with “Brexit”. The strategic wing of the publicsectocracy opens up the battlefield for the disrupting tactics of the “Remoaners”. Is this how the establishment works?\nA Government Minister resigns and oh he is a lawyer. The High Court whilst resisting the urge to comment on “Brexit” none the less make it utterly problematic to negotiate without the interference of MP’s many of whom are pro remain and lawyers. Add to that the “yesterday’s men and women” in the House of Lords and you can see the UK has a major “democratic deficit”. The Lawyer who resigned did so we imagine so he could throw the full weight of his “Publicsectocratic” mind behind the Remain campaign in Parliament. Of course with a full battalion of Political lawyers the battle to frustrate Brexit will be much easier than winning the public over to the cause of remaining in the EU with its bloated army of technocrats and wafflers.\nWe said it here that the Establishment are largely comprised of politicised lawyers. It seems that we were more right on that that the evidence at the time suggested; we have some more compelling evidence now. The separation of powers, undermined by Blair and his army of subversive lawyers still holds the nation to ransom. And we can see where the counter-revolutionaries are on all sides of the House of Commons. Democracy in crisis: “hell yeah” the country is run by lawyers, not politicians!\n07.11.16 What happens when a “virtuous circle” consisting of establishment action to tackle the effects of economic decline goes wrong. You the workers pay to keep them in well paid work!\nThe trouble with the State getting too involved in things is that its chief box-wallahs find it difficult to put aside the levers of the state when the economy, perhaps due to an over-zealous enthusiasm to intervene fails to help the economy. They believe their intervention helps because it might have helped once when there was a less globalised operating environment for the world’s economies and you could spend value in a largely closed society and could feed your population internally. However, since then the world has opened up and jobs have gone elsewhere and people move about. There is still more of the world to open up too so things could only get worse for the blue collar workers. Unless dear revolutionaries we do something very creative.\nFirstly we need to look at what the “establishment” is up to. They are creating a State that provides the well-remunerated government and legal establishment employment that they and their “enlightened” and entitled class feel they deserve. The colonisation of the legislature by the legal establishment is part of this process. Knowing little about the people in the Blue Collar demographic the legal establishment and politicians of a certain stripe warmly virtue signal themselves by wrapping the idle and promiscuous in a welfare system that keeps them in ignorance, poverty, both spiritual and material, and idleness. It requires the actual grafters to pay for this and then pay for the army of well-paid box-wallahs who extract tax to pay for this wasteful system and of course, their 100k salaries too.\nWhat happens in this situation is that the workers become the victims of the “virtuous” State and we end up with the workers paying for a system that promotes the very values the workers detest but which critically keeps the establishment in work. The outcome at this elementary stage in the revolution is Brexit and possibly Trump. In the UK Theresa May may slowly let the steam out of the blue collar pressure cooker and get us out of the clutches of the rich tax gobbling and entitled EU waffler. If this doesn’t happen then things can only get a little tense and a Blue Revolution may be superseded by a more bloody red one.\nSo what is the answer; well why not make training Britain’s young in proper practical skills easier for the talented tradesman and women of the UK, whilst making it less attractive to employ “off the shelf” workers from Eastern Europe. This doesn’t have to be abusive, simply a shift in focus away from bogus degrees and the student debt that supports “lefty” academics. We only have about a decade left to do this because we still have talented and skilled people left to do the training. This approach will embed workers values rather than the values which demand that the tax payers job is to support the “left” elite.\nSecondly and more importantly open up Britain to the intellectual talent of the Indian sub-Continent and beyond as we hope Mrs May is trying to do. So rather than replace young trainee brickies with Eastern European brickies we can replace the overpaid and entitled elite with a more modest cleverer and moral group of intellectuals from elsewhere in the English-speaking world…..Come on let’s give the establishment elite a taste of their own medicine, at least until Grammar schools deliver our own competitive working class elite. Let’s replace some of our public School elite with skilled and talented migrants. What’s good for Britain is good for the world! It’s been like that since the 18th century!\n09.11.16 Well well Trump won. No real surprise there we supported him too! But to avoid a real mess he has to deliver. We offer some advice!\nThe Trump challenge is to deliver to the constituency of the white working and middle classes who feel that the last three decades have been about undermining their economic status by exporting their jobs; then expecting them to burden themselves with debt to keep each other in work whilst the political elite skims off a little for themselves through the taxation on the debt based profits. In many ways, Trump is a challenge to the “Publicsectocracy” he is not part of the political elite, although we would argue that, in reality, he is a beneficiary of what we call debtamorphosis. His empire has a value a fraction of what it is claimed it is worth a fact he needs to accept, but it has the “worth” it has, because of debt based asset price inflation.\nHowever, there are some words of caution. His spending programme will indebt the USA to an extent greater than Clinton. However where they would spend the money on education and keeping the candle of the liberal establishment a light he will build things and invest in blue collar work but the outcome will not in a globalised world generate the endogenous growth envisaged. The Money will simply flood abroad.\nIn the end, however, Trump’s biggest challenge will be to deliver to the constituency who elected him. A constituency who will expect a quick fix for their alienation and low wages. His context is a country of mass ignorance, of sad embittered people who feel angry; scarily he needs to meet the needs of these people. He has thankfully done on behalf of the public what was needed in respect of the elite. We need less of the expert and the elite and certainly, they need less pay. However, only half of what a Blue Revolution wanted is knocking the elite. Having achieved this he has also to deliver work, wages and the American dream to the alienated masses. Donald, you are like a dog chasing a fast moving car…….however you are the dog who has caught up and has the car clamped between its jaws, what are you going to do with it.\n12.11.16 To the left leaning liberal elite “Populism” becomes fascism. Their hostility however is simply a fear that the “blue Collar” masses will challenge their now faltering social and economic model\nThe word populism isn’t used to explain Clinton winning the “popular vote” but it has been antagonisingly used to explain the upsurge in the “deplorable” vote. Somehow people voting on mass for Clinton is seen as demonstrably different from people voting on mass for Trump. This Trump Blue Revolution is seen as appalling and frightening in equal measure but for us, the worst case scenario would have been the return of Clinton voted for by the smug self-satisfied the brainwashed and downright mislead. The vast majority of Clinton supporters are brainwashed into thinking the Clinton’s “socioeconomic” model has a sustainable future, will deliver for ordinary Americans and will lead to more social justice. On all counts, we disagree emphatically. More of the same debamorphosis, funnelling tax and debt based revenue into the pockets of the elite with the overspill generously handed out to the poor as a form of virtue signalling and all delivered on an industrial scale. The mob of hucksters in the upper reaches of the US political system can’t believe that they have finally been rumbled. Clinton is probably no criminal unless ensuring you do nicely from the tax payer and public sector and big business is a criminal rather than a moral offence.\nOne small additional point we wish to emphasise is that the populism on both sides of the Trump Clinton divide is very much due to Constituency marketing. The Clinton’s went for the economically illiterate but socially aware young, the lower ranks of the publicsectocracy and the wealthy but guilty (similar to the UK’s Champagne socialists) whilst the Trump campaign went for the exact opposite. Both camps, however, miss the essential point about the tensions between their campaigns. People want to see change; the politicians gave them meat they could recognise from their polarised vantage points which achieved the result of getting Trump elected and the popular vote going to Clinton. However, most ordinary Americans (and Brits) are divided on the basis of criteria which is perhaps intended to miss their common interests.\nWhat are these common interests? The real issues that were lost in the polarisation of an angry and vexatious campaign and which clearly need sorting out if a true Blue Revolution is to energise more than about half the population. Regrettably so far only the half who are angry about knowing they have lost out, rather than those who have been seduced by the rhetoric and do not yet know they are actually losing out as well…..they just don’t know it yet. So who are those who are suffering from an “unknown known”? We go in search of the lost constituency of working class voters.\nThe most obvious group are the students. Rightly fed a diet of socially progressive ideals; tolerance to difference etc but at the same time led to believe that these progressive ideas is political as opposed to economic. The free market demands “diversity” let us be honest the marketisation of sex is driven by economics, not politics. We don’t see Hilary Clinton saying “market your genitals”. No, it is a product of economics as so is Gay Marriage, Gay rights, transgendered rights and free movement. Capitalism’s Contract Choice and Consent. To see this as purely political and therefore Clinton’s unique selling point is stupid. Trump may have appealed to blue collar workers and “red necks” but we are certain he has no negative views on most of the above.\nStudents are particularly vulnerable to liberal bull-shit. They get indebted to keep left liberals in well renumerated “academic” work. Work that is unwilling to stray into “sociological” areas that have been vacated by “lefties” since most of the numbers show they are totally wrong about everything social; immigration, big government, family life, religion, contract choice and consent no less. If students thought about their student debt and stopped obsessing about rights, they might see that the biggest threat to their long-term future is the liberal left.\nThe next big constituency is the low ranking members of the Publicsectocracy. These people think that their wages terms and conditions are safeguarded by the state. They are not. The bottom of the public sector is not protected by the top echelons of the state. The top echelons look after themselves first and the tactical end of things end up penalised and privatised. The issues that the top publicsectorcrats cite to the lower order as reasons to be “progressive” are economic rather than political, see above. Yet the economics they promote militate against the lower orders. Most notably unemployment due to immigration, high house prices due to immigration. This con trick that progressive politics is all down to the liberal left is rubbish. People want freedom, contract choice and consent and the liberal left offer the expensive, privileged and inefficient state and then more of the same. Ordinary people should see Trump and Brexit as not about restricting the freedom to be yourself but as liberating people economically from the power of the state; the Brexiteers and Trump supporters should be joined by a young constituency of people who share progressive values and yet see that currently, the power of the State can only deliver debt and unemployment for those who are not part of the elite i.e. 99.7 % of us.\n16.11.16 The dislocation of the State from the people is a symptom of an age old process of evolution. However this time it is the “liberal” state that is thwarting progress!\nDonald Trump, Brexit and the “populism” in Europe and elsewhere is likely to erupt all over the liberal elite. Or as we prefer to call them the illiberal elite. We have been scratching our heads trying to offer a practical application to illustrate why the old ways of doing things are resistant to change whilst the public knows that the western social and economic model fails the “sniff test” and needs to evolve. We had a rather interesting paper sent through to us which we think can illustrate the contradictions between the state and the people and it is concerned with the British criminal justice system. Reading it some people might have to rise above their impulsive anger but if one clears one’s mind of prejudice and tries to actively avoid making too many pre-judgements and assumptions it does open up a fertile area for debate which we think contributes a lot to understanding why the west is in the mess it is in with its general public knowing something is wrong but perhaps not why.\nSo here goes. The criminal justice system has many characteristics which have been carried over from the medieval period. The Judge dispensing justice on behalf of the monarch reflects the systems feudal origins. In the US with no monarch, the term “the people” is used but it is not clear to what extent the interests of the “people” are really considered within the US system. In the UK the be-wigged Judge elevated and enrobed was historically intended to install fear, the aim being to emphasise the awesome power of the state in a visible way intended to intimidate an illiterate “mob”. The point is clear the state needed to emphasise its power and it’s “objectivity” as it dealt with the condemned, intent on breaking them physically and mentally before their eventual and very public destruction.\nBack in those days, the State was the name given to the business of exercising powerful vested interests; the King, the aristocracy and those in lower capacities who relied on the state’s largesse. In constant fear of the mob, justice had to be brutal. Whilst by modern standards this might seem appalling, the system was “just” as if there were a revolution the system that would replace the state would be no less and possibly even more brutal than that overthrown. This was the era of retribution and deterrence. It was an unforgiving system and perhaps reflects the west’s naivety in getting embroiled in regime change in the Middle East!\nBetween the 18th and the early part of the 20th-century things were transforming, as merchants and then industrialists became the vested interests determining the nature of the then modern state. The criminal justice system began to reflect these changes eventually losing some of the brutality as more “industrial” and “scientific” methods were introduced. However whilst the criminal justice system overall might have evolved (with penal policy introducing concepts of reform and then rehabilitation) the courts remained the visible pinnacle of state power, the power over life and death for what was still seen as a largely unpredictable and illiterate mob.\nEven the low crime rate which preceded the first world war was insufficient to shift the notion that the State was under constant threat from a revolutionary mob. There were of course threats, but being realistic they were not existential threats to the nation-state. The state, unwilling to change how it presented itself to the masses, continued to offer an awesome spectacle in court, of bewigged and robed judges and officials dispensing the power of the state with the intent of breaking the miscreant and sending a clear warning to others. Whilst reform and rehabilitation were entering the criminal justice process driven by reformers who were able to distribute capitalism’s wealth benignly, the operation of the courts remained resolutely medieval in character, and so it is today. However, today we don’t have an illiterate ‘mob’ and who exactly are the vested interests shaping the nature of the State and it’s institutions of power and authority such as the courts?\nWell, ‘capitalism’ has given way to the ‘free market’ which unlike capitalism, is an utterly amoral system easily ‘gamed’ by anyone with the money and ability to work out how to best fulfil their own selfish financial interests. Capitalism had its faults, but on the plus side, it created unprecedented amounts of wealth sufficient to reform society and lifted people out of poverty into work and in so doing conferred rights like contract choice and consent. The people who benefited the most were those who previously had been enslaved and powerless, the human property of the feudal state.\nThe ‘free market’ however has only one significant legacy. The legacy of debt pursuing immoral behaviour. Whilst people are now free thanks to capitalism they are also indebted. An indebted, as oppose to illiterate ‘mob’. Whilst still possessing and dispensing power the state like the individual consumer is reliant on debt to enable it to pay for its institutions of power and authority. There is no longer productive western ‘capitalism’ funding benign developments in the capitalist systems interests.\nThe courts, community sentences and prisons come in for critical evaluation within this debt reliant economic context. The courts and prisons are for most people the most visible manifestations of state power, however, they punish the same group of individuals who fund them; the indebted ‘mob’\nbetter known as the general public. This is why the system fails the public’s ‘sniff test’. The public is feeding the system with wrongdoers and the public is funding the system with taxpayers money, the only people who benefit from the modern criminal justice system are those whose salaries are paid for by it. Can this contradiction be resolved?\nSo in summary, we have an economic system which is dependent on debt and a state which relies on mass indebtedness with it’s associated immorality to pay for its institutions of power and authority. As for the criminal justice system, it punishes the same group of people who pay for it through their debt and taxation. Those unfortunate enough to find themselves managed by the criminal justice system are those who are the weakest in this perverse debt based economic model; their behaviour being shaped either by indebtedness or the conspicuous lack of public morality. They are the victims of this immoral system and they are punished by it too.\nThe Courts\nThe British criminal and civil justice systems act as though the early 21st century is the same as the mid-nineteenth century, with the full power of capitalism’s productivity driving the engine of economic and social growth at home and within the empire. Thus the justice system reflects the fact that it believes it is operating in the name of a vested interest and that this vested interest has a different set of demands and expectations from the public, a public from whom they are artificially differentiated. The old tactics of be-wigging, robes, titles and elevation continue to reflect this differentiation, just as it always has done. These practices are a direct link back to the days of the feudal system and thus are at odds with what people actually feel about themselves and their “he who pays the piper calls the tune” relationship to the state and its institutions and powers. Whilst the public are not perceived as a revolutionary mob when they enter the court system, they are treated like one and yet….. it is the public who are in reality now the ‘vested interest’ who pay for this system and the army of staffers and officers who run it.\nThe criminal justice system works on a “just deserts” model. So much punishment, for so much crime! However, there is something wrong with a system that costs the general public billions of pounds, promotes tax indebtedness and operated in a society which exposes the most vulnerable to a corrosive lack of collective morality (divorce, children being raised by the state, widespread sexual freedom or rather an absence of sexual restraint; the commoditization of everything including people).The state and therefore the courts should be representing the interests of the people but in absence of the public being viewed as a legitimate vested interest, the state acts to represent its own interests and in so doing separates its self from the will of the people. We would argue that this is what lies behind the failure of western governments to garner more than 50% public support. This is why ‘the system’ fails the publics ‘sniff test’.\nIf the power of the courts were to be used to reflect the vested interests of the general public who unlike big business actually pay their taxes, then the public would we think demand that a number of things should change. We would guess that there would be demand for the legal profession to be reformed and the roles duplicative roles of Queens Counsel, Junior Barristers and Solicitors modified to create a simple career structure. Justice could be affordable for the workers as of course, it should be.\nSecondly, the notion of Just Deserts fails spectacularly when it is both the public who pay for the just deserts and yet provide the cannon fodder for the “just deserts” system. In reality, who really has their interests served when an 80-year-old sex offender is sent to prison for 8 years at a cost to the taxpayer of three thousand pounds per week? If they understood the system, the public would not demand “Just Deserts” as defined by the state system, they would demand “Justice” and that would mean an affordable “no more harm” approach to sentencing and punishment. More liberal and progressive perhaps than state-sponsored liberal elite!\nA thirty-foot prison wall is not always necessary to deliver “Just Deserts” or prevent “no more harm”, likewise, some cases serially re-offend and just deserts lets them continue re-offending by passing short meaningless custodial sentences. It fails the “sniff test”. This just deserts model does, however, deliver incomes and salaries to a vast array of state workers. thankfully we believe there is not too much reform required. However, the impact of the two changes described above would be catastrophic for the people who currently act “legitimately” as the only vested interest currently recognised within the system; namely the vested interest of the politicians, officials and lawyers of the state.\nCommunity Sentences\nThese owe their existence to a belief at the turn of the capitalist 20th century, that people were not only capable of reform, but they wanted to reform. Back then the culture of the western world was simple, protestant and monogamous. There was, therefore, a simple template against which all could be measured. Capitalism needed sober healthy hard working workers so invested in criminal justice believing that personal reform was not only desirable but also possible. Thus the long march towards the current array of community sentences was started. Today there are numerous interventions and initiatives all paid for by the general public who often feel the efforts to reform are a waste of money and simply create more opportunities to re-offend. Again failing the “sniff test”. The just deserts concept militates against the public’s safety and Queens Peace by keeping the low seriousness, nuisance individuals out of custody. If the criminal justice system was invested with the public’s interest as it was of the capitalists, it would demand that community punishments should be better targetted to those who would genuinely benefit from them. They would not be available for those who due to weakness, stupidity or narcissism feel no need to improve their self-management and reduce the risk they pose to others. For this group, prison is probably the answer.\nPrison\nWe began by looking at the aims of sentencing as it has evolved over the last hundred years: retribution, deterrence and more recently reform and rehabilitation have come to define the role of prison and punishment within a just deserts model. The problem, however, is that prison and punishment do not deliver deterrence, reform or rehabilitation. Prison does not deter or rehabilitate, it is a home from home for too many damaged and inadequate victims of the free market. Men and women who stumble from one social and emotional crisis to the next. The lack of any collective morality permits the system to get away with exercising little if any real influence as they lock people up for a month sometimes a week at a time.\nTo overcome some of these obvious shortcomings just deserts needs to reflect the vested interests of the general public as oppose to the vested interests of the system itself. Those who can be in the community and be made safe should be in the community and made safe, even if it appears to offend the principle of just deserts. After all, just deserts was in the past paid for by a productive capitalist economy. With the now largely broken free market economy and indebted public paying for the system, justice needs to be redefined to make it affordable, effective and defensible.\nSo bringing these threads together, the answer seems to us be some reform of the whole system of justice. Prisons should be used to house those serial offenders and dangerous people who are incapable of managing in the community, irrespective of just deserts, whilst others could gain their just deserts in the community. Just deserts in this latter sense would be delivered by a combination of tracking, tagging, monitoring, curfews, exclusions, loss of passport, driving licence etc; a very punishing regime indeed fulfilling just-deserts at very little cost to the indebted taxpayer.\nSo what is the point of all this? Well, in summary, the Criminal Justice System like all state institutions no longer represents an elite who are responsible for paying for it. The wealth held by rich individuals today is not created by productive “capitalist” type activity it is generally debt based and in addition the wealthy are first in the queue for tax avoidance. So with no wealthy elite paying for the state and getting influence as a result, the state which comprises politicians and lawyers serve their own political and legal interests. The state does not serve the people who pay for it; namely, the blue collar workers and this is why we believe we are getting the Brexit and Trump phenomenon. The disconnect comes from the public not getting the influence they deserve as they are seen by the state elite as merely the people who pay to keep the state serving itself!!! Reversing this is the stuff of a Blue Revolution.\n21.11.16 When there is a global crisis what makes “Tone” think the ordinary man and woman will value his “contribution” particularly to something like Brexit? Sometimes we ask the obvious questions.\nBoring !\n22.11.16 Why are the liberal elite, “elite”? Because they are the top end of the State of course.\nWe have explored the anatomy of the western world’s anomie and we believe that the existence of this goes some way to explaining the success of the populism of Trump and Brexit campaigns. We have enlarged on this theme and we have argued that unlike the past when the “state” promoted the vested interests of powerful economic interests it shies away from reflecting the interests of the public who pay for it and prefers instead to concern itself with ts own interests. Hence we have welfare that has gone mad, a belief that the twin blights of a housing shortage and homelessness are the sole responsibility of government to cure and that correcting every illness from body dysmorphia and infertility to gender realignment and obesity is the responsibility of the state to fund. This creeping over-reliance on the state keeps the liberal elite in well-paid occupations and enjoying “career progression” whilst directing the thoughts of those responsible for paying for it towards the virtuousness of their benevolence. This is socialism. Socialism is expensive and ultimately by the state adopting a passive response towards “mission creep” the public pay for a system that is both expensive and inefficient. Socialism is essentially the “state” doing stuff it wants to do and with no actual contract with the state the public pick up the tab whether they want to or not.\nThe power to guide the activities of the state is what the liberal “elite” are for. We the ordinary person in the street have no say over the state and what it gets up to. So as our last contributor but one suggested we have a criminal Justice System which obsessed with “just deserts” and with prison as the ultimate penalty, regularly exposes the public to the horror of urban crime whilst “manageable” risks end up languishing behind a wall at a cost of thousands per week. The public would want justice and this means protection from harm, not retribution or deterrence those feudal ideas that belong to hell holes like Saudi Arabia.\nAs it is with criminal justice so it is with health and housing. People have become ignorant of the fact that a country has to pay its way and thus the combination of welfare induced social and moral decay (all too evident in too many parts of the western world), naive post-war expectations and health and housing stock asymmetries combine to ensure that the root cause of problems is refashioned to ensure the creeping role of the state is maintained. It is all too evident to us that a good measure of a country’s moral, social and economic health is to gauge how many “middle class” people are in the pay of the state. In the Uk for example if you discounted the state workers above tactical and operational grades there would be a very small “middle class” indeed.\nWould a small middle class be a bad thing or a good thing? Well, the state provides the influential well-paid work for the liberal elite and without the state doing what it does many would be out of work. On the other hand, the public is paying a lot for their state and would be better off with some shrinkage. It is of course, possible to conceive of a state that through the proper contracting arrangement with the public could offer real policy choice and government by consent thus avoiding the “Trump effect”. This rather than the liberal elite’s view that it illiberal not to have an ever encroaching “benign” and informed state to help and guide when needed.\nJust like the debt-laden free market which games the economic system to ensure that it looks after its interests (corporations, banks and markets in the main) so the state and its elite, our state and “our” elite does what it believes is right for us, whilst we the tax payers pay for their pleasure whilst impotently standing by and watching them **** it up.\n25.11.16 Ok Blair, Clagg et al are clearly “counter revolutionary”. What should be the response of a peaceful revolution ?\nWe opted not to examine Blair’s offer to assist Britain with Brexit on the basis that the question of his motive was too obvious to require addressing. Blair is a narcissistic and delusional god complex nut case in the mould of David Ike. However, bonkers or not, he draws in a number of others, all fellow travellers amongst the liberal elite who seem to be scheming to derail Brexit. The view of these people is that the British public are too stupid to know what is best for them and that we need to be guided like children by our masters and betters.\nThe problem with the Blair model as we point out incessantly, is that it is a continuation of the socialist triumph of the state over the individual. This model, necessary after the last war in Europe has over reached and now finances an immoral system which in any period including this one is utterly unaffordable and unsustainable in the long term. However, it is a business model that makes the senior officers of the state and business people who can game the free market very wealthy. This is the EU model and Blair and co do very nicely thank you. The problem, which isn’t being discussed is that this model will eventually collapse under the weight of its unsustainable contradictions. What are these contradictions? Well, public debt is engorged by mass migration, but that translates as a positive figure in the minds of the “Remain” crew making us the “fifth largest economy in the world”. We borrow and spend and it makes our economy look healthy just like with the compulsive borrower and gambler all this stops eventually. Within an economy mass migration is a bit like a drug ; it forces the government to spend money and spending on migration like spending money on drugs makes the economy feel good and look good…. short term. But long term it has to stop often as a result of some kind of paralysis caused by the simple unaffordability of the model.\nHousing inflation feels good to those with houses but locks people out of the housing market; both as tenants and owner occupiers. Migration probably creates the largest push factor on housing (along with divorce) particularly inner city housing; driving up rent values and creating an out of town demand for “new build”. So Brexit might reduce the pressure on housing and the loss of government spending and a reduction in housing inflation will translate into a slowing economy. However long term this is sustainable and is indeed beneficial. The same goes for the devaluation of the pound. We are once again getting a sense of the British economy based on real economics not the distorting filter of Euronomics!\nWage levels are in the short term going to be driven to the minimum wage by continuing immigration. Restrict migration to only those economic elites we need in the economy (as opposed to political elites that we need fewer of) and we will probably see wages rising at the lower wage levels. Wage levels being stagnant isn’t due to Brexit it is because we remain within the EU. Out of the EU and with a global approach to recruiting the brightest and best, our economy will benefit from global talent at the top whilst our flexible private housing market and welfare reform deliver British workers to British working class jobs at the delivery end of the economy.\nWhy would Blair and co want to avoid this obvious good news story? Well as part of the EU elite Blair and co have a perverse attachment to a government model that offers people like them (and their families) well paid but essentially pointless jobs managing the people of a continent. The people of the EU are getting wise to the fact that these elite Euro jobs are largely irrelevant whilst working class jobs are under threat from migration and over regulation. But more importantly their taxes and debt pay for a system that looks sustainable in the short term but that will eventually collapse taking them down whilst the elite takes their “earnings” paid by workers taxes and move to Dubi or similar.\nIf Blair and Co loved Britain as much as they loved Brussels they would applaud Brexit and the life-affirming opportunities it gives Britain to escape the debt-burdened incoherence of the EU. Leaving the EU (hard or soft) will help other nations develop a sustainable economy that through trade brings the chance of greater peace across the planet. It will help Britain recover from the consequences of its numerous recessions and help it begin to repay its indebtedness. Free trade is the DNA of European and world peace but regrettably for Britain and us at a Blue Revolution the EU seem intent on preventing Britain from having free trade within the EU customs area. Denial of free trade is a serious weapon the EU and their elites want to use against Britain. Blair and Co working in our interests? No, as usual, just their own!\n28.11.16 The trouble for girls is clear and simple; it’s the amoral free market stoopid!\nIs the western world a safe place for girls? It seems such an unnecessary question given that in Iran a girl can’t sing in public and in Saudi Arabia being female is almost a crime. We don’t need to look at Egypt or Somalia to register that in these countries being female is a risk to your reproductive health. So in the West, we would assume girls have never had it so good.\nThe West’s progress has ensured that the laws on marriage allow easy divorce, that girls can have jobs in every field of work, that the horror of pregnancy outside of marriage is mitigated by welfare and there is abortion on demand. With the consequences of this package of 20th-century reforms, girls should have a bright and aspirational future. However, the general opinion seems to be; girls in the West are unhappy and this is reflected in low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide.\nA recent British documentary highlighted the challenges for an Afghan girl as she fought to avoid being sold as a bride (to provide money for her brother) and her fight to be free to achieve her musical ambitions. She was throughout very philosophical; even when told by her grandmother she could be sold to an eighty-year-old. As a young Western girl, you might conclude OMG!\nHowever, OMG hardly captures the reality. Too many western girls behave with a level of self-loathing that would be understandable if they were being sold to an eighty-year-old. But why? Well we believe that girls in the West have lost part of one gender identity as full-time mothers and gained another partial identity as workers whilst being sold two myths; one is that the “free market” delivers happiness via mass consumption and that the tendency to objectify themselves and therefore others is due to them personally rather than a process encouraged by the free market to maximise consumption. This latter point is reflected in attempts to get girls to “get real” about themselves. The girls need to “get real” about the “free market”!!\nThe free market is a means of making money. Unlike in the past when making money was about creating jobs today the jobs are in China or India. This has elevated consumption above production as the main economic preoccupation. Consumption doesn’t require a working class it simply requires consumers and a means of creating enough wealth to provide the means of consumption (as opposed to the means of production). This wealth can be engineered by governments in the form of welfare spending or it can be “liberated” from increased asset values like house price increases. Whilst men and women are cast in the role of consumer (consumer having replaced subject or citizen) it seems to us that being a woman has added complication in that personal consumption can be increased by dint of one’s attractiveness or ability to be relaxed about getting pregnant whilst dependent upon state benefits.\nIn the past the two roles women could take advantage of were separated by marriage. Worker prior to marriage and mother thereafter. Today they are blended but the blending is simply intended to maximise the woman’s consumer capacity, so loyalty to others disappears for them as well as for men. For both males and females being with the rich man and marrying the beautiful woman is the corrosive aspiration downloaded into everyone at birth. In the case of men low wages exclude them from the mass consumer club, for women, average looks have the same effect. (an attractive woman can “trade up”) For both, debt can, in the short-term increase ones “consumption coefficient” but for women, the conflict between the two roles is mediated if not indeed manipulated by government policy, in particular, welfare. The problem for girls is that being conflicted around serious life choices is dispiriting, depressing and confusing and eventually it is too easy to default to having children; wanted or not!! thereby opting out of the world of work or being compromised with a work life balance that puts work before children.\nFinally, for too many men the alternative to being successful is suicide; physically removing themselves from the gene pool….often having sired a couple of children. The most recent figure show that suicide is the highest cause of death for men between twenty and thirty-four. For others, crime is another “alternative” career that creates a consumer capability.\nThe free market is not wholly a force for good it has the capacity to corrupt and distort peoples expectations, turning love, loyalty and duty into different forms of greed. The public feel this on both sides of the Atlantic but possibly don’t understand where the feeling comes from. However, the “free market” loving political elite neither feel nor understand the problems with this inhuman and corroding system and are therefore shocked when the public reject them because they won’t reform, modify or control this system.\n02.12.16 The Blue Revolution has some challenges which the “liberal elite” might find uncomfortable. Let us examine one!\nThe experts have just concluded that advice and education is a waste of time when it comes to controlling alcohol misuse and pricing policy is more effective. In this world of “rational expectations” does this help us to understand how best to create a nonreligious morality fit for the 21st century?\nSince the turn of the 20th century, there has been a slow relentless decline in moral behaviour. It has been met by an ever expanding system of welfare that the public sector elites view quite wrongly as “progressive”. How such a word can be used to justify a policy which undermines moral choices is hard to comprehend. Here at a Blue Revolution, we believe in Contract, Choice, and Consent and take the view that adults should be capable of navigating their lives within this moral framework with some limited scope for state support in the short term as necessary for individuals who fall on hard times. However with a western society grown fat and lazy on welfare and state largess something needs to be done to re-engineer society back to a place where adults are fully competent moral agents and not the beneficiaries of an undermining culture of state money and a sanctimonious moral relativism. The contract, Choice, and Consent should be all that is required to underpin a truly moral society. We are going to look at Contract, Choice, and Consent in relation to procreation.\nAt the time of the birth of Britain’s welfare state, society was moral to the point where too many personal choices were deemed immoral and in some cases like homosexuality illegal. This was both a dark age and an age of peculiar enlightenment. Christianity left a legacy of marriage by consent and those mature enough to understand the awesome obligations associated with marriage went on to provide loving stable and productive homes for themselves and their children. The element of choice and consent is there and the marriage ceremony itself is an “illiterates contract”. The persecution of gays and lesbians was and remains immoral. A person sexuality has no relevance to their social or economic productivity.\nUnfortunately, society changed, in some ways for the better but not in all ways. Something commonplace during the war but which lay dormant after the war began to filter into society and that was “sexual abandon”, a bi-product of war which became “sexual liberation” in the 1960’s. Sexual liberation was heralded by the “shagging” community as a way of marking themselves out from the more buttoned up or as they would argue repressed community. The sex scandals of the present age have their origins in this “sexual liberation”. It was and still is a predators charter.\nSexual liberation is bad enough when the consequences are hurt feelings, personal disgust, and divorce, but it significantly worse when a child is produced either because of “sexual liberation” or a child is caught in the middle of “sexually liberated parent(s).\nSo having exposed what we consider to be the problem; what do we see as the solution? Well, it can’t be more of the same, state money to subsidise wanton stupidity. No, if we have to consider the financial consequences of millions of selfish “liberated” life choices we might take the view that this liberation has to stop. to avoid behaving like some prig or moral dinosaur such as we find in dust bowl Islamic societies like Saudi Arabia we need to protect individual choices and respect an adult’s moral agency. Contract, Choice and Consent does this. But what of those who fail to behave like adults, the children of the age of sexual liberation for whom Contract, Choice and Consent are irrelevant concepts.\nWell, this is where we at a Blue Revolution become a little more draconian; because a society based on Contract Choice and Consent has to have a way of encouraging compliance with responsible behaviour and disincentivize morally poor behaviour. This is done by having a national policy of DNA registration. A pregnancy is no longer an act of one sided selfishness with the more vulnerable gender picking up the moral pieces and the social disapproval. The process should be based on consent and choice and a contract between the parents to support the child. In the absence of this being negotiated by free mature moral agents, the state should step in and force the parents, confirmed via DNA to support their offspring. If education doesn’t work for alcohol misuse why would we assume it would work for reckless procreation.\nThe “liberal elite” will argue that registering DNA is an infringement of human rights. That is because there is money to be made from the social and moral chaos upon which the state thrives. However just as all our rights are now contingent on fair play to all of us taxpayers, particularly now that the wealthy corporations have decided that tax avoidance is a moral imperative, knowing who has sired whom and therefore who should pay is essential to help re-motivate people towards improved moral behaviour. We would argue that this change will be a bitter pill for the underclass to swallow, but it will we guarantee….note guarantee, improve the lives and expectations of boys and girls, put promiscuity into retreat and place children as the pinnacle of a safe and coherent union between parents who have thought about children ahead of a promiscuous lifestyle. No punishing the fornicators, no sex education explaining what to do with your “farm parts” just a lesson in contract choice and consent and the consequences of having unprotected sex on your bank balance and future happiness and prosperity. Here at Blue Revolution, we consider that as sexual intercourse releases powerful hormones it is a bit like a drug. So let’s tackle its worst social aspects in the manner of substance misuse. Let’s treat it like a dangerous substance!\n04.12.16 What is wrong with “Remainers”? Their love of the State doesn’t stop with the EU that’s what!\nThe Lib Dems are claiming to have made a come back with electoral success based they say on a campaign which was largely anti Brexit. It is not clear to us why the sort of people who live in Richmond would be 70% in favour of “remain”. However, there are other “affluent” constituencies which also have a similar profile so perhaps it is about being affluent. Here at a Blue Revolution, we are well enough educated, and global in outlook but not affluent so unlike the affluent we can’t accept the idea of an expensive government over running our lives or accept the idea of rule by superstate.\nIn the twenty-first century, the superstate is essentially an arrangement which sees the little bit of non-debt backed value created by workers being consumed by the state, for the ultimate benefit of the state. The welfare, health and human rights industries to name but three are basically the use of ordinary people’s lives and tax revenues to justify extraordinary wages for the states army of workers. Perhaps Richmond is full of well-paid state workers (£100K+) and bankers who either don’t have to worry about business profitability as they are Civil Servants or think that flogging debt to almost bankrupt European’s contributes to sustainable long-term progress.\nThe problem these affluent people face is their inability to accept there is a democratic deficit in staying in the EU. Whilst getting out might look complicated…. the problem is no one gave the tax paying public the option of opting into the superstate, it was a choice made for us by the elite. So now with all the soft fascism the elite can muster (even in the UK’s Private Eye and the Lib Dems pro-EU posturing amongst others) we need to resist the elites continued pleading for us to stick with their grand plan. We also need to resist the ideas of a left alliance of Greens and the Lib Dems who think Labour will help them salvage what for Brexiteers is the nightmare of remaining. This as we said, is a scenario that the public didn’t vote for and did actually vote against.\nIn reality and with the power of technology the State needs to wither away (a bit….or a lot ) but holding on to control and power runs against the interests of the ordinary people who want less of the State and its cost, not more. With idiots like the putative left alliance having a tantrum all over the place about everything, the prospect of the state continuing to strut it’s wholly tax gobbling and all too often self-serving and pointless stuff, is certain. Brexit starts the process of change.\n07.12.16 We are the people, the people are not the State. The State should be the servant of the people but with an elite in charge the State is our master!\nWe have commented on the relationship between the people and the State in various posts over the last few months and particularly as we worked our way towards Brexit. Concepts like “vested interests” “the establishment” only have meaning when the State and the people do not share common values. We believe that under the economic system that was known as Capitalism the State operated in the interests of the Capitalist class. Upholding “capitalist values”. These reinforced inequality in wages and flowing from that limited the rights of the workers to enjoy the full freedoms afforded by Contract, Choice and Consent. This went as far as creating a lifestyle limited environment of poor health, ignorance and low expectations.\nThe post-war era accelerated the process of turning the capitalist system around. it achieved this by putting the State centre stage, no longer operating on behalf of the vested interests of the Capitalist system which many viewed as the cause of World War II. Post war the State became the operator of big businesses, welfare protected the workers and the Grammar Schools elevated the children of “workers” into the establishment. It was like the children’s books of the day presented it; a rosy era for the working class. Those of us who remember this period remember a time when people were generally happy responsible and the state seemed to work for the people.\nThe post-war period was not all good news, however. “The People” were all too often represented by a labour movement hell bent on destroying a system that had really ceased to exist in the west BY THE 1970’S. British firms were being turned into commissioning bodies manufacturing abroad. The horror of the capitalist system was now largely inflicted on the proletariat of China, Korea, Vietnam etc. The left wing put the final nails in the coffin of what remained of the British manufacturing and extractive industries because of their blinkered ideological ignorance they viewed “Industry” as capitalist, so it was necessary to destroy industry and the jobs that went with it.\nThe challenge is this; what do you do when your capitalist system is collapsing around your ears. When not- withstanding its many flaws it no longer delivers the value and wealth necessary to support consumption by an increasingly entitled population. Well, you recognise that “globalisation” has a different way of delivering wealth and you try and game it to your advantage. This is what the people see as the problem with the current system. It is also why the traditional “left” have no answers. The state manages wealth and much of this wealth is generated by the debt and tax of workers. Unable to countenance any suggestion of a return to “capitalism” the left just promotes the same Tax and spend model to maintain demand and consumer satisfaction.\nThe problem is that by replacing vast swathes of the economy (if you don’t believe this take any British county or city and work out how many people work for its biggest employers; the NHS, Schools, County and District councils plus the odd prison or MOD Base etc) the government is trapped into maintaining itself first and foremost, and then it looks to supporting the rest of the economic system. This is the mechanism by which the state becomes the master of the people. Protecting the States interests is the main purpose of the state and its army of pointless 100K+ “Senior Leaders”. The people get in the way of this “nice little earner” hence the hissy fits from Statists like Britains Nick Clegg and an assortment of the State elites in parliaments (EU, Westminster, Scottish, Welsh, NI Assembly) and their supporting administrations; “Civil Servants” and Courts.\nSo what is the solution? Well to coin a phrase the workers need to raise their consciousness. Not like some long haired student Marxist bamboozled by the complex nature of Marxism who believes that the State is the answer to the inequalities of the world, but by realising that the State keeps a lot of people on great salaries doing very little that matters to ordinary people and these State people are the elite who work the system to their long-term advantage. A sort of perpetuating of disadvantage by pretending or virtue signalling that they are doing the opposite.\nThe modern economy has so much government in it that it can be easily characterised as a system operated by the State that takes workers debt and tax and turns it into salaries for its self-selecting elite. People like Nick Clegg, Keir Starmer, the Kinnocks, Blairs, the Judges of the higher courts and an army of people who do stuff in our name but not with our consent!!\n07.12 16 An Industrial strategy needs a policy on debt and pensions. These are yesterday’s challenge tomorrow!\nAn industrial strategy needs to cover a number of issues in the now globalised world. We think that dwarfing energy prices and other global uncertainties are the problems of debt and pensions. How did we get here? The modern free market is not capitalism. Capitalism requires the accumulation of capital. This was appropriated from workers in the form of the profits made by underpaying the workers. In a capitalist system, this capital became the basis for future investment, economic growth and of course future exploitation of workers.\nAs we argue the capitalist system had its faults but it was the progenitor of what we now have come to recognise as the modern world. It reflected the troika of Contract, Choice and Consent which underpins freedom and democracy and it demanded of those subject to its discipline a responsible way of life that required people to take care of themselves and their families and to have regard for their communities. They had to work out how to manage the wages borne of the exploitation by the capitalist. With the combination of Contract, Choice and Consent and the responsible worker looking to protect their families the fundamental building blocks of freedom and democracy became well established by the 1930’s. They endured the war and after the war, the government looked at the exploitation of an exhausted nation and intervened. They intervened to rebuild the economy and to minimise the levels of the wage exploitation by capitalists. The government never assumed that the qualities self-discipline hard wired into people by the capitalist system would not endure with a more interventionist government programme. They assumed that with welfare and pensions, health and education the future for working people was bright. It was until the beginning of the 1960’s.\nIn the 1960’s the capitalist system largely morphed into the modern free market. This is an immoral system. It has no context of responsible behaviour underpinning it. It encourages irresponsible social and economic behaviour. The post-war legacy of welfare became the means by which the free market managed to rid itself of any responsibility for the social and economic decline of the nation whilst relying on the welfare system to maintain wages and pensions. Sending work abroad and bringing migrants here allows the price of labour to decline whilst sending the manufacturing industry abroad allows free market profits to remain high. Paying for it all with debt and taxation allows consumer demand to be kept up benefitting the svengalis of the free market, people like Sir Philip Green. This is an almighty mess!\nPensions in the public sector, health care costs and a whole host of other inflating expenditures is bringing the national finances under unbearable strain. We need to start making a profit as a nation and relying on the “free market” with its urge to make money at the taxpayer’s expense really is not going to make Britain a leading industrial nation.\n10.12.16 The elite and their experts are still intent on confusing the public about the reality of Brexit and the “old world order”. But why? We look to the Uk for answers.\nIn the UK it is claimed Brexit means Brexit. Well that is like saying Justice means Justice; it means very little but unintentionally for Mrs May it sends a mixed message to those voters who Mr and Mrs Clegg and their NBF’s, the Blairs, Keir Starmer et al view as too stupid to understand the complex issues associated with the UK departing the EU; namely most of the British people both Brexiteers and Remainers.\nThe elites look down on the British people in a way that was inconceivable in the past; this is whether the people agree with them or not. Is it amongst other things our ability to load our sentences with actual often difficult meaning rather than speak articulately and yet simultaneously say nothing? it is our ability to live lives with none of the “status” craved by D-list “Slebs” and the elite in the places that warehouse them like the Big Brother House, BBC, EU and Westminster? or is it even more elemental?\nThe reason for their disdain, and if you don’t know what we mean watch Emily Thornberry MP, is the fact that we are no longer essential “factors of production” within the British economy. Factors of production that have to be “heard”, respected and won over to maintain capitalism’s promise of creating social and economic value and tax revenue for the State. We “the people” are now just a means by which the government can manipulate the economy to maintain aggregate demand through tax, debt and welfare and thus secure for a little longer the free market merry-go-round that keeps them in their positions of rank and privilege and allows some people who game the system to get rich. This maintains the pretence that the economic system is “just” and laden with opportunity for all. The modern Economic System delivers little by way of social and economic “justice”. We call it “secular wWesternism” as it delivers unhappiness, misery and destruction of the planet (no not the myth of solely man-made global warming stoopid) on an industrial scale.\nAs usual with a Blue Revolution, there is a lot in the above. Let us identify some examples. Global warming is the global issue most promoted by the elite. It helps to take the public’s eye of the “secular western” ball. The problem with the world economy is that with debt as the basis for economic prosperity there needs to be a ravenous “growth” to repay debt, replenish pensions and maintain stock and property prices. This requires an attack on our beloved planet like no other, over-population, deforestation and the volume of extraction, pollution and species annihilation, and yet whilst the elite talk of progress i.e. economic success reducing poverty and global conflict etc, we say yes, but at what price! Can it be done in a more planet-friendly way?\nTo tackle this head on the “elites” would need to scale back their own activities and recalibrate the world economy to something more sustainable and for them scary too; something measurable and achievable, co-operation and non-conflict based. Unwilling to change the nature of the western hegemony they promote “man-made global warming”; and Kyoto, the secular western elite’s impotent proxy for actually doing something to save the planet. Oh and the so called “Greens” buy into this rot too, along with the “storm troopers” of the elite……the academic “expert”.\nTo save the planet we would need to cut the birth rate through women’s education and employment, restrain the gender obsessions upon which too much of the free market is built and which across all demographics promotes reckless single parenthood. We must establish some global and universal values; we offer contract, choice and consent and we must stop the free market merry-go-round of “growth at all costs” and then more growth. This means moving away from a debt based economic model with the state as ringmaster to one based on achieving high levels of non-debt-based social and economic value by for example opening up Africa to agri-trade whilst restraining population movements by encouraging sustainable, non-growth obsessed economies in countries that currently export people rather than productivity.\nOn the Uk domestic front, the elites won’t tell you that the British economy is so dependent on migration that it actually needs “free movement of people” i.e. the movement to the UK of whole families. We have argued that “free movement of workers” is “just” and fair. However, it is unlikely to deliver the crippling levels of migration that the state needs to inflate the housing, property, stock and welfare markets which just so happen to contribute to the UK’s economic “growth”.\nThere is growth out there Jim but not as we know it, and as Brexit showed, not as we like it.\nApols to “The Firm”.\nAll Faiths Page 3\n21.10.16 The political elite and their hangers on plus the underclass; two groups who are well beyond their sell by date.\nIf observing mankind’s evolution from the swamp to highly evolved but immoral and indebted teaches us anything it is that at almost every step of the way one small group is exploiting a much larger one. Whether it is the unacknowledged exploitation of women by men in tribal culture or a feudal system furnished with value by serfs or slaves history to date teaches us that we are only slowly falteringly or in Donald Trump’s case groping our way towards more enlightened times. The enlightenment is within eye and earshot but still not achievable yet. But Why?\nAs economic determinists, we believe that to fully realise a progressive evolutionary shift we need to understand where exploitation lays in the current economic system. We have, we hope explained that there are groups of influential people out there happily manufacturing industries that allow them to line their own pockets with government cash much of this government cash is debt based and paid for by the worker. The most significant of these groups are the ambulance chasing lawyers pursuing minor public sector and health workers plus soldiers for “compensation”. Alleged wrongdoing is the context for litigation. The compensation is the self-justifying pretext for court action but the much more important subtext are the legal costs!\nThe law-makers being lawyers is a breach of the separation of powers but one that the lawyers, that generally quite process observant group are quite happy to overlook. There is also the fact that the law is expected to pay well so lawmakers are paid well too. Lawyer as policy and lawmakers is one reason that the interests of blue collar workers have been overlooked for too long. Our needs are secondary to the needs of the State to protect its officers, members, and hangers-on and keep the whole process hidden by a veil of legal legitimacy . This explains the left alliances (Greens, Lib Dems and Labour Party in the UK’s obsession with staying in the EU). It is only very remotely about trade it is really about maintaining the EU political system for the benefit of the Junkers and Tusks and the UK’s “left-wing” hangers on and duff politicians . For their “class” to survive the EU has to survive. This makes what the UK did in voting out as cutting edge revolutionary as anywhere in the word for many, many decades; possibly even centuries. Well done. The Blue Collar revolution starts from here. The three millennia of rule by one elite after another will start to change from here on in.\nHowever, there is one element of UK domestic policy which we believe is exploitative and which also supports the State’s overall aim of maintaining control for its elites which justifies well-paid state employment at the highest level. And that is the subsidisation and growth of the underclass. This shameless bit of social engineering has cast millions of lives into a mire of hopelessness resulting for males in drug, alcohol and crime and women into premature motherhood before that are emotionally equipped to look after themselves let alone a small defenceless child. The advantage of this horribly broken system is that it allows the left wing parties to talk the language of caring whilst promoting a system which keeps workers paying and the state receiving and the underclass locked into a moral and economic “double lock” that allows them little chance of escape. The underclass feeds the State monster, directly through the need to manage them via government jobs and government departments such as the Justice department and indirectly by encouraging workers from abroad to migrate to do low skilled work, thus pleasing the EU overlords. Migration puts pressure on the housing market so housebuilders do Ok as does the Government via taxes on building and sale.\nWe believe the Blue Collar revolution, the proper worker’s revolution needs to tackle the problem of the exploitation of the worker’s root (the underclass) and branch (the elite)\n23.10.16 Contract, Choice and Consent; a Blue Revolution’s global “trideology” for the rest of the 21st and the 22nd century and beyond.\nThe “ideology” of the EU and we have recently concluded the “ideology” of “New Labour” (RIP) are similar in one specific respect; they are both premised on the belief that social justice can be delivered by a theological or ideological “socialist” state. Free movement of people, whole swathes of people, the very young, the very old and the disabled moved around the continent to access better welfare, education and health all on the “ticket” of often a single “worker”. This is the inception of the dream of the EU social and economic engineers; a continent united in one single belief system and one single market. However it is about 200 years too premature and on this basis, it will break before it can be made to work. The analogy we would use is that the EU theologians are trying to transplant an old established Oak tree rather than cultivate a sapling and take their time over it. They are killing the tree.\nThere are lots wrong with the EU….its currency trapping weak economies into an unsustainable economic model, the free movement of people stoking up resentment for reasons obvious to anyone other than the elite. The over inflation of economies within the Customs Area of the EU luring the illiterate and the morally immature from North Africa. The consequences of “hubristic humanitarianism” on vulnerable EU communities and women.\nSo what is to be done. Well, we believe that to unite the world to encourage growth, trade and reduce the risk of war we need to promote a set of ideas that have obvious moral appeal and to a wide and culturally diverse world, and hence we have distilled “Marxism” and produced a spirit of freedom captured in Contract, Choice and Consent, our “trideology”. These three rights are drawn from Capitalism and are a legacy of that economic model conferring rights that under feudalism were denied to too many people……in fact denied to all peoples.\nThe EU needs to realise that its policy of self-promotion is denying countries that need to develop a modern morality the opportunity to do so it is doing this by discouraging the cleansing of relationships associated with free trade. The EU is not a safe pair of hands and neither is the rest of the self-regarding and the self-promoted western world…and that includes the ideological “left” who see wealth rather than rights as the main objective of their “socialism”. Grow up guys!\n28.10.16 Saint Tone, a Patron Saint of the EU theocracy offers us advice on Brexit. He like they simply don’t get it!\nThe theocrats of the EU have dispatched one of their big guns to patronise and plead on behalf of the EU elite. On the UK’s BBC radio 4 morning show, Tony Blair dished up the usual meal of warmed up “third-way” leftovers and a defence of the EU status quo which confirmed the self-regarding, paranoid and delusional view of economics, politics and society that characterises much of the Remain side of debate.\nClearly, the British people didn’t know what they were doing in voting for Brexit and don’t know what they are doing in continuing to support Brexit. The implications are that much misery will befall them and they will have to rely on their elites to sort out the ensuing Brexit mess. It could not occur to Blair because he is incapable of self-criticism that the politically mature and independently minded British might be prepared to endure short-term problems in some economic areas such as lower house prices and increased inflation as a bi-product of gaining proper democratic accountability and a reduction in the power of the technocrats and the elite. Of course, it is arguable that much of what is going on in the economy is simply a correction ofter years of EU economic engineering. The British economy needs to start living in the real world; the world of risk, value, price and profit and loss. It needs to leave the safe haven of the Alice in Wonderland economics of Tusk, Junker, Schultz…..oh and Blair. This is a world where the Elite game the economy to meet the economic, political and sociological needs of the elite themselves and use the economic levers of mass migration, Quantitative Easing and low-interest rates to create artificial short term “confidence” and thereby maintain aggregate demand across a range of EU strategic sectors. Of course, the beneficiaries of this “economic model” are the elite who fob the masses off with cheap debt and a morally ambiguous liberal social policy. All of this combines to create a long-term toxic blend of expectations and entitlements that the European economy can only hope to deliver in the short to medium term and will fail to deliver in the long term. They will fail because society will falter with too little collective social responsibility and economies will buckle under the strain of debt, ageing populations, mass migration and an absence of proper global competition keeping business sharp.\nWhat Blair et don’t understand because they are beneficiaries of the existing system is that economic value and progressive social values are longer being delivered by Western leaders in the western world. The British public have grasped this ahead of the rest of the EU and are the first to demand something is done about it; Brexit!\n29.10.16 If it were not for the ability to store value or transform debt into wealth would we be able to reveal and then solve the “puzzle of history”!\nIt was Karl Marx who said: “communism is the puzzle of history solved”. However, we have had almost one hundred years to become familiar with “communism” and it really hasn’t “solved”anything. The same goes for “socialism”; grand theories that eventually draw power to the state and thereby undermine society and an individual’s ability to fulfil their “species-essence”. So if everyone from Lenin to Corbyn has got it wrong what does “getting it right” look like. We consider whether the real workers Blue revolution solves history’s final puzzle, thereby bringing about the fabled “End of History”.\nWell firstly whether it is Communism or Socialism the actual application of the principles of both have been poorly interpreted. In the case of “socialism”, the State has shown a great reluctance to diminish its power and control and indeed under Blair in the UK and others around the world “the State” and its army of technocrats has grown as the power of western Capitalism has diminished. With Capitalism now unable to generate sufficient value to feed the workers the arms and legs of the state have stepped in to manage the operating environment of whatever bits of the productive and job-creating economy still remain active in the west. This is essentially managing the environment of the “free market” and ensuring that the real liquidity of the free market namely “confidence” is maintained. This has differed within the various parts of “the west”, but we would claim it is fair to say that the EU’s expansion was a stitch up by socialist technocrats intended to mitigate the effects of capitalism’s drift to cheaper areas of the world, and to ensure they and their class had a job for life. We call these people the “publicsectocracy”; they are the aristocracy of the “socialist system”.\nHas this socialist experiment of state management of the economic environment worked? Well, we would say yes and no. A state takes a lot of money to manage an economy and maintain the politics and social policy which rests upon it. In the UK there has been a programme of social policies since the end of WWII which could be described as progressive and the welfare state; a 19th-century idea now bloated and malfunctioning, was great in its time. Brexit proves however that overall model fails the public’s “sniff test”. Too much debt, too many pointless ” infrastructure projects”, too much immigration to fill up the city centres whilst the indigenous populations flee to the newly built out of town estates, family collapse and re-configuration driving housing demand along with the growing realisation that a worker’s right to a home will play second fiddle to the housing industry, lawyers and government, a government like all governments that needs tax revenue. Immigration, gaming the housing market in favour of builders, and the demand from family breakdown, all justifies what we call the mythology of the manufactured housing shortage. As if all that were not enough there is a moral decline as the free market “marketises” everything base including genitalia and sexual behaviour. What used to titillate older men, sooth the lonely and make schoolboys snigger is now part of the mainstream economy; it has to be, there isn’t as much of a real “value creating” economy left!\nSo overall, socialism has, like the political elite and the underclass it’s two great demographic creations, been around too long. Its army of highly paid functionaries and lawyers has become like the aristocrats of the old feudal system, unwilling or unable to see how they stand in the way of progress. So what of Communism?\nCommunism has never existed anywhere on the planet. The revolutions of the past were industrial revolutions orchestrated by the state which gave rise to rapid increases in the value the economy could create and thus gave a legitimacy to the claim higher living standards were due to “communism” as people became better off. This increase in value based wealth happened in the west under actual Capitalism. Some “Communist” or rather state capitalist societies like post-revolutionary Russia have finally settled back to become more “socialist” in character, rather more along western lines. This seems to us to be because socialism was or is what “communism” in Russia really was namely State control of the economic environment rather than by for and of the people! So in terms of solving the riddle of history, hmmm mmmm. More work to do.\n02.11.16 Trump and the White House yes or no? We endorse diversity so why shouldn’t a man with a personality disorder become President.\nAs revolutionaries, we accept that whilst revolutions in the 21st century should not be blood letting they might be gut wrenching. And so it will be with a Trump Presidency. Trump is clearly a man with one if not two personality disorders the most obvious being narcissism but with a bit of borderline thrown in too and perhaps some……..no we will stick to two. Anyway, we were debating Trump the other day and discussing the aftermath of a Trump win. It was suggested that the CIA might do him in, which whilst always possible in trigger-happy America seems unlikely.\nThe man is a revolutionary in that he has persuaded the sad, delusional and ill-informed that he stands up for them. Corbyn says the same thing in the United Kingdom and has attracted a similar constituency. However, whereas Corbyn’s natural supporters are the neurotic waifs and strays of the democratic process, Trump’s people are the gun toting and paranoid. His people hate the establishment, code word for the Clintons, as much as they fear the lawless underclass. They are sad and emotionally abandoned people though just like the lawless underclass they fear so much. As true apostles of the principles of diversity we at a Blue Revolution, however, fear no one including a President Trump; gut-wrenching as that prospect might be. Even a man with his obvious emotional shortcomings can be president in the 21st century; the US constitution almost shouts that at you as you pop out of the womb on US soil. But why do we think this way?\nWell Trump’s election as President will lead to a whole lot of soul searching as the US considers the implications of electing such an odd character to the highest office in the land, and what such a result will say to the world about the brash, money obsessed and shallow state of the American electorate as engineered, just like the UK’s not quite so lawless underclass, by a greedy and self-interested political elite. But that elite is the alternative.\nWe only had one word of caution about the election of President Trump and that was he has executive control of the codes to launch a nuclear attack. Apparently, these codes can be deployed without challenge by special advisers or military chiefs being used at the President’s discretion, causing a nuclear conflagration in fifteen minuted (four minutes to launch!).\nHowever as we have concluded that in a just world even someone as mad as Trump can be President, it doesn’t mean his special needs don’t deserve some special treatment. Therefore we recommend the appointment of the Presidential psychiatric team, who can quickly step in and deal with the US’s first President with “Special needs” and section him if required. Thus avoiding WWIII becomes a matter of his capacity for office rather than the failings of the US constitution. As our old friend Karl Marx said: “from each according to his ability to each according to his special needs”. With that proviso, we Blue Revolutionaries give a cautious thumbs up to President Trump.\nWith apologies to Karl Marx.\n03.11.16 Sharia courts in the UK! Is this really a problem? We consider the issue.\nSharia courts in the UK are accused of discriminating against women. Well, we consider the issue. Imagine a type of world where a person took responsibility for the decisions they make and were held to account. One might conclude that this is like the contract based western world where you agree to any arrangements you subject yourself to be it an employment contract or a personal loan. However when money is involved the T’s and C’s are usually rigidly enforced not so when the issue is about relationships. In the context of relationships, family life or the mundane humdrum stuff there is no direction or guidance in the west just a government willing to pick up the tab for people’s mistakes. People marry and divorce having children they can’t afford, conduct illicit relationships out of narcissism or a desire to hurt a no longer desired partner. A Sharia court only discriminates against people who have made informed decisions they now want to change. The critical question is; was the decision they made to start with, based on Contract, Choice and Consent?\nWell, the answer to this is quite simple. If the issue that is taken to the Sharia court was entered into willingly and there is no suggestion of abuse or coercion then the matter of the Sharia court is one of ensuring that people behave responsibly. We could do with a kind of Sharia court within the secular western world so we can start to tackle the blight of the irresponsible underclass.\n05.11.16 Uk’s High Court interferes with “Brexit”. The strategic wing of the publicsectocracy opens up the battlefield for the disrupting tactics of the “Remoaners”. Is this how the establishment works?\nA Government Minister resigns and oh he is a lawyer. The High Court whilst resisting the urge to comment on “Brexit” none the less make it utterly problematic to negotiate without the interference of MP’s many of whom are pro remain and lawyers. Add to that the “yesterday’s men and women” in the House of Lords and you can see the UK has a major “democratic deficit”. The Lawyer who resigned did so we imagine so he could throw the full weight of his “Publicsectocratic” mind behind the Remain campaign in Parliament. Of course with a full battalion of Political lawyers the battle to frustrate Brexit will be much easier than winning the public over to the cause of remaining in the EU with its bloated army of technocrats and wafflers.\nWe said it here that the Establishment are largely comprised of politicised lawyers. It seems that we were more right on that that the evidence at the time suggested; we have some more compelling evidence now. The separation of powers, undermined by Blair and his army of subversive lawyers still holds the nation to ransom. And we can see where the counter-revolutionaries are on all sides of the House of Commons. Democracy in crisis: “hell yeah” the country is run by lawyers, not politicians!\n07.11.16 What happens when a “virtuous circle” consisting of establishment action to tackle the effects of economic decline goes wrong. You the workers pay to keep them in well paid work!\nThe trouble with the State getting too involved in things is that its chief box-wallahs find it difficult to put aside the levers of the state when the economy, perhaps due to an over-zealous enthusiasm to intervene fails to help the economy. They believe their intervention helps because it might have helped once when there was a less globalised operating environment for the world’s economies and you could spend value in a largely closed society and could feed your population internally. However, since then the world has opened up and jobs have gone elsewhere and people move about. There is still more of the world to open up too so things could only get worse for the blue collar workers. Unless dear revolutionaries we do something very creative.\nFirstly we need to look at what the “establishment” is up to. They are creating a State that provides the well-remunerated government and legal establishment employment that they and their “enlightened” and entitled class feel they deserve. The colonisation of the legislature by the legal establishment is part of this process. Knowing little about the people in the Blue Collar demographic the legal establishment and politicians of a certain stripe warmly virtue signal themselves by wrapping the idle and promiscuous in a welfare system that keeps them in ignorance, poverty, both spiritual and material, and idleness. It requires the actual grafters to pay for this and then pay for the army of well-paid box-wallahs who extract tax to pay for this wasteful system and of course, their 100k salaries too.\nWhat happens in this situation is that the workers become the victims of the “virtuous” State and we end up with the workers paying for a system that promotes the very values the workers detest but which critically keeps the establishment in work. The outcome at this elementary stage in the revolution is Brexit and possibly Trump. In the UK Theresa May may slowly let the steam out of the blue collar pressure cooker and get us out of the clutches of the rich tax gobbling and entitled EU waffler. If this doesn’t happen then things can only get a little tense and a Blue Revolution may be superseded by a more bloody red one.\nSo what is the answer; well why not make training Britain’s young in proper practical skills easier for the talented tradesman and women of the UK, whilst making it less attractive to employ “off the shelf” workers from Eastern Europe. This doesn’t have to be abusive, simply a shift in focus away from bogus degrees and the student debt that supports “lefty” academics. We only have about a decade left to do this because we still have talented and skilled people left to do the training. This approach will embed workers values rather than the values which demand that the tax payers job is to support the “left” elite.\nSecondly and more importantly open up Britain to the intellectual talent of the Indian sub-Continent and beyond as we hope Mrs May is trying to do. So rather than replace young trainee brickies with Eastern European brickies we can replace the overpaid and entitled elite with a more modest cleverer and moral group of intellectuals from elsewhere in the English-speaking world…..Come on let’s give the establishment elite a taste of their own medicine, at least until Grammar schools deliver our own competitive working class elite. Let’s replace some of our public School elite with skilled and talented migrants. What’s good for Britain is good for the world! It’s been like that since the 18th century!\n09.11.16 Well well Trump won. No real surprise there we supported him too! But to avoid a real mess he has to deliver. We offer some advice!\nThe Trump challenge is to deliver to the constituency of the white working and middle classes who feel that the last three decades have been about undermining their economic status by exporting their jobs; then expecting them to burden themselves with debt to keep each other in work whilst the political elite skims off a little for themselves through the taxation on the debt based profits. In many ways, Trump is a challenge to the “Publicsectocracy” he is not part of the political elite, although we would argue that, in reality, he is a beneficiary of what we call debtamorphosis. His empire has a value a fraction of what it is claimed it is worth a fact he needs to accept, but it has the “worth” it has, because of debt based asset price inflation.\nHowever, there are some words of caution. His spending programme will indebt the USA to an extent greater than Clinton. However where they would spend the money on education and keeping the candle of the liberal establishment a light he will build things and invest in blue collar work but the outcome will not in a globalised world generate the endogenous growth envisaged. The Money will simply flood abroad.\nIn the end, however, Trump’s biggest challenge will be to deliver to the constituency who elected him. A constituency who will expect a quick fix for their alienation and low wages. His context is a country of mass ignorance, of sad embittered people who feel angry; scarily he needs to meet the needs of these people. He has thankfully done on behalf of the public what was needed in respect of the elite. We need less of the expert and the elite and certainly, they need less pay. However, only half of what a Blue Revolution wanted is knocking the elite. Having achieved this he has also to deliver work, wages and the American dream to the alienated masses. Donald, you are like a dog chasing a fast moving car…….however you are the dog who has caught up and has the car clamped between its jaws, what are you going to do with it.\n12.11.16 To the left leaning liberal elite “Populism” becomes fascism. Their hostility however is simply a fear that the “blue Collar” masses will challenge their now faltering social and economic model\nThe word populism isn’t used to explain Clinton winning the “popular vote” but it has been antagonisingly used to explain the upsurge in the “deplorable” vote. Somehow people voting on mass for Clinton is seen as demonstrably different from people voting on mass for Trump. This Trump Blue Revolution is seen as appalling and frightening in equal measure but for us, the worst case scenario would have been the return of Clinton voted for by the smug self-satisfied the brainwashed and downright mislead. The vast majority of Clinton supporters are brainwashed into thinking the Clinton’s “socioeconomic” model has a sustainable future, will deliver for ordinary Americans and will lead to more social justice. On all counts, we disagree emphatically. More of the same debamorphosis, funnelling tax and debt based revenue into the pockets of the elite with the overspill generously handed out to the poor as a form of virtue signalling and all delivered on an industrial scale. The mob of hucksters in the upper reaches of the US political system can’t believe that they have finally been rumbled. Clinton is probably no criminal unless ensuring you do nicely from the tax payer and public sector and big business is a criminal rather than a moral offence.\nOne small additional point we wish to emphasise is that the populism on both sides of the Trump Clinton divide is very much due to Constituency marketing. The Clinton’s went for the economically illiterate but socially aware young, the lower ranks of the publicsectocracy and the wealthy but guilty (similar to the UK’s Champagne socialists) whilst the Trump campaign went for the exact opposite. Both camps, however, miss the essential point about the tensions between their campaigns. People want to see change; the politicians gave them meat they could recognise from their polarised vantage points which achieved the result of getting Trump elected and the popular vote going to Clinton. However, most ordinary Americans (and Brits) are divided on the basis of criteria which is perhaps intended to miss their common interests.\nWhat are these common interests? The real issues that were lost in the polarisation of an angry and vexatious campaign and which clearly need sorting out if a true Blue Revolution is to energise more than about half the population. Regrettably so far only the half who are angry about knowing they have lost out, rather than those who have been seduced by the rhetoric and do not yet know they are actually losing out as well…..they just don’t know it yet. So who are those who are suffering from an “unknown known”? We go in search of the lost constituency of working class voters.\nThe most obvious group are the students. Rightly fed a diet of socially progressive ideals; tolerance to difference etc but at the same time led to believe that these progressive ideas is political as opposed to economic. The free market demands “diversity” let us be honest the marketisation of sex is driven by economics, not politics. We don’t see Hilary Clinton saying “market your genitals”. No, it is a product of economics as so is Gay Marriage, Gay rights, transgendered rights and free movement. Capitalism’s Contract Choice and Consent. To see this as purely political and therefore Clinton’s unique selling point is stupid. Trump may have appealed to blue collar workers and “red necks” but we are certain he has no negative views on most of the above.\nStudents are particularly vulnerable to liberal bull-shit. They get indebted to keep left liberals in well renumerated “academic” work. Work that is unwilling to stray into “sociological” areas that have been vacated by “lefties” since most of the numbers show they are totally wrong about everything social; immigration, big government, family life, religion, contract choice and consent no less. If students thought about their student debt and stopped obsessing about rights, they might see that the biggest threat to their long-term future is the liberal left.\nThe next big constituency is the low ranking members of the Publicsectocracy. These people think that their wages terms and conditions are safeguarded by the state. They are not. The bottom of the public sector is not protected by the top echelons of the state. The top echelons look after themselves first and the tactical end of things end up penalised and privatised. The issues that the top publicsectorcrats cite to the lower order as reasons to be “progressive” are economic rather than political, see above. Yet the economics they promote militate against the lower orders. Most notably unemployment due to immigration, high house prices due to immigration. This con trick that progressive politics is all down to the liberal left is rubbish. People want freedom, contract choice and consent and the liberal left offer the expensive, privileged and inefficient state and then more of the same. Ordinary people should see Trump and Brexit as not about restricting the freedom to be yourself but as liberating people economically from the power of the state; the Brexiteers and Trump supporters should be joined by a young constituency of people who share progressive values and yet see that currently, the power of the State can only deliver debt and unemployment for those who are not part of the elite i.e. 99.7 % of us.\n16.11.16 The dislocation of the State from the people is a symptom of an age old process of evolution. However this time it is the “liberal” state that is thwarting progress!\nDonald Trump, Brexit and the “populism” in Europe and elsewhere is likely to erupt all over the liberal elite. Or as we prefer to call them the illiberal elite. We have been scratching our heads trying to offer a practical application to illustrate why the old ways of doing things are resistant to change whilst the public knows that the western social and economic model fails the “sniff test” and needs to evolve. We had a rather interesting paper sent through to us which we think can illustrate the contradictions between the state and the people and it is concerned with the British criminal justice system. Reading it some people might have to rise above their impulsive anger but if one clears one’s mind of prejudice and tries to actively avoid making too many pre-judgements and assumptions it does open up a fertile area for debate which we think contributes a lot to understanding why the west is in the mess it is in with its general public knowing something is wrong but perhaps not why.\nSo here goes. The criminal justice system has many characteristics which have been carried over from the medieval period. The Judge dispensing justice on behalf of the monarch reflects the systems feudal origins. In the US with no monarch, the term “the people” is used but it is not clear to what extent the interests of the “people” are really considered within the US system. In the UK the be-wigged Judge elevated and enrobed was historically intended to install fear, the aim being to emphasise the awesome power of the state in a visible way intended to intimidate an illiterate “mob”. The point is clear the state needed to emphasise its power and it’s “objectivity” as it dealt with the condemned, intent on breaking them physically and mentally before their eventual and very public destruction.\nBack in those days, the State was the name given to the business of exercising powerful vested interests; the King, the aristocracy and those in lower capacities who relied on the state’s largesse. In constant fear of the mob, justice had to be brutal. Whilst by modern standards this might seem appalling, the system was “just” as if there were a revolution the system that would replace the state would be no less and possibly even more brutal than that overthrown. This was the era of retribution and deterrence. It was an unforgiving system and perhaps reflects the west’s naivety in getting embroiled in regime change in the Middle East!\nBetween the 18th and the early part of the 20th-century things were transforming, as merchants and then industrialists became the vested interests determining the nature of the then modern state. The criminal justice system began to reflect these changes eventually losing some of the brutality as more “industrial” and “scientific” methods were introduced. However whilst the criminal justice system overall might have evolved (with penal policy introducing concepts of reform and then rehabilitation) the courts remained the visible pinnacle of state power, the power over life and death for what was still seen as a largely unpredictable and illiterate mob.\nEven the low crime rate which preceded the first world war was insufficient to shift the notion that the State was under constant threat from a revolutionary mob. There were of course threats, but being realistic they were not existential threats to the nation-state. The state, unwilling to change how it presented itself to the masses, continued to offer an awesome spectacle in court, of bewigged and robed judges and officials dispensing the power of the state with the intent of breaking the miscreant and sending a clear warning to others. Whilst reform and rehabilitation were entering the criminal justice process driven by reformers who were able to distribute capitalism’s wealth benignly, the operation of the courts remained resolutely medieval in character, and so it is today. However, today we don’t have an illiterate ‘mob’ and who exactly are the vested interests shaping the nature of the State and it’s institutions of power and authority such as the courts?\nWell, ‘capitalism’ has given way to the ‘free market’ which unlike capitalism, is an utterly amoral system easily ‘gamed’ by anyone with the money and ability to work out how to best fulfil their own selfish financial interests. Capitalism had its faults, but on the plus side, it created unprecedented amounts of wealth sufficient to reform society and lifted people out of poverty into work and in so doing conferred rights like contract choice and consent. The people who benefited the most were those who previously had been enslaved and powerless, the human property of the feudal state.\nThe ‘free market’ however has only one significant legacy. The legacy of debt pursuing immoral behaviour. Whilst people are now free thanks to capitalism they are also indebted. An indebted, as oppose to illiterate ‘mob’. Whilst still possessing and dispensing power the state like the individual consumer is reliant on debt to enable it to pay for its institutions of power and authority. There is no longer productive western ‘capitalism’ funding benign developments in the capitalist systems interests.\nThe courts, community sentences and prisons come in for critical evaluation within this debt reliant economic context. The courts and prisons are for most people the most visible manifestations of state power, however, they punish the same group of individuals who fund them; the indebted ‘mob’\nbetter known as the general public. This is why the system fails the public’s ‘sniff test’. The public is feeding the system with wrongdoers and the public is funding the system with taxpayers money, the only people who benefit from the modern criminal justice system are those whose salaries are paid for by it. Can this contradiction be resolved?\nSo in summary, we have an economic system which is dependent on debt and a state which relies on mass indebtedness with it’s associated immorality to pay for its institutions of power and authority. As for the criminal justice system, it punishes the same group of people who pay for it through their debt and taxation. Those unfortunate enough to find themselves managed by the criminal justice system are those who are the weakest in this perverse debt based economic model; their behaviour being shaped either by indebtedness or the conspicuous lack of public morality. They are the victims of this immoral system and they are punished by it too.\nThe Courts\nThe British criminal and civil justice systems act as though the early 21st century is the same as the mid-nineteenth century, with the full power of capitalism’s productivity driving the engine of economic and social growth at home and within the empire. Thus the justice system reflects the fact that it believes it is operating in the name of a vested interest and that this vested interest has a different set of demands and expectations from the public, a public from whom they are artificially differentiated. The old tactics of be-wigging, robes, titles and elevation continue to reflect this differentiation, just as it always has done. These practices are a direct link back to the days of the feudal system and thus are at odds with what people actually feel about themselves and their “he who pays the piper calls the tune” relationship to the state and its institutions and powers. Whilst the public are not perceived as a revolutionary mob when they enter the court system, they are treated like one and yet….. it is the public who are in reality now the ‘vested interest’ who pay for this system and the army of staffers and officers who run it.\nThe criminal justice system works on a “just deserts” model. So much punishment, for so much crime! However, there is something wrong with a system that costs the general public billions of pounds, promotes tax indebtedness and operated in a society which exposes the most vulnerable to a corrosive lack of collective morality (divorce, children being raised by the state, widespread sexual freedom or rather an absence of sexual restraint; the commoditization of everything including people).The state and therefore the courts should be representing the interests of the people but in absence of the public being viewed as a legitimate vested interest, the state acts to represent its own interests and in so doing separates its self from the will of the people. We would argue that this is what lies behind the failure of western governments to garner more than 50% public support. This is why ‘the system’ fails the publics ‘sniff test’.\nIf the power of the courts were to be used to reflect the vested interests of the general public who unlike big business actually pay their taxes, then the public would we think demand that a number of things should change. We would guess that there would be demand for the legal profession to be reformed and the roles duplicative roles of Queens Counsel, Junior Barristers and Solicitors modified to create a simple career structure. Justice could be affordable for the workers as of course, it should be.\nSecondly, the notion of Just Deserts fails spectacularly when it is both the public who pay for the just deserts and yet provide the cannon fodder for the “just deserts” system. In reality, who really has their interests served when an 80-year-old sex offender is sent to prison for 8 years at a cost to the taxpayer of three thousand pounds per week? If they understood the system, the public would not demand “Just Deserts” as defined by the state system, they would demand “Justice” and that would mean an affordable “no more harm” approach to sentencing and punishment. More liberal and progressive perhaps than state-sponsored liberal elite!\nA thirty-foot prison wall is not always necessary to deliver “Just Deserts” or prevent “no more harm”, likewise, some cases serially re-offend and just deserts lets them continue re-offending by passing short meaningless custodial sentences. It fails the “sniff test”. This just deserts model does, however, deliver incomes and salaries to a vast array of state workers. thankfully we believe there is not too much reform required. However, the impact of the two changes described above would be catastrophic for the people who currently act “legitimately” as the only vested interest currently recognised within the system; namely the vested interest of the politicians, officials and lawyers of the state.\nCommunity Sentences\nThese owe their existence to a belief at the turn of the capitalist 20th century, that people were not only capable of reform, but they wanted to reform. Back then the culture of the western world was simple, protestant and monogamous. There was, therefore, a simple template against which all could be measured. Capitalism needed sober healthy hard working workers so invested in criminal justice believing that personal reform was not only desirable but also possible. Thus the long march towards the current array of community sentences was started. Today there are numerous interventions and initiatives all paid for by the general public who often feel the efforts to reform are a waste of money and simply create more opportunities to re-offend. Again failing the “sniff test”. The just deserts concept militates against the public’s safety and Queens Peace by keeping the low seriousness, nuisance individuals out of custody. If the criminal justice system was invested with the public’s interest as it was of the capitalists, it would demand that community punishments should be better targetted to those who would genuinely benefit from them. They would not be available for those who due to weakness, stupidity or narcissism feel no need to improve their self-management and reduce the risk they pose to others. For this group, prison is probably the answer.\nPrison\nWe began by looking at the aims of sentencing as it has evolved over the last hundred years: retribution, deterrence and more recently reform and rehabilitation have come to define the role of prison and punishment within a just deserts model. The problem, however, is that prison and punishment do not deliver deterrence, reform or rehabilitation. Prison does not deter or rehabilitate, it is a home from home for too many damaged and inadequate victims of the free market. Men and women who stumble from one social and emotional crisis to the next. The lack of any collective morality permits the system to get away with exercising little if any real influence as they lock people up for a month sometimes a week at a time.\nTo overcome some of these obvious shortcomings just deserts needs to reflect the vested interests of the general public as oppose to the vested interests of the system itself. Those who can be in the community and be made safe should be in the community and made safe, even if it appears to offend the principle of just deserts. After all, just deserts was in the past paid for by a productive capitalist economy. With the now largely broken free market economy and indebted public paying for the system, justice needs to be redefined to make it affordable, effective and defensible.\nSo bringing these threads together, the answer seems to us be some reform of the whole system of justice. Prisons should be used to house those serial offenders and dangerous people who are incapable of managing in the community, irrespective of just deserts, whilst others could gain their just deserts in the community. Just deserts in this latter sense would be delivered by a combination of tracking, tagging, monitoring, curfews, exclusions, loss of passport, driving licence etc; a very punishing regime indeed fulfilling just-deserts at very little cost to the indebted taxpayer.\nSo what is the point of all this? Well, in summary, the Criminal Justice System like all state institutions no longer represents an elite who are responsible for paying for it. The wealth held by rich individuals today is not created by productive “capitalist” type activity it is generally debt based and in addition the wealthy are first in the queue for tax avoidance. So with no wealthy elite paying for the state and getting influence as a result, the state which comprises politicians and lawyers serve their own political and legal interests. The state does not serve the people who pay for it; namely, the blue collar workers and this is why we believe we are getting the Brexit and Trump phenomenon. The disconnect comes from the public not getting the influence they deserve as they are seen by the state elite as merely the people who pay to keep the state serving itself!!! Reversing this is the stuff of a Blue Revolution.\n21.11.16 When there is a global crisis what makes “Tone” think the ordinary man and woman will value his “contribution” particularly to something like Brexit? Sometimes we ask the obvious questions.\nBoring !\n22.11.16 Why are the liberal elite, “elite”? Because they are the top end of the State of course.\nWe have explored the anatomy of the western world’s anomie and we believe that the existence of this goes some way to explaining the success of the populism of Trump and Brexit campaigns. We have enlarged on this theme and we have argued that unlike the past when the “state” promoted the vested interests of powerful economic interests it shies away from reflecting the interests of the public who pay for it and prefers instead to concern itself with ts own interests. Hence we have welfare that has gone mad, a belief that the twin blights of a housing shortage and homelessness are the sole responsibility of government to cure and that correcting every illness from body dysmorphia and infertility to gender realignment and obesity is the responsibility of the state to fund. This creeping over-reliance on the state keeps the liberal elite in well-paid occupations and enjoying “career progression” whilst directing the thoughts of those responsible for paying for it towards the virtuousness of their benevolence. This is socialism. Socialism is expensive and ultimately by the state adopting a passive response towards “mission creep” the public pay for a system that is both expensive and inefficient. Socialism is essentially the “state” doing stuff it wants to do and with no actual contract with the state the public pick up the tab whether they want to or not.\nThe power to guide the activities of the state is what the liberal “elite” are for. We the ordinary person in the street have no say over the state and what it gets up to. So as our last contributor but one suggested we have a criminal Justice System which obsessed with “just deserts” and with prison as the ultimate penalty, regularly exposes the public to the horror of urban crime whilst “manageable” risks end up languishing behind a wall at a cost of thousands per week. The public would want justice and this means protection from harm, not retribution or deterrence those feudal ideas that belong to hell holes like Saudi Arabia.\nAs it is with criminal justice so it is with health and housing. People have become ignorant of the fact that a country has to pay its way and thus the combination of welfare induced social and moral decay (all too evident in too many parts of the western world), naive post-war expectations and health and housing stock asymmetries combine to ensure that the root cause of problems is refashioned to ensure the creeping role of the state is maintained. It is all too evident to us that a good measure of a country’s moral, social and economic health is to gauge how many “middle class” people are in the pay of the state. In the Uk for example if you discounted the state workers above tactical and operational grades there would be a very small “middle class” indeed.\nWould a small middle class be a bad thing or a good thing? Well, the state provides the influential well-paid work for the liberal elite and without the state doing what it does many would be out of work. On the other hand, the public is paying a lot for their state and would be better off with some shrinkage. It is of course, possible to conceive of a state that through the proper contracting arrangement with the public could offer real policy choice and government by consent thus avoiding the “Trump effect”. This rather than the liberal elite’s view that it illiberal not to have an ever encroaching “benign” and informed state to help and guide when needed.\nJust like the debt-laden free market which games the economic system to ensure that it looks after its interests (corporations, banks and markets in the main) so the state and its elite, our state and “our” elite does what it believes is right for us, whilst we the tax payers pay for their pleasure whilst impotently standing by and watching them **** it up.\n25.11.16 Ok Blair, Clagg et al are clearly “counter revolutionary”. What should be the response of a peaceful revolution ?\nWe opted not to examine Blair’s offer to assist Britain with Brexit on the basis that the question of his motive was too obvious to require addressing. Blair is a narcissistic and delusional god complex nut case in the mould of David Ike. However, bonkers or not, he draws in a number of others, all fellow travellers amongst the liberal elite who seem to be scheming to derail Brexit. The view of these people is that the British public are too stupid to know what is best for them and that we need to be guided like children by our masters and betters.\nThe problem with the Blair model as we point out incessantly, is that it is a continuation of the socialist triumph of the state over the individual. This model, necessary after the last war in Europe has over reached and now finances an immoral system which in any period including this one is utterly unaffordable and unsustainable in the long term. However, it is a business model that makes the senior officers of the state and business people who can game the free market very wealthy. This is the EU model and Blair and co do very nicely thank you. The problem, which isn’t being discussed is that this model will eventually collapse under the weight of its unsustainable contradictions. What are these contradictions? Well, public debt is engorged by mass migration, but that translates as a positive figure in the minds of the “Remain” crew making us the “fifth largest economy in the world”. We borrow and spend and it makes our economy look healthy just like with the compulsive borrower and gambler all this stops eventually. Within an economy mass migration is a bit like a drug ; it forces the government to spend money and spending on migration like spending money on drugs makes the economy feel good and look good…. short term. But long term it has to stop often as a result of some kind of paralysis caused by the simple unaffordability of the model.\nHousing inflation feels good to those with houses but locks people out of the housing market; both as tenants and owner occupiers. Migration probably creates the largest push factor on housing (along with divorce) particularly inner city housing; driving up rent values and creating an out of town demand for “new build”. So Brexit might reduce the pressure on housing and the loss of government spending and a reduction in housing inflation will translate into a slowing economy. However long term this is sustainable and is indeed beneficial. The same goes for the devaluation of the pound. We are once again getting a sense of the British economy based on real economics not the distorting filter of Euronomics!\nWage levels are in the short term going to be driven to the minimum wage by continuing immigration. Restrict migration to only those economic elites we need in the economy (as opposed to political elites that we need fewer of) and we will probably see wages rising at the lower wage levels. Wage levels being stagnant isn’t due to Brexit it is because we remain within the EU. Out of the EU and with a global approach to recruiting the brightest and best, our economy will benefit from global talent at the top whilst our flexible private housing market and welfare reform deliver British workers to British working class jobs at the delivery end of the economy.\nWhy would Blair and co want to avoid this obvious good news story? Well as part of the EU elite Blair and co have a perverse attachment to a government model that offers people like them (and their families) well paid but essentially pointless jobs managing the people of a continent. The people of the EU are getting wise to the fact that these elite Euro jobs are largely irrelevant whilst working class jobs are under threat from migration and over regulation. But more importantly their taxes and debt pay for a system that looks sustainable in the short term but that will eventually collapse taking them down whilst the elite takes their “earnings” paid by workers taxes and move to Dubi or similar.\nIf Blair and Co loved Britain as much as they loved Brussels they would applaud Brexit and the life-affirming opportunities it gives Britain to escape the debt-burdened incoherence of the EU. Leaving the EU (hard or soft) will help other nations develop a sustainable economy that through trade brings the chance of greater peace across the planet. It will help Britain recover from the consequences of its numerous recessions and help it begin to repay its indebtedness. Free trade is the DNA of European and world peace but regrettably for Britain and us at a Blue Revolution the EU seem intent on preventing Britain from having free trade within the EU customs area. Denial of free trade is a serious weapon the EU and their elites want to use against Britain. Blair and Co working in our interests? No, as usual, just their own!\n28.11.16 The trouble for girls is clear and simple; it’s the amoral free market stoopid!\nIs the western world a safe place for girls? It seems such an unnecessary question given that in Iran a girl can’t sing in public and in Saudi Arabia being female is almost a crime. We don’t need to look at Egypt or Somalia to register that in these countries being female is a risk to your reproductive health. So in the West, we would assume girls have never had it so good.\nThe West’s progress has ensured that the laws on marriage allow easy divorce, that girls can have jobs in every field of work, that the horror of pregnancy outside of marriage is mitigated by welfare and there is abortion on demand. With the consequences of this package of 20th-century reforms, girls should have a bright and aspirational future. However, the general opinion seems to be; girls in the West are unhappy and this is reflected in low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide.\nA recent British documentary highlighted the challenges for an Afghan girl as she fought to avoid being sold as a bride (to provide money for her brother) and her fight to be free to achieve her musical ambitions. She was throughout very philosophical; even when told by her grandmother she could be sold to an eighty-year-old. As a young Western girl, you might conclude OMG!\nHowever, OMG hardly captures the reality. Too many western girls behave with a level of self-loathing that would be understandable if they were being sold to an eighty-year-old. But why? Well we believe that girls in the West have lost part of one gender identity as full-time mothers and gained another partial identity as workers whilst being sold two myths; one is that the “free market” delivers happiness via mass consumption and that the tendency to objectify themselves and therefore others is due to them personally rather than a process encouraged by the free market to maximise consumption. This latter point is reflected in attempts to get girls to “get real” about themselves. The girls need to “get real” about the “free market”!!\nThe free market is a means of making money. Unlike in the past when making money was about creating jobs today the jobs are in China or India. This has elevated consumption above production as the main economic preoccupation. Consumption doesn’t require a working class it simply requires consumers and a means of creating enough wealth to provide the means of consumption (as opposed to the means of production). This wealth can be engineered by governments in the form of welfare spending or it can be “liberated” from increased asset values like house price increases. Whilst men and women are cast in the role of consumer (consumer having replaced subject or citizen) it seems to us that being a woman has added complication in that personal consumption can be increased by dint of one’s attractiveness or ability to be relaxed about getting pregnant whilst dependent upon state benefits.\nIn the past the two roles women could take advantage of were separated by marriage. Worker prior to marriage and mother thereafter. Today they are blended but the blending is simply intended to maximise the woman’s consumer capacity, so loyalty to others disappears for them as well as for men. For both males and females being with the rich man and marrying the beautiful woman is the corrosive aspiration downloaded into everyone at birth. In the case of men low wages exclude them from the mass consumer club, for women, average looks have the same effect. (an attractive woman can “trade up”) For both, debt can, in the short-term increase ones “consumption coefficient” but for women, the conflict between the two roles is mediated if not indeed manipulated by government policy, in particular, welfare. The problem for girls is that being conflicted around serious life choices is dispiriting, depressing and confusing and eventually it is too easy to default to having children; wanted or not!! thereby opting out of the world of work or being compromised with a work life balance that puts work before children.\nFinally, for too many men the alternative to being successful is suicide; physically removing themselves from the gene pool….often having sired a couple of children. The most recent figure show that suicide is the highest cause of death for men between twenty and thirty-four. For others, crime is another “alternative” career that creates a consumer capability.\nThe free market is not wholly a force for good it has the capacity to corrupt and distort peoples expectations, turning love, loyalty and duty into different forms of greed. The public feel this on both sides of the Atlantic but possibly don’t understand where the feeling comes from. However, the “free market” loving political elite neither feel nor understand the problems with this inhuman and corroding system and are therefore shocked when the public reject them because they won’t reform, modify or control this system.\n02.12.16 The Blue Revolution has some challenges which the “liberal elite” might find uncomfortable. Let us examine one!\nThe experts have just concluded that advice and education is a waste of time when it comes to controlling alcohol misuse and pricing policy is more effective. In this world of “rational expectations” does this help us to understand how best to create a nonreligious morality fit for the 21st century?\nSince the turn of the 20th century, there has been a slow relentless decline in moral behaviour. It has been met by an ever expanding system of welfare that the public sector elites view quite wrongly as “progressive”. How such a word can be used to justify a policy which undermines moral choices is hard to comprehend. Here at a Blue Revolution, we believe in Contract, Choice, and Consent and take the view that adults should be capable of navigating their lives within this moral framework with some limited scope for state support in the short term as necessary for individuals who fall on hard times. However with a western society grown fat and lazy on welfare and state largess something needs to be done to re-engineer society back to a place where adults are fully competent moral agents and not the beneficiaries of an undermining culture of state money and a sanctimonious moral relativism. The contract, Choice, and Consent should be all that is required to underpin a truly moral society. We are going to look at Contract, Choice, and Consent in relation to procreation.\nAt the time of the birth of Britain’s welfare state, society was moral to the point where too many personal choices were deemed immoral and in some cases like homosexuality illegal. This was both a dark age and an age of peculiar enlightenment. Christianity left a legacy of marriage by consent and those mature enough to understand the awesome obligations associated with marriage went on to provide loving stable and productive homes for themselves and their children. The element of choice and consent is there and the marriage ceremony itself is an “illiterates contract”. The persecution of gays and lesbians was and remains immoral. A person sexuality has no relevance to their social or economic productivity.\nUnfortunately, society changed, in some ways for the better but not in all ways. Something commonplace during the war but which lay dormant after the war began to filter into society and that was “sexual abandon”, a bi-product of war which became “sexual liberation” in the 1960’s. Sexual liberation was heralded by the “shagging” community as a way of marking themselves out from the more buttoned up or as they would argue repressed community. The sex scandals of the present age have their origins in this “sexual liberation”. It was and still is a predators charter.\nSexual liberation is bad enough when the consequences are hurt feelings, personal disgust, and divorce, but it significantly worse when a child is produced either because of “sexual liberation” or a child is caught in the middle of “sexually liberated parent(s).\nSo having exposed what we consider to be the problem; what do we see as the solution? Well, it can’t be more of the same, state money to subsidise wanton stupidity. No, if we have to consider the financial consequences of millions of selfish “liberated” life choices we might take the view that this liberation has to stop. to avoid behaving like some prig or moral dinosaur such as we find in dust bowl Islamic societies like Saudi Arabia we need to protect individual choices and respect an adult’s moral agency. Contract, Choice and Consent does this. But what of those who fail to behave like adults, the children of the age of sexual liberation for whom Contract, Choice and Consent are irrelevant concepts.\nWell, this is where we at a Blue Revolution become a little more draconian; because a society based on Contract Choice and Consent has to have a way of encouraging compliance with responsible behaviour and disincentivize morally poor behaviour. This is done by having a national policy of DNA registration. A pregnancy is no longer an act of one sided selfishness with the more vulnerable gender picking up the moral pieces and the social disapproval. The process should be based on consent and choice and a contract between the parents to support the child. In the absence of this being negotiated by free mature moral agents, the state should step in and force the parents, confirmed via DNA to support their offspring. If education doesn’t work for alcohol misuse why would we assume it would work for reckless procreation.\nThe “liberal elite” will argue that registering DNA is an infringement of human rights. That is because there is money to be made from the social and moral chaos upon which the state thrives. However just as all our rights are now contingent on fair play to all of us taxpayers, particularly now that the wealthy corporations have decided that tax avoidance is a moral imperative, knowing who has sired whom and therefore who should pay is essential to help re-motivate people towards improved moral behaviour. We would argue that this change will be a bitter pill for the underclass to swallow, but it will we guarantee….note guarantee, improve the lives and expectations of boys and girls, put promiscuity into retreat and place children as the pinnacle of a safe and coherent union between parents who have thought about children ahead of a promiscuous lifestyle. No punishing the fornicators, no sex education explaining what to do with your “farm parts” just a lesson in contract choice and consent and the consequences of having unprotected sex on your bank balance and future happiness and prosperity. Here at Blue Revolution, we consider that as sexual intercourse releases powerful hormones it is a bit like a drug. So let’s tackle its worst social aspects in the manner of substance misuse. Let’s treat it like a dangerous substance!\n04.12.16 What is wrong with “Remainers”? Their love of the State doesn’t stop with the EU that’s what!\nThe Lib Dems are claiming to have made a come back with electoral success based they say on a campaign which was largely anti Brexit. It is not clear to us why the sort of people who live in Richmond would be 70% in favour of “remain”. However, there are other “affluent” constituencies which also have a similar profile so perhaps it is about being affluent. Here at a Blue Revolution, we are well enough educated, and global in outlook but not affluent so unlike the affluent we can’t accept the idea of an expensive government over running our lives or accept the idea of rule by superstate.\nIn the twenty-first century, the superstate is essentially an arrangement which sees the little bit of non-debt backed value created by workers being consumed by the state, for the ultimate benefit of the state. The welfare, health and human rights industries to name but three are basically the use of ordinary people’s lives and tax revenues to justify extraordinary wages for the states army of workers. Perhaps Richmond is full of well-paid state workers (£100K+) and bankers who either don’t have to worry about business profitability as they are Civil Servants or think that flogging debt to almost bankrupt European’s contributes to sustainable long-term progress.\nThe problem these affluent people face is their inability to accept there is a democratic deficit in staying in the EU. Whilst getting out might look complicated…. the problem is no one gave the tax paying public the option of opting into the superstate, it was a choice made for us by the elite. So now with all the soft fascism the elite can muster (even in the UK’s Private Eye and the Lib Dems pro-EU posturing amongst others) we need to resist the elites continued pleading for us to stick with their grand plan. We also need to resist the ideas of a left alliance of Greens and the Lib Dems who think Labour will help them salvage what for Brexiteers is the nightmare of remaining. This as we said, is a scenario that the public didn’t vote for and did actually vote against.\nIn reality and with the power of technology the State needs to wither away (a bit….or a lot ) but holding on to control and power runs against the interests of the ordinary people who want less of the State and its cost, not more. With idiots like the putative left alliance having a tantrum all over the place about everything, the prospect of the state continuing to strut it’s wholly tax gobbling and all too often self-serving and pointless stuff, is certain. Brexit starts the process of change.\n07.12.16 We are the people, the people are not the State. The State should be the servant of the people but with an elite in charge the State is our master!\nWe have commented on the relationship between the people and the State in various posts over the last few months and particularly as we worked our way towards Brexit. Concepts like “vested interests” “the establishment” only have meaning when the State and the people do not share common values. We believe that under the economic system that was known as Capitalism the State operated in the interests of the Capitalist class. Upholding “capitalist values”. These reinforced inequality in wages and flowing from that limited the rights of the workers to enjoy the full freedoms afforded by Contract, Choice and Consent. This went as far as creating a lifestyle limited environment of poor health, ignorance and low expectations.\nThe post-war era accelerated the process of turning the capitalist system around. it achieved this by putting the State centre stage, no longer operating on behalf of the vested interests of the Capitalist system which many viewed as the cause of World War II. Post war the State became the operator of big businesses, welfare protected the workers and the Grammar Schools elevated the children of “workers” into the establishment. It was like the children’s books of the day presented it; a rosy era for the working class. Those of us who remember this period remember a time when people were generally happy responsible and the state seemed to work for the people.\nThe post-war period was not all good news, however. “The People” were all too often represented by a labour movement hell bent on destroying a system that had really ceased to exist in the west BY THE 1970’S. British firms were being turned into commissioning bodies manufacturing abroad. The horror of the capitalist system was now largely inflicted on the proletariat of China, Korea, Vietnam etc. The left wing put the final nails in the coffin of what remained of the British manufacturing and extractive industries because of their blinkered ideological ignorance they viewed “Industry” as capitalist, so it was necessary to destroy industry and the jobs that went with it.\nThe challenge is this; what do you do when your capitalist system is collapsing around your ears. When not- withstanding its many flaws it no longer delivers the value and wealth necessary to support consumption by an increasingly entitled population. Well, you recognise that “globalisation” has a different way of delivering wealth and you try and game it to your advantage. This is what the people see as the problem with the current system. It is also why the traditional “left” have no answers. The state manages wealth and much of this wealth is generated by the debt and tax of workers. Unable to countenance any suggestion of a return to “capitalism” the left just promotes the same Tax and spend model to maintain demand and consumer satisfaction.\nThe problem is that by replacing vast swathes of the economy (if you don’t believe this take any British county or city and work out how many people work for its biggest employers; the NHS, Schools, County and District councils plus the odd prison or MOD Base etc) the government is trapped into maintaining itself first and foremost, and then it looks to supporting the rest of the economic system. This is the mechanism by which the state becomes the master of the people. Protecting the States interests is the main purpose of the state and its army of pointless 100K+ “Senior Leaders”. The people get in the way of this “nice little earner” hence the hissy fits from Statists like Britains Nick Clegg and an assortment of the State elites in parliaments (EU, Westminster, Scottish, Welsh, NI Assembly) and their supporting administrations; “Civil Servants” and Courts.\nSo what is the solution? Well to coin a phrase the workers need to raise their consciousness. Not like some long haired student Marxist bamboozled by the complex nature of Marxism who believes that the State is the answer to the inequalities of the world, but by realising that the State keeps a lot of people on great salaries doing very little that matters to ordinary people and these State people are the elite who work the system to their long-term advantage. A sort of perpetuating of disadvantage by pretending or virtue signalling that they are doing the opposite.\nThe modern economy has so much government in it that it can be easily characterised as a system operated by the State that takes workers debt and tax and turns it into salaries for its self-selecting elite. People like Nick Clegg, Keir Starmer, the Kinnocks, Blairs, the Judges of the higher courts and an army of people who do stuff in our name but not with our consent!!\n07.12 16 An Industrial strategy needs a policy on debt and pensions. These are yesterday’s challenge tomorrow!\nAn industrial strategy needs to cover a number of issues in the now globalised world. We think that dwarfing energy prices and other global uncertainties are the problems of debt and pensions. How did we get here? The modern free market is not capitalism. Capitalism requires the accumulation of capital. This was appropriated from workers in the form of the profits made by underpaying the workers. In a capitalist system, this capital became the basis for future investment, economic growth and of course future exploitation of workers.\nAs we argue the capitalist system had its faults but it was the progenitor of what we now have come to recognise as the modern world. It reflected the troika of Contract, Choice and Consent which underpins freedom and democracy and it demanded of those subject to its discipline a responsible way of life that required people to take care of themselves and their families and to have regard for their communities. They had to work out how to manage the wages borne of the exploitation by the capitalist. With the combination of Contract, Choice and Consent and the responsible worker looking to protect their families the fundamental building blocks of freedom and democracy became well established by the 1930’s. They endured the war and after the war, the government looked at the exploitation of an exhausted nation and intervened. They intervened to rebuild the economy and to minimise the levels of the wage exploitation by capitalists. The government never assumed that the qualities self-discipline hard wired into people by the capitalist system would not endure with a more interventionist government programme. They assumed that with welfare and pensions, health and education the future for working people was bright. It was until the beginning of the 1960’s.\nIn the 1960’s the capitalist system largely morphed into the modern free market. This is an immoral system. It has no context of responsible behaviour underpinning it. It encourages irresponsible social and economic behaviour. The post-war legacy of welfare became the means by which the free market managed to rid itself of any responsibility for the social and economic decline of the nation whilst relying on the welfare system to maintain wages and pensions. Sending work abroad and bringing migrants here allows the price of labour to decline whilst sending the manufacturing industry abroad allows free market profits to remain high. Paying for it all with debt and taxation allows consumer demand to be kept up benefitting the svengalis of the free market, people like Sir Philip Green. This is an almighty mess!\nPensions in the public sector, health care costs and a whole host of other inflating expenditures is bringing the national finances under unbearable strain. We need to start making a profit as a nation and relying on the “free market” with its urge to make money at the taxpayer’s expense really is not going to make Britain a leading industrial nation.\n10.12.16 The elite and their experts are still intent on confusing the public about the reality of Brexit and the “old world order”. But why? We look to the Uk for answers.\nIn the UK it is claimed Brexit means Brexit. Well that is like saying Justice means Justice; it means very little but unintentionally for Mrs May it sends a mixed message to those voters who Mr and Mrs Clegg and their NBF’s, the Blairs, Keir Starmer et al view as too stupid to understand the complex issues associated with the UK departing the EU; namely most of the British people both Brexiteers and Remainers.\nThe elites look down on the British people in a way that was inconceivable in the past; this is whether the people agree with them or not. Is it amongst other things our ability to load our sentences with actual often difficult meaning rather than speak articulately and yet simultaneously say nothing? it is our ability to live lives with none of the “status” craved by D-list “Slebs” and the elite in the places that warehouse them like the Big Brother House, BBC, EU and Westminster? or is it even more elemental?\nThe reason for their disdain, and if you don’t know what we mean watch Emily Thornberry MP, is the fact that we are no longer essential “factors of production” within the British economy. Factors of production that have to be “heard”, respected and won over to maintain capitalism’s promise of creating social and economic value and tax revenue for the State. We “the people” are now just a means by which the government can manipulate the economy to maintain aggregate demand through tax, debt and welfare and thus secure for a little longer the free market merry-go-round that keeps them in their positions of rank and privilege and allows some people who game the system to get rich. This maintains the pretence that the economic system is “just” and laden with opportunity for all. The modern Economic System delivers little by way of social and economic “justice”. We call it “secular wWesternism” as it delivers unhappiness, misery and destruction of the planet (no not the myth of solely man-made global warming stoopid) on an industrial scale.\nAs usual with a Blue Revolution, there is a lot in the above. Let us identify some examples. Global warming is the global issue most promoted by the elite. It helps to take the public’s eye of the “secular western” ball. The problem with the world economy is that with debt as the basis for economic prosperity there needs to be a ravenous “growth” to repay debt, replenish pensions and maintain stock and property prices. This requires an attack on our beloved planet like no other, over-population, deforestation and the volume of extraction, pollution and species annihilation, and yet whilst the elite talk of progress i.e. economic success reducing poverty and global conflict etc, we say yes, but at what price! Can it be done in a more planet-friendly way?\nTo tackle this head on the “elites” would need to scale back their own activities and recalibrate the world economy to something more sustainable and for them scary too; something measurable and achievable, co-operation and non-conflict based. Unwilling to change the nature of the western hegemony they promote “man-made global warming”; and Kyoto, the secular western elite’s impotent proxy for actually doing something to save the planet. Oh and the so called “Greens” buy into this rot too, along with the “storm troopers” of the elite……the academic “expert”.\nTo save the planet we would need to cut the birth rate through women’s education and employment, restrain the gender obsessions upon which too much of the free market is built and which across all demographics promotes reckless single parenthood. We must establish some global and universal values; we offer contract, choice and consent and we must stop the free market merry-go-round of “growth at all costs” and then more growth. This means moving away from a debt based economic model with the state as ringmaster to one based on achieving high levels of non-debt-based social and economic value by for example opening up Africa to agri-trade whilst restraining population movements by encouraging sustainable, non-growth obsessed economies in countries that currently export people rather than productivity.\nOn the Uk domestic front, the elites won’t tell you that the British economy is so dependent on migration that it actually needs “free movement of people” i.e. the movement to the UK of whole families. We have argued that “free movement of workers” is “just” and fair. However, it is unlikely to deliver the crippling levels of migration that the state needs to inflate the housing, property, stock and welfare markets which just so happen to contribute to the UK’s economic “growth”.\nThere is growth out there Jim but not as we know it, and as Brexit showed, not as we like it.\nApols to “The Firm”.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-western-world-needs-to-consider-why-our-culture-lacks-worldwide-appeal-we-consider-some-ideas/content_189.html": "The western world needs to consider why our culture lacks worldwide appeal. We consider some ideas.\nThe western world has progressed from tribalism through to the current “free market” which is an evolved form of capitalism. Capitalism, of course, required the creation of economic value. This economic value is essentially the profit after labour and other costs have been deducted from the sale price. Economic value is necessary whether one is a fan of capitalism or one is a Marxist. For fans of capitalism, the economic value is ‘rightly’ owned by the capitalist making him or her very rich. For the Marxist, the economic value is ‘stolen’ by the capitalist and is rightly the property of the workers. This is where the Marxist axiom “all property is theft” comes from.\nThe process of capitalism required as we have said before the development of the legal concepts of contract, choice and consent. Over two hundred years or more these legal concepts have taken on a ‘social character’ and are widely understood in the western world to underpin all social rights, equalities and freedoms including women’s rights, rights to ones sexuality and our different types of democracy. However, within the context of capitalism whether one agrees with the way value is distributed or not our freedoms were underpinned by a moral system that created value via production of goods for sale. This productive context has been replaced with the largely amoral ‘free market’ which sells product but doesn’t produce it.\nSo here is the crux of the problem. The western world has become dependent not on production to create value but by debt to create consumption. The whole thing is geared through various markets which drive the industrialisation of activities from marriage to education to pornography. Some people get very rich as actual production goes on in low wage economies whilst indigenous workers get low wages or welfare for servicing the ‘consumption economy’.\nWith debt driving consumption and consumption driving the free market the planet is put under increasing strain. There is no balance to this system. Debt based money is easy to come by as the price of assets like housing underpin the debt which then drives the consumption. It will fail again and spectacularly. That is the number one reason why many non-western countries dislike our western culture. They can see it is unsustainable.\nReason number two that there is a widespread dislike of the western world is that the ‘free market’ turns everyone into a tradable commodity. No longer an employee within an economic context based on work and production but a consumer to either consume or be consumed or both. This disassociation makes people lose their humanity and engage in activities that would in any more traditional society be seen as shameful, illegal or immodest.\nWe used the phrase ‘secularphobia’ to describe the fear of western culture by more traditional people of faith. This secular phobia is really a fear of the free market and its drive to expand consumption with debt. If we don’t find a way to stop the relentless drive for debt based growth our culture of freedom based on contract, choice and consent will end with the inevitable collapse of the free market. With that collapse will end the economic necessity for contract choice and consent will also end and we could find those who perhaps find our culture has no appeal will have the last laugh. What will happen to our western values then. We and we mean the vast majority of middle class, lower middle and working class people could end up being pauperised with a new political elite acting as overlord in a system that owes more to feudalism than democracy. A bit like China today!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-loathing-by-the-white-elite-for-white-middle-aged-men-we-comment/content_330.html": "The loathing by the white elite for white middle-aged men. We comment.\nWhy is it difficult to identify the cause of the distaste for the white middle-aged, middle-class male by the white non-grafting elite. Some have speculated that the elite are ingratiating themselves with the theologians of PC or virtue signalling the new culturally approved piety of cultural Marxism. Some of these arguments are persuasive and for one commentator Toby Young writing in the Spectator hopes to work out his preferred opinion before he has to part with more television licence fee money as the BBC elite are advocates of getting white middle-aged males off the box.\nFor Blue Revolution, it is a very straightforward issue, but hard to explain. So here goes. The elite has a hair trigger for ‘class’ being oversensitive about what they see as their own privileged position culturally politically and in the arts. However, they seem unwilling to grasp the fact that class, as anything meaningful in a Marxist sense no longer has relevance and, rather embarrassingly, it has been replaced by a global resurgence of the ancient concept of ‘status’. Obsessing about class and ignoring status allows them to overlook the new post-capitalist structures that have created their own privileged position in life.\nIn classical Marxist terms, the ‘class of a person is created by the relationship between that person and the means of production and in particular, their role in creating wealth. The modern elites are not therefore defined by ‘class’ but as such but by their status. This is because they have gained and hold power and influence not by exploiting workers in a Marxian sense, but by operating within a closed system that has power and influence paid for by taxation or debt which is taken at source from workers wages, or in the case of the BBC the licence fee.\nThis creates an embarrassing problem for the ‘right on’ elite. They recognise their own superiority compared to what they incorrectly see as the ‘working class’. However, its difficult to accept their lofty position may be part of the problem based on their own ‘privilege’ because as pseudo-Marxists they adopt the view that they are there to promote as ‘class outsiders’ the interests of the working class and all its minority offshoots be they black, transgender or Gay. This is ‘Blairism’ or ‘Clintonism’. This explains why they still think there is a Capitalist class that needs bashing and don’t see there a privileged class of elites of which they are part.\nFor the pseudo-Marxist elite, therefore, the only way of maintaining this idea of working-class ‘good’ ‘middle class’ bad, is to turn their back on to those they see as less important members their class group. This is the use of status and status has never been class-based, it is an ancient privilege that is conferred by acquired or inherited power, and is definitely not linked to one’s role in the grubby world of the productive economy.\nThis privilege passes within families (Kinnock’s/Blairs/Freud’s etc) and allows a person to publicly denounce their own ‘class’ members with a degree of relaxed superiority based on their status. To preserve their status and feel good about their values this high-status elite are able to denounce or sack those of similar ‘class’. All with the connivance of the status-dependent 21st-century’ state’ or the Board of the BBC and then to dress up their values as a war on ‘class’ privilege, as opposed to status. This pretty much explains the battle lines in Brexit. The High-status elite against the lower and middle-status workers.\nThey get away with it because they understand how the intellectually deficient ‘left’ respond approvingly to ‘dog whistle’ terms like a class privilege and class disadvantage.\nThe modern world is turning back towards status as in the West ‘class’ as a meaningful way of defining people declines in relevance. Most of the non-capitalist world still reflects ‘status’ which is an ancient form of describing power and importance. In much of the wider world as well as in the West there is no such thing as a modern exploiting middle class so there is no exploited ‘working class’. Even so class privilege rather than status continues to be the elites ‘straw man’ tackled by virtuous pseudo-Marxists whilst they cunningly ignore their own illegitimate status and the illegitimate power that goes with it.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_its-so-backward-its-awkward-the-working-peoples-west-and-islam-in-the-21c/content_226.html": "7C Islam in the 21C working people’s West.\nWe all find certain things embarrassing, ‘Chuggers’, Mormons, Scientologists, Hasidic Jews, “happy-clappy” Christians, and Morris men. But no one wants them to stop enjoying their lives. In the 21st century, we want everyone to enjoy their lives in peace. But we might shuffle away as they approach.\nIslam, of course, goes back to the 7th century. Its values reflect a period in history when brutality and indifference to pain characterised much of the world. The difficulty of making money and creating capital in Arabia and in the rest of the Islamic world from the 7th century onwards limited its ability to progress economically and therefore it was unable to progress socially. We are economic materialists after all.\nModern social progress is a product of capitalist success. In a nutshell the ability of a new middle class to acquire capital from the labour power of others via contract’s rather than slavery or serfdom. This eventually gave the world the principles of Contract, Choice and Consent which in turn drove the demand for these economic principles to take on social character and form the 18th-century democracy that we still have today, and which has gone around the world via the British Empire.\nUntil recently in the West gender relationships were historically unequal. But male and female rights eventually succumbed to the democratising juggernaut of capitalism. Capitalism was back then, as the free market is today indifferent, to the background, sex and race, sexuality, gender identity and faith. Sexual inequality was required socially not economically. In capitalism, its only injustice is its inherent economic unfairness, rich or poor.\nWorkers of the western world who have lived in the capitalist system and seen their rights extended within it will have a solid grasp that whilst capitalism is an unfair system, some win and some loose, it has created a very broad and far-reaching equality. There is little discrimination in capitalism as the principles of capitalism have no role for discrimination. Discrimination is bad for business.\nSo, into this well established economic and social environment come a large group of people for whom the egalitarianism of capitalism is in some cases alien. Many harbouring a 7th-century belief system founded on their holy book the Koran, and the Hadith, which reflects the economic necessities of their day, for example, the different treatment of women, homosexuals or those of different faiths.\nThe penalty for breaking the rules in all simple agrarian and impoverished cultures is similarly harsh. Stoning, beheading, beating are all promoted in Holy books and by some of the followers of faiths and denominations today. The clash of cultures, therefore, can’t be more real between those who live by the experience of the liberal West and those who hold traditional “faith” based views. There is little to unite these groups culturally. If one accepts submission and control it’s difficult to grasp the role of contract, choice and consent.\nIt takes a while to compartmentalise and set aside one’s own irrational bias before one can come up with a possible explanation for this phenomenon of some in the West promoting what are largely un Western values. Once you reflect on the theology and psychology involved in dealing on a personal level with the traditional values in Islam, for example, it becomes easier to see that we are basically uncomfortable about the whole situation and don’t recognise the relevance of Islamic values in the 21st century. It is hard to see how someone who believes in equal rights for all with no discrimination on gender or grounds of sexuality can find any common ground within what is presented as the Islamic faith today. There will, of course, be people of the Islamic faith who accept the values of the Enlightenment but the Holy book and Hadith are claimed to be the infallible instruction from God and Muhammad, so the challenge can’t be underestimated.\nThe internet has examples of the faithful from all faiths explaining the approach to various issues from the vantage point of their faith. So it raises the question what can one really say to an earnest young man who would like to see girls married at the age of 8? or the dress code for men and women that is intended to set aside equality between the sexes and may indeed feed male entitlement? Or the issue of unofficial street praying or the publicly expressed demand for this punishment or that practice. It is uncomfortable having to make sense of these differences in opinion and perspective in the twenty-first century. When confronted by the unreformed value base of all faiths but specifically Islam it makes those with modern values behave in an oddly incoherent way, so we can avoid dealing with it.\nThe solution is not that difficult to imagine. At every social, legal and political level it should be acknowledged that some ideas are just basically incompatible with the modern world whether it be restricting reproductive rights for women or the demand for Sharia councils. Because these ideas are well out of date in the 21st century the advocates of these ideas make us feel uncomfortable and we shy away from a debate. We should not. The days of neo-colonial toleration of the sort that doesn’t challenge ideas must stop as under the auspices of faith and for some within the faith community, we find FGM, circumcision and other forms of harm. There is nothing wrong with feeling uncomfortable about someone else’s idea, it’s not illegal…..yet!\nOne final point is this. We are where we are because we too have out of date institutions on us namely our near-universal western 18th-century political system. This system will never reflect the rights of working people but whilst we must continue to shout to keep our 18th-century progressive values, of contract, choice and consent, we must fight to change the 18th-century political systems that are currently undermining these hard fought for values, once only enjoyed by the men of the bourgeois.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-faith-of-islam-vs-christian-values-it-might-just-be-about-economics/content_242.html": "The faith of Islam and our “Christian values”. It might just be about ancient economics.\nIntroduction\nThis paper is not a critique of faith. That is in the hearts and minds of the believer, something for which we have full and unequivocal respect. This paper will seek to put the case for different religions reflecting different material circumstances at any point in history. As it was in Marx’s day for he and Engels believed the Christian religion reinforced the then nineteenth-century bourgeois world order.\nPerhaps to maintain the domination of economics and politics by a capitalist economic elite, the idea took root that all morality was “relative” in other words you could not say one set of moral principles was better or more just than any other. However, with the rise of global communication, the world needs to reflect on moral relativism and perhaps having adopted it because of its anti-Marxist and pro “bourgeois” credentials, think about where moral relativism is leading the world today.\nFrom Savagery to Barbarism according to Frederick Engels\nKarl Marx and but more specifically Frederick Engels were in the final analysis moral absolutists. However, the Economically liberal Western world, perhaps out of fear that a single unifying moral perspective might deliver Marx’s egalitarian revolution, adopted moral relativism in the nineteenth century and it still holds a commanding position today. The problem with relativism is that it makes it difficult to say any moral principle or value is wrong.\nMoral relativism has for over one hundred years silenced our left-leaning liberal elite and has set them on a collision course with the ordinary worker who has a clear idea of right and wrong based on their ordinary western workers’ economic experience. The difference between religious moral absolutism and that of Marx and Engels is that they believed there was a scientific and economic explanation for humanities various “moral iterations”. These iterations placed one period of Humanities evolution above the other as we evolved from the savagery of the stone age through various stages of barbarism and finally into the period of civilization. The modern age. The description of this process can be found in Engels: The origin of the family, private property and the state (1884).\nThe theory simply put states that as humankind gained increasing levels of control over nature, by applying our unique ability to dominate the natural environment, the social and moral environment changed correspondingly. This ability to dominate nature is called by Marx and Engels “species-essence”.\nEngels was clear that this process of economic and therefore moral and social evolution was not a simple process. The environment and levels of science and technology played a part in different groups of humans around the world. Therefore, taken at any point in history, there would be a range of different economic and social models operating at the same time but for those with similar levels of economic sophistication, there would be more similarities than differences.\nEven today it’s possible to trace traditions that have been carried over from one period of economic and social evolution into another almost as if a ghost of a long forgotten past when material circumstances were markedly more primitive. The Scots Clans, for example, reflect a period when society was divided into tribal groupings. Even though the need for such groupings has not been present since Scotland emerged into the modern age, there is a certain modern pride in Clan identity.\nThe Native American had a tribe and clan-based society. When civilisation in the form of the “West” arrived on their shores they experienced a world alien to their simple tribal economic and social arrangements. Whilst they possessed many skills that enhanced their survival they were as a society characterised by two or three significant differences from the civilisations that would eventually conquer them.\nThese differences would be shared by all groups who were at a similar stage of economic and therefore social and moral development.\nOne of these characteristics was what Engels called consanguinuity. This is marriage like relationships within the wider family group, loose sexual unions where women would have several possible partners and as a result, lineage had to be taken via the female. The primacy of the female, called “mother right”, was due to certainty over maternity. If a brother and sister both had sons, the sister’s son was more important to the tribe than the brother’s son as maternity was a matter of fact and paternity rather more a matter of opinion. This gave women status in this period. However economic development and the development of wealth and trade would eventually change women’s status for the worse until fighting back for rights in the latter part of the modern age we call ‘now’.\nIn addition to these simple and loose marriage arrangements which would in time be classed as adulterous, the absence of private property was another characteristic of this period. It was impossible to build up “wealth” or in Marx’s term surplus economic value. Thus, any goods made by Native Indians, for example, had essentially use value only. They fulfilled an obvious purpose, for example, a spear for hunting or headdress for a warrior’s status. When food was sourced it was consumed collectively. It could not be stored. This wasn’t exactly a hand to mouth experience of the earlier period of “savagery” but it wasn’t full mastery over nature, in the modern sense either.\nThe final characteristic of this period was a strict but non-abusive distinction between male and female roles within the tribe. Men were hunters and warriors and females were child bearers and homemakers. There was a greater equality between the sexes than became the case as humanity evolved. Women were given status arising from their lack of reproductive ambiguity.\nIt is possible to consider numerous peoples from antiquity for whom lifestyle was similar in character. If food was short wars would be fought to conquer or be conquered. In such inauspicious circumstances economic and therefore social progress was practically impossible. It was a society on a war and starvation footing all the time. Rome, Greece and the land of Israel, as well as the desert lands all of the Middle East, would all have evolved from this model of “barbarism”.\nIt was the absence of creating wealth or exchangeable surplus economic value that for Engels is the fundamental condition that determines the social character of these “barbaric” societies. Their lives were overall simple but precarious and sometimes violent.\nIn Europe and the Middle East with no isolation as happened to Native Americans or Australasians, there was the possibility of progress, as different groups began to forge different economic circumstances and trade alliances which gave way to new forms of social and moral behaviour. For women, it proved to be a backward step.\nThe Mediterranean provided opportunities for nations like Greece and Rome to struggle free from the shackles of nature’s hard to conquer dominion. The consequence, however, was, with growing wealth accumulation and the evolution of wealth backed “status” a creeping dominion by man over man and more tellingly man over woman started to emerge. The tribal past with its relaxed moral values and lack of paternal certainty became an intolerable burden on the ability of men to create and command wealth and exercise power.\nThis next stage one move on from mere tribalism is the precursor to the development of early civilisation and the growth of the state. Once humanity was able to create surplus value via farming, herding, and manufacture for exchange, as well as store wealth in the form of gold and silver, the desire to gain power through wealth and control the environment both physically and morally increased.\nEconomics drove the wish for power, just as it does now, and as a result, it ushered in some revolutionary social and moral changes. With surplus value or wealth, there came the power men craved. This power could be concentrated into the hands of families or individuals who by controlling conception and inheritance became more important than the tribes they replaced. The value of mother right was eroded as men of wealth no longer needed to share women and have only ‘opinion’ as to who was the father of a child. It was possible to guarantee paternity via the absolute control of women and it made sense for men to turn their backs on the simple tribalism that saw greater equality between the sexes. The morality of this period is captured in Holy books like the Old Testament and the Koran. The faithful believe that the changes were a direct instruction from God. The reality for Marx and Engels and ourselves is that it came from powerful economic forces. Genesis 17.1-7, 15,16 captures the theology as opposed to the economics of this period quite well.\nThus, wealth enslaved women and it enslaved other men too as communities could be fed and housed avoiding the need to slaughter them and their labour power could be used to gain economic advantage, all based on “ownership”. This is better known as slavery. The slave society was merely a society that had achieved a greater mastery over nature and this mastery was no longer evenly distributed. For those with wealth, it gave mastery over others too.\nIt was during this period that the three great religions began to reflect in the articles of their faith the economic realities of their day. Arguably Lot’s wife and Sodom and Gomorrah is a reference to the abandonment of mother right (and all the liberty for women that went with it) in favour of father right and the all-powerful monotheistic male God.\nThe Old Testament, New Testament and Koran reflect social change only because economic reality had changed ahead of it. In the form of these new religions, society catches up and codifies the rules of the new world economic order.\nWithin Islam, the process of rejecting the old ways takes longer to become established. The tradition of nomadic tribes and prior to the seventh-century little-written record keeping might explain why it was harder for the Arab nations to build up wealth. But none the less by the seventh century the growth and more importantly the wealth of global economics was making it possible for certain groups and individuals within Arab tribes to secure a greater share of the worlds riches and as a result allowed men to violently shunt aside the “gods” that reflected mother right just as the Jews and Christians had done.\nArguably therefore for the Arab tribes of the seventh century, the culture of mother right and the loose ’uneconomic’ morals that went with it was becoming untenable. To men who were, as Mohammed was, able to secure wealth through trade and war there was a mission to put to an end the practices of the past as the benefits of trade and wealth would be lost if the old order wasn’t removed. Therefore, adultery became a grave crime punishable with great cruelty and women were forced to adopt a level of modesty that would render them invisible but for their reproductive functions. However not wishing to miss out altogether on multiple female partners concessions to the old order were given in the form of polygamy……but just for the male.\nThe new values were all embracing reflecting this masculine economic change and the wealth and power it created over others. Within the Middle East, there had been a period of great trade and enlightenment and the religion of Islam was adopted widely conferring stability on tribal societies in many parts of the world. The word caliphate is little different from Christendom. Each faith believing it reflects the formula for economic success and therefore moral purity. But the driver was and still is in our view economic rather than theological. Had it not made economic sense to adopt new economic principles such as restricting women’s rights no society would have.\nEngels didn’t touch on the Middle East in The origin of the family, private property and the state, concentrating on North America, Britain and Europe. It has been possible because of the strength of his writing and his “scientific” method to explore the role of economics in religion, morality and society outside of the areas of his interest.\nWe can explore what it means to us in the twenty-first century as we try and grasp the emerging cultural conflict with Islam and other faith beliefs across Britain and Western Europe.\nThe web and Twitter are littered with groups who see Islam as anything from a death cult to the hairspring for Armageddon. The response from some Christian groups is to rage with as much fervour as a Jihadi and even some secular thinkers who promote the idea of a clash of cultures seem to conclude that the answer for the Western world is a restating of “Christian values”. We say this solution to solving the incompatibility of Islam and other faiths with western liberal culture will work. And here is why.\nFirstly, Christianity, as we have said earlier like all faiths, reflects material realities and therefore is no different from the Islamic faith or any other comparable faith, in this respect. The abandonment of mother right and the adoption of a fearsome God was all part of an economic change that took place when tribalism gave way to more productive ways of creating wealth and more importantly storing it and owning it. There may be some differences in application but essentially the outcome for women, for example, was the same, a culture of varying degrees of subjugation. Although it does have to be conceded that Islam has cruelty, so in the past did Hinduism with the practice of Sati ensuring economic needs were reflected in enforced moral behaviour.\nEconomic circumstances having created a male-centric God to reflect male-centric wealth creation and values, the wealth created came into the hands of a few families headed by men and it stayed there. This is a unifying fact across all Middle Eastern and European religions, up to roughly the 16th century.\nChristianity, therefore, has no great claim to being peaceful or ‘moral’. Unimaginable horror was inflicted on people in the name of Christianity particularly in the Sixteenth Century when a Christian faith Catholicism was propping up an economic system, the feudal system which was being assailed by a new theology called Calvinism. Calvinism itself, of course, a product of evolving economic forces namely the ‘laws’ of the free market and capitalism. At this time the engine of the economy was controlled by an aristocracy and an ambitious and increasingly wealthy middle class wanted a change. Calvin and Luther provided the theology!\nThe bourgeois revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth–centuries in Britain and the nineteenth century in Europe reset the clock for Christianity, giving it a benign ‘bourgeois’ appearance based on contract, choice and consent that ignored its origin and violent use over the years.\nIslam in the West today is no different from Christianity in the past. It still reflects values that hark back to the abandonment of mother right and the exercising of control over women arising out of the accumulation of wealth and its inheritance. The difference between Islam and Christianity, however, is Christianity has been forced to go through several convulsions due to the changing economic circumstances in the West and specifically the need for Contract, Choice and Consent to be established so as to ensure the smooth operation of the bourgeois capitalist system.\nSo, when people with an Islamic background are preaching, or arguing about the Wests immorality and advocating FGM, veiling, stoning or beheading they are essentially speaking from the moral perspective of a culture steeped in seventh-century economic necessity full of obedience, honour, violence and force with little if any choice or rights. The problem is the West doesn’t challenge these outmoded and economically irrelevant views.\nOf the West, the devout Muslim would and does highlight our ‘shame’ and the weakness of our Christianity which has been shorn of anything other than supporting personal choice. But that is because our free market requires that characteristic. Everything is about economics, today yesterday and forever. And the Muslim faithful take advantage of this economic reality too. The world is unfair and unequal and it offends people of faith….or it should do.\nThe question on all sides in the cultural head to head is this. Once you have stripped out the faith belief and stare at the hard realities of these ancient moral principles and values, one Christian the other Islamic or whatever, you can see that the debate is really about which one is fit for purpose in the 21st century and that is down to economics and economics alone.\nThe Within all faiths there are passionate and devout advocates for purity. The Jihadi who wants to destroy civilisation really wants to bring coherence to his seventh-century social values by creating a seventh-century economic environment with the destruction of “civilisation”. The shrouded woman advocating stoning adulterers or beating wives is a ghost from a bygone era still fighting to destroy rights that women lost over one thousand years ago to male power and dominion, before struggling to regain many of them back in the twenty-first century. But still not fully.\nWearing the Hijab or full veiling of a more extreme kind may be a free choice, it may be a political statement or even simply cultural expectation or it may simply be an example of seventh-century moral behaviour to demonstrate adherence to “faith”.\nSimilarly, the shrill Christian evangelicals with their Armageddon theology and the earnest men praying in a park are making a statement are all are playing a game……but it is simply a twenty-first-century economic one based on free choice in a free country. We should all see what is going on and understand the “theology” of it. It’s only ancient economics after all.",

We have become so used to arguing about identity and rights that are promoted within the elite’s political agenda that we have lost sight of who, we are as a group.\nThe working people are defined by Blue Revolution in this way. A) Do you rely on your labour power alone to make a living? B) Are you in receipt of welfare? C) When you die will you leave enough to enable your children to live a life which does not require them to engage in waged labour? Finally, D) are you well connected enough to ensure that if your children do depend on waged labour you can ensure access to high waged work opportunities? If you answer yes to A and B you are a waged or potentially a waged worker and could be part of a revolutionary class. If you answered yes to C and D, you are part of the elite and probably part of the problem.\nGetting the workers views embedded in the nation state requires us to limit the state’s power. We believe western workers are mature and flexible enough to play an important role informing social, economic and political policy.\nIn the UK there are 26 County Councils and 192 district councils and 190 unitary councils at every administrative level above parish council. These councils will have anywhere between 30 and 80 plus councillors who are ordinary workers and probably meet our blue-collar criteria above. They will come from every walk of life and unlike Westminster MP’s generally they will not go through a rigorous two-day selection process that weeds out eccentrics and potential troublemakers.\nThese people connect with local communities, reflect the views of local communities, and respect local communities. Even those local communities where ideas based on religious observance remain established. They too need to have a voice as members of their respective community.\nThe party system works in the interests of political parties and this takes away the sense that politicians work on behalf of the people. Political parties are a microcosm of the state itself. The modern state reflects systems of power and control that existed before working class men had the vote in the nineteenth century.\nWhen members of the political elite worry about the democratic deficit (large numbers of people not voting in elections for example, or councillors being elected with less than five percent of the eligible vote) which suggests working people don’t trust the system or politicians in general, their solution is to extend voting to sixteen year olds or bribe people to vote. Having more people voting in the same out of date eighteenth-century system is not the answer. It is all very well throwing aside eighteenth-century beliefs like homophobia but preserving eighteenth century institutions undermines efforts at real reform. It needs working people to inform and contribute to political decision making.\nThe way to resolve this democratic deficit is relatively simple bring lower tier authority councillors into the legislature. In the community there will be councillors who could make valid contributions to debates but cannot as they do not sit in parliament. The solution is to create what we call a legislative college. This idea backed up by technology allows any “elected member” from any administrations including in time parishes, to “come in” on a parliamentary debate. In time they could acquire the right to vote in parliament too. The MP for the area will have some real competition from “lower tier” authority members and will need to ensure that their profile is maintained if they are to preserve their seat. All excellent for democracy, access to democratic decision making and progress.\nOpponents will say it will make governing impossible. That will not happen because the executive’s policies will be either voted for or voted down. The executive would need to be elected by the whole legislature to ensure the end of tribal left- and right-wing adversarial politics and the nonsense of votes of no confidence and ‘whipping in’. Losing a vote on a bad idea will become the will of the people, not the death of an administration. It thus will make the democratically elected executive more cautious and accountable.\nTo develop this idea which is technologically possible and get it past the elite, will need a Blue ’workers’ Revolution. Ultimately it will mean for example that no government can take us to war by relying on a supine and docile parliament as Tony Blair did and no government would escape the reality of its policies on the working people most affected. The changes to our lives that artificial intelligence or climate change might impose on working people must not happen until working people have given policies political legitimacy.\nThe whole project can be financed by abolishing the House of Lords.\nSUMMARY\nCurrently six hundred and fifty MP’s represent 65 million people. They look and sound like an elite class because they are. Ordinary people pay for the political system and deserve to have a big role in deciding national policy. Giving the right to speak and vote in parliament takes away the power of the bourgeois socialist elite of all parties including the Conservative Party.\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary",

A bit like library closure perhaps. Whilst some rural areas and town centres may either benefit from lights out, allowing the night sky to re-establish its prominence or don’t require it as there are sufficient shop lights to illuminate the area, there are those areas where the lights out is clearly a hazard. Most noble amongst which is Woad Farm estate.\nThe complexity of the issue must not be used to justify us swerving it, as it affects some of the most vulnerable communities in Boston. It is simply not acceptable for LCC to increase Council tax and then claim it is necessary to make “essential” cuts whilst paying some senior managers six-figure salaries with pensions to boot. This situation has built up over many decades where general tax payers and council tax payers are increasingly funding wage levels that lift too many government workers into the financial fist division.\nThis wage structure owes more to the nineteenth century than the twenty-first century and governments and local authorities need to stop and think about the people on average wages and lower who pay them and thus the majority the people they are supposed to serve.\nLCC should be shamed into adopting a more considered policy on lighting, switch off where it adds value to communities and switch back on where the same thing applies. Like Woad Farm Estate in Boston.\nWe pay for and consent to lighting our streets, I don’t think we have consented to six figure salaries for officers. Like life before Brexit we have never been given an opportunity to comment. Like all County and Borough Council services where communities need it and pay for it communities should get it……or give the job of providing it to someone else.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_our-revolutionary-aims-introduction/content_18.html": "Introduction.\nThe world goes through revolutionary upheavals every two centuries or so and semi-revolutions every half century. The last one in the UK was in 1997 when Tony Blair acquired a mandate to secure the state’s total moral and social dominion over its people. In the U.S. Bill Clinton achieved the same thing. Their “third way” was based on the idea that the political elite knew better than the public what was good for them.\nTo avoid change being merely aspirational Tony Blair’s bourgeois socialist (1) elite knew that there would have to be some underpinning economic model that could pour funds into the British Treasury to finance the nation, generate moral renewal and deliver Blair’s New Jerusalem. Blair’s bourgeois socialists believed it would work because they did not really understand the long-term impact of the changes they were engineering. They were not economists.\nThe economic model that they developed was based on Government spending being used to boost economic growth and this it was believed would empower people to achieve their social and economic potential. In Abraham Maslow’s (2) terms people would ‘self-actualise’ or fulfil their personal ambition. The era of naïve economics and identity politics was born, to a fanfare of “things can only get better” by the band D:Ream.\nThe public were seduced by this model. Blair seemed like a nice guy and who could argue that in the UK public money had for decades been spent on health and welfare, and now it could achieve a multi-coloured kaleidoscopic Great Britain; a Britain shorn of reactionary forces like national pride, belief in the family, and personal responsibility. Who needs that stuff when the state is there to go beyond intervening from the cradle to the grave and can now usefully occupy itself spending public money so it can interfere with the public’s psychology too? These old ideas thought the bourgeois socialists would be consigned to the dustbin of history, just as bonded serfdom and illiteracy had been.\nThe only problem was that the economics did not stack up. So along with the Financial Crisis of 2007/8 the other consequences of this model has been growing wealth inequality plus the inability of the state to make good its 1997 social and welfare promises and a burden on the taxpayers of the present and future who pay to keep this system in existence.\nThis model is what we at Blue Revolution call the Secular Western hegemony or more simply “secular-westernism”. Secular-westernism will need a revolution to shift it. Not a violent revolution because violent revolutions are, like the revolutions in China and Russia, effectively a triumph of the state over the individual, albeit with an initially benign intention but in both cases a lot of killing.\nA revolution will be needed because just like the aristocrats in the past, the modern big winners of the secular-western system, the politicians, bureaucrats, charity chiefs, and third sector organisations, the publicsectocracy as we call them, will not want to give up the power, status and wealth that goes with their elevated positions.\nIf you believe that today the hopeless attempt by western governments to extend democracy, promote welfare, international security and basic rights does not pass the sniff test, you may be right.

It is basically why so many people create economic value but so few people ever get to control it. From the moment we had more than we needed to survive as small tribes, systems of authority have sprung up to control surplus value and those authorities have controlled people. Whether it is the proto-feudalism of the Pharaohs or the early Kingdom of Israel or Muhammad’s Muslim Empire ordinary people has been subject to the violent rule of the minority. Religion playing the role of defending the social and economic reality for all involved.\nThe political ‘Right’ claim that the capitalist model delivers a greater equality. Certainly, in destroying feudalism it put an end to control and servitude for workers by those of superior status, the nobility, but in its place, we gained a more mobile and ever-changing hierarchy of capitalists and their political servants in parliament ‘contracting’ to undermine the rights of workers. Socialism was a reaction to this capitalist exploitation. It sought to control capitalism and redistribute capitalist wealth in the ‘name’ of the workers. Wherever socialism was introduced however it only ever acted in the name of the workers’ apart from the brief period between 1945 and 1970 in the UK when it did serve the social as opposed to economic interests of the workers. After 1970 it ceased serving anyone’s interests other than the State itself. As the ‘socialists’ have always put it the workers were ‘exploited’ by the ‘bourgeoise’ or capitalists as they are now better known (see Opinion 11/02/2018) so the States job was to exploit them back.\nIn its defence, capitalism did create lasting legal principles such as contract, choice and consent which as Karl Marx anticipated have ‘taken on a social character’ and have become an expectation of working people the western world over. Preserving these values is now a revolutionary act in the face of the counter-revolutions being waged by the forces of the ideology of Islam, the corrosive effects of crony capitalism and the confused ideology of twenty-first century socialism shorn of its economic role to exploit capitalism in the name of workers and now neurotically fretting about ‘identity’ as though a collection of militant groups is a substitute for a revolutionary working class.\nSo the ‘Right’ is not right in thinking that ‘capitalism’ is fair… it’s not it needs regulation. But the left is wrong to think that capitalism is so wrong it needs exploitation by the State. Exploitation of capitalism by the State on ‘behalf’ of the workers has simply created an unaccountable class of State bureaucrats who no longer exploit the capitalists to pay for the State but exploit the workers to pay for it instead. This is therefore why the Left can’t be ‘left’…because it is now hell-bent on exploiting the workers through taxation and debt and the right isn’t right because capitalism is incapable of acting fairly and will always seek to exploit workers and always with the connivance of the State, even a left-wing State. Hence the Blair/Clinton/EU obsession with supporting crony capitalism.\nThe State is not the Nation the people are and they need to secure in perpetuity for our daughters and sons the values of contract, choice and consent and take over the running of the Nation from either an ideological ‘left’ or ideological ‘right’ State. Getting rid of the power of ideology is clearly the place to start particularly with the ideology of Islam trying to colonise both the left and the right!!",

It could stand for policy confusion, political censorship, psychological conditioning, or it could stand for proceed cautiously or it could stand for all four.\nAs economic determinists we believe we understand the urge for political correctness-after all we are more equal and deserving of respect. So it somehow feels right for the “PC brigade” to stand up for minorities. However whilst the historical process of tearing us away from tribe or feudal overlord is in the western world almost over, the process of achieving this was a legacy of capitalism. Capitalism’s need to establish bourgeois values like freedom based on contract, choice and consent meant that speech or thought, or expression should not be subject to illegitimate control as they had been in the centuries preceding the late 17th century. No wonder the hard left hate these values, they are after all bourgeois.\nBut bourgeois values are not the same as bourgeois institutions which (with the exception of the constitutional monarchy) the hard left want to maintain. They misunderstand the fundamental difference between bourgeois values and bourgeois institutions and they thus misunderstand how corrosive PC is to our bourgeois values and in particular freedom of speech and freedom of thought.\nThe bourgeois origins of our freedoms should not be used to dismiss their importance to us now. When we try to protect the more vulnerable members of our communities with PC values that strike before even the law can intervene, we are behaving in a pre bourgeois, and thus also a pre socialist and pre freedom way (socialism is capitalism’s first born!). The problem with PC is that it is essentially about protection from being “offended”. To the shiny new Oxbridge undergraduate who is excited about protecting the trans community or the disabled, PC isn’t seen as a justification for control. But it is just that. It is a means by which bourgeois values of freedom, including freedom of speech can be brought under someone’s control. With Political Correctness we are back in the pre capitalist world of illegitimate authority and control over thoughts and expression, control over ideas and behaviour. Control over who can think what and why.\nTo put this into some kind of perspective imagine if, after we had accepted that the bourgeois notion of “freedom of speech” could be compromised to avoid causing offence we were faced with a growing demand from people who felt “offended” about shaking a woman’s hand and demanded more segregation. Or people “offended” about unmarried parents and demanded controls on behaviour to prevent “illegitimate” children. We would be back in the 16th century.\nOnce you protect from “offence” where do you stop. In such situations as above the progressive legacy of our 18th century bourgeois revolution would have been squandered and progressive thinking reversed on the altar of trying to be nice and not offend.\nTo avoid a calamitous waste of three hundred years of bloodshed and social evolution we should all grow up, grow a thicker skin and continue to evolve as a species rather than return to an earlier simpler world where we are told what to think based on factors such as our gender, social position, race or sexuality. We no longer want people to know their place unless we are a hard left neandertal in which case we actually do. So with PC we say proceed with caution or simply abandon the project altogether.",

We consider some evidence. V2\nThe liberal elite; those custodians of our two party state and binary Parliamentary system have come in for a rough time recently. It’s been one disaster after another with the most recent being the inability of most of them to call the recent General Election result. The binary two party system with its fetishizing of adversarial politics has started to fail because it is reliant on promoting tribal self-interest underpinned by a docile and obliging population encouraged to see the benefits of buying into the benign state idea but only as long as the “State” works for them. The British Broadcasting Corporation colludes shamelessly with the political party elites and far from swerving allegations of “bias” actively promote bias against new entrants to the political system. They are allowed to do this by the absence of law preventing it, we presume to encourage “strong” government.\nUnfortunately, they are naive to think this is the right way of doing politics in the 21st century. In a socially engineered pluralist and diverse nation shoehorning opinion into two camps creates the very environment for apathy and the slogan politics so loved of the hard left and far right. It leaves most people feeling angry and un represented but no one from moderate left or right will challenge it or the right of public bodies like the BBC to promote it with their lazy “reductive polarities” masquerading as debate. It won’t be challenged because huge party political bureaucracies will decline and with their decline will decline opportunities for lobbying, promoting vested interests and the maintenance of the self-interest of politicians themselves. Just like UKIP has declined so would the Labour Party and Tories if the paradigm was to be broken, as of course, it should be. It is clearly time for a change.\nSo that is the nieve bit. The belief by the elite that the Westminster or Washington political machine an essentially 18th-century systems still work for the benefit of the many, not the few. Of course, it works after a fashion, but only for them! The many find themselves paying for the few and that few includes Corbyn’s Labour party. So what about stupidity?\nWell, having created a diverse cultural community which in some social and economic contexts has worked against the interests of the indigenous working classes and moreover having done it within a collapsing or indeed collapsed capitalist system, the liberal elite has allowed a new type of business environment to develop, the post industrial “free market”. This new business model relies on indebtedness to create wealthy people via mass consumption by poorer people plus bogus state investment like HS2, mass housing, welfare etc. The state itself, of course, spends billions on maintaining its own army of £100K+ consumers both employed and retired. All This government spending or waste is of course paid for by tax payers and their children’s children. The economics are bad enough but the morality which goes with this system blows a great big hole in any notion of moral convergence towards a liberal moral consensus. It promotes the sale of immorality as a fashion accessory. However, to avoid the calamity of moral conflict, moral relativism comes to the rescue for the liberal elite. They thus ignore people with appalling moral ideas that would if heard offend them, they simply don’t ask the questions.\nIn the world of the “stupid” liberal elite, no one considers the implications of a planet gobbling free market commodifying everything for consumption including families, relationships, even peoples genitalia on porn channels is marketed aggressively. TV shows like “Love Island” or “Naked Attraction” become a good recruitment film for domestic ISIS sympathisers. As abroad ISIS struggle to maintain their “rubble” age culture they see that we in the west are morally no better than them. But they would satisfy themselves that there is religiously sanctioned male authority underpinning their abuse, as opposed to the moral free for all that reflects our low moral “free market” standards. They recognise the extent of the excrement of western civilisation in a way we can’t and rather than see our Shakespeare and Mozart as reference points for Western culture they see only our “shame” and they, of course, believe they have the answer to our shame and sinfulness.\nTo the stupid liberal elite, all this is Ok. People can be free to waste their hard borrowed money on consumer tatt whilst the elite cream off our debt as income and lord it over the increasingly impoverished masses. The stupid elite doesn’t see that the middle, lower middle and working classes are in decline as more of them through indebtedness and paying for education and “care” morph imperceptibly into the new pauper class, the now fabled underclass. The underclass is a horrible term for a class created by the political elite from industrial and agricultural workers who had their jobs exported and class consciousness undermined. Debt and the immorality funded by debt, plus the underclass funded by welfare offends many who are religious or observant. Drunk feral women for example, or drunk feral men not only outrage public decency they are a rallying point for the demand for a new strict moral framework that advocates sanctions which are not only pre industrial they are almost pre Biblical. But the stupid elite doesn’t see that. They turn a blind eye and keep on forking out taxpayers cash to maintain demand and GDP.\nThe state of western culture may explain the casual way a few second and third generation immigrants of perhaps Pakistani or North African descent in 21st century Britain will refer to stonings and amputations as a way of tackling these essentially “moral” social problems. To the Elite the underclass is a class in need of health care and welfare to the intolerant religious bigot they are an irrelevant social nuisance, a nuisance to be controlled or eradicated. When confronted by the reality of their underclass the liberal elite quickly move on. No Tim Farron type interrogations of the Muslim faithful from them. It might prove them to have been at best nieve and at worst stupid, creating their “diversity” and then tolerating sexual and racial discrimination within that diversity and finally giving up any notion they understand the social and political environment they have created.\nAnd that brings us nicely to evil. Is any of this, as the lawyers would say, done with intent. Well, much of it is, unfortunately. The liberal elite will avoid any “narrative” that would question the legitimacy of the Saudi’s to buy our weapons whilst promoting with their savage technological feudal system; stonings, crucifixions and beheadings. They also know that it is the poor and increasingly the middle classes who are getting into debt either by themselves or with the connivance of the state. We have seen wars and financial crises but one thing is always clear, once debt is monetized in the hands of the wealthy it becomes their passport to a new life, a life in a sunny part of the world where morality might be strict, and far away from “Love Island” and the workless underclass but where wealth buys privilege for those who can behave themselves and can afford it. Think Blair et al.\nWithin our western culture, the elite is slowly bankrupting us, undermining our values with welfare and a lack of proper economically valuable employment or valuable social employment, destroying our planet and creating a political environment that could herald a return to discrimination, hatred and fear via polararised debate. When it happens, when the western hegemony collapses, the rich and their elites will abandon us to what ever fate befalls our once hardworking, decent and tolerant culture. Nieve stupid or evil? Probably all three.",

Like Trump, he sees himself as a saviour of the people.\nTrump boasted that he was going to give power back to the people. In the nation of ‘pork barrel’ politics, wealthy special interests, not to say the might of the industrial-military establishment and gun lobby amongst other lobbies, Trump’s ambition can only be a hollow promise at best. The problem is that people will remain locked out of the “system” being consumers of policy not producers and beneficiaries of it. The same applies to Macron.\nIn a statement, Macron claims to be able to “tackle the failed political system” and then comes up with Blairite ‘third way’ policies that will essentially liberalise the labour and financial markets that enable businesses and banks to sell debt and drive consumption to levels that will only be sustained and profitable in the medium term if work is off-shored or undertaken by migrant labour. It will be a consumption revolution but will not become a blue collar revolution, it will simply be another triumph of the state and the states mates, over the individual. The most vulnerable will suffer and then like Blair, Marcon will take to the international ‘hot air circuit’ and bullshit on behalf of the Bilderberg group. What Macron and Trump don’t get is that ‘revolution’ is not about policy but about how the state designs and delivers policy and for both men, the mechanics of the state remain unchanged. Therefore the people will continue to be ‘done to’ rather than being active participants in Blue Revolutionary change.\nSo what is going to happen in France and should the UK worry. Basically, in our view, there is no change across the channel. The French “Reds” will riot and start fires etc. The whole package of policies will disintegrate under the sheer weight of internal opposition and this will all be happening as Britain is telling the EU that unless we get a good deal from Brexit we will become an offshore tax haven to the collapsing French economy.\nMarcon and Trump both elites and with an elite’s vested interests cannot deliver the new democracy and a new post-war, and in the case of Marcon post-EU settlement. They both need to look at the system, but they won’t because the system is why they are where they are!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_decoding-structural-disadvantage-simplified/content_85.html": "Decoding Structural Disadvantage, Simplified\nWe hear the term ‘structural disadvantage’ a lot. Because of so called structural disadvantage we are encouraged to ‘take the knee’, to see the consequences of structural disadvantage in terms linked to race or maybe some other identity.\nDo people including politicians really understand structural disadvantage? You know, what the term really means. and how do they prove its existence? If asked, most will tell you it is about discrimination. This seems odd given that state organisations ‘the state structure’ is very keen to be ‘inclusive’ and ‘anti-discriminatory’. The idea therefore that the state and nation are complicit in discriminating against minorities seems a little farfetched. The law prohibits discrimination and backs this up with sanctions for discriminating. So where does the evidence come from that structural disadvantage exists and discriminates, and its racial.\nIt is certainly the case that people who are black or from other minority groups suffer the effects of structural disadvantage and when that happens is easy to call it racial discrimination thus linking structural discrimination to race alone. This does seem to be a habitual tick of the authoritarian left wing, perhaps because it provides a stick with which to beat the so-called right wing ‘establishment’. After all racial or not, structural disadvantage is maintained by the state establishment but that includes the past left wing ‘Blairite’ establishment too. Therefore, we must ask is structural disadvantage about more than racial identity, is it more about social class irrespective of race?\nBy making the claim that structural disadvantage is race based and imploring us all to take the knee in support of the disadvantaged black community, we ignore the fact that many other people who are not from ethnic minorities suffer structural disadvantage too, poor white people for example. By putting the emphasis on race as opposed to class, it allows the political establishment to maintain the class system based on wealth and privilege whilst they blame poor, white people for both their own structural disadvantage and the structural disadvantage of the black community. This is because structural disadvantage, or so the narrative goes, only affects black people. and can’t possibly affect white people because they might be poor and excluded but they are also white.\nBy claiming the effects of structural disadvantage are only linked to the colour of a person’s skin the establishment neutralise legitimate demands to tackle structural disadvantage and exclusion. If its all about race according to the privileged elite, we should just tackle racism.\nSo, if we accept that structural disadvantage is not just about race but is about disadvantage to some black people within the wider class of disadvantaged individual’s we need to find a more complex way of describing it. The idea it is about race is simply not adequate as structural disadvantage traps people of every ethnic group.\nSo, what are the mechanics of structural disadvantage then? Well, we could all come up with some ideas, welfare systems that act like traps rather than safety nets, poor education systems that do not raise aspiration, or maybe it is to do with aspiration versus entitlement. Anyone familiar with ‘posh’ people knows how super confident they are, regardless of actual ability.\nNone of these is sufficient to explain why once people slide down the social and economic system they too often slide out and struggle to get back in. They become demotivated and maybe even criminal. Tackling the consequences of structural disadvantage in the way Tony Blair did with the repot by the poverty commission identifying housing, drug and alcohol misuse or thinking and behavioural deficits has not resulted in the number structurally disadvantaged decreasing. The numbers still climb up. Ok so what does explain structural disadvantage?\nFirstly, we have a culture, still beholden to principles like just desserts, or you get what you deserve. This means that we do not really think failure is created by society and disadvantage imposed intergenerationally based on class, we typically view failure as a personal thing, and the consequences deserved. On this basis those who fail can only blame themselves.\nStrangely so established is this belief that it works with the rich too as we see those who succeed as being responsible for their success, even if their advantage is inherited, someone like Donald Trump for example. Failure is therefore not seen as arising from inherited disadvantage, but personal failure with a lot of justified adverse consequences to boot. Without being made aware of the mechanics of this process we are all prone to accept. We praise the children of famous people who become famous themselves and have ‘puff’ pieces published in the Sunday Times, and yet we can’t accept failure has a similar origin, so we condemn the failures and believe they should get their ‘just desserts’.\nSo in our western world, each of us gets our ‘just deserts’. In the criminal justice system, we do not understand why the petty offender has never risen above crime. It is the just deserts imposed on them by a society that believes they deserve to be at the bottom of the pile.\nTo add to the problems created by a general and widespread feeling about the trappings of success and failure being deserved we have another principle that adversely affects the chances of those at the bottom of societies pile and that principle is the principle of lesser eligibility.\nThere has been some attempt made to mitigate the hard application of this Victorian principle. The welfare system dovetails a little better to support those who undertake at least some work but in respect of the unemployed, the reality is different. Local housing allowances make it impossible to escape the welfare trap once homelessness becomes a feature of your exclusion. The whole system is structured to ensure that the poor who are right at the bottom of the social pile are rarely able to escape welfare. There are homelessness charities that need a ready supply of ‘clients’ to justify their existence. The interplay of housing welfare and general welfare is the most powerful example of ‘structural disadvantage’. Rather than levelling down, we pretend we can lift these people up. In the current system we cannot, we lift up their ‘helpers’. Even Michael X the notorious black activist come drug dealer noted this point.\nFinally, the last and most invisible form of structural disadvantage we at Blue Revolution call the bureaucratisation or managerialsing of leadership. In effect, the leaders we select are selected based on how well they operate within the impersonal world of the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy has a kind of ‘humanity’ built into it, but it is in the form of appraisals, reward and recognition.\nThe language of bureaucracy is structurally disadvantaging of all those who for whatever reason do not possess the language, behavioural and educational codes that gain access to this system. Whatever we term these people, outcasts, failures, ‘mavericks’ or outsiders, they are overrepresented within the minority ethnic and other groups. It would be easy to say that the system was at fault, but the ‘liberal types’ who control the system would not accept that to be the case. ‘General racism’ is given as the cause and we are all encouraged to take the knee’ or to blame white history but never to identify the bureaucratisation of leadership, particularly guilt afflicted white leadership as the problem. To correct this, we simply need to do the same thing we do with all the forms of structural disadvantage, we level down, trust people to make the right choices about who they want as their leaders and stop pandering to the idea we can level up or the state and its bureaucratic apparatus is neutral, inclusive and fair. It is not.",

The Islamic authorities say so. Read our letter to Zac Goldsmith MP.\nDear Mr Goldsmith 17 August 2019\nFor several years there has been a debate about the use of ritual slaughter and how this can be reconciled with the grizzly business of slaughtering animals as humanely as possible. The UK is said to have a good reputation for animal welfare whilst ignoring the fact that in Halal and Kosher slaughter there is no pre-stunning and animals have their throats cut whilst fully conscious. We are a small group of people some of whom identify as Marxists and we wish to offer a contribution to this troubled debate based on the reality of ritual slaughter within the Qur’an\nArguments that are used to challenge ritual slaughter refer to the welfare of the animal. For those communities for whom an uncritical acceptance of divine authority is a cultural expectation, it is unlikely a welfare argument will be persuasive. Uncritical acceptance of religious doctrine is something that in the west we are no longer familiar with. The religious doctrines of the Qur’an (called into being by the Archangel Gabriel dictating the word of God to the prophet Mohammed) and a strong sense of religious identity are often contrasted with the lack of a coherent cultural identity in the west. What is perceived by western people as a strength, creating dynamic diverse communities, may be viewed as a threat to communities who wish to retain a distinct and doctrinal identity based on their understanding of the word of God.\nThe expectation that the west uncritically accepts halal slaughter, therefore, gets combined with westerner’s desire to have ‘diversity’ within their communities and the welfare of animals gets overlooked.\nIt is in our opinion possible to encourage diversity whilst also being cognizant of the need to protect the welfare of animals during slaughter. The hygiene obligations and rituals surrounding slaughter are clearly tailored for the realities of the seventh century, hence the need to ensure animals for slaughterer is healthy so the meat to be consumed is fresh and has not been contaminated by disease or after death by animals in the wild. Once these requirements have been addressed and an animal is fit for slaughter the offering of a prayer respects the dignity of the animal about to die. It is at this point that modern ‘halal’ slaughter seems to us to part company with the traditional expectations of Islam.\nIslam requires excellence in all matters pertaining to the slaughter of animals *. Animals are a gift from Allah and their slaughter reflects rites other than just the use of prayer before slaughter and no pre-stunning. The animal must be calmed and must be slaughtered quickly and expertly with a sharp knife and without any awareness of what is likely to happen to it. It must not be slaughtered within the vicinity of other animals due for slaughter simply to avoid its own and their distress.\nSuch practices clearly reflect the Quranic expectation of small-scale ritual animal slaughter but are a requirement of Islam and therefore should be observed as halal. The industrial slaughter of cattle and sheep required today because of the greed of a consumer society is out of step with halal to such an extent, the non-use of stunning alone cannot qualify the slaughtered meat as halal and therefore the justification for no pre-stunning is totally without doctrinal foundation or justification. Indeed, pre-stunning may ‘calm’ the animal.\nOn the basis that the Qur’an requires animals to be at ease at the time of their slaughter and that industrial slaughtering is not and can never be halal within the requirements of Islam please can you consider supporting the abolition of halal slaughter except in circumstances where due to low volumes of animals being killed appropriate observance can be made of the strict rules that apply within the faith of Islam.\nBlue Revolution\n*Abu Ya’la Shaddad ibn Aws narrated the relevant hadith",

We want to scream “a plague on all your (political) houses”. But where to start? As we registered on 19th November 2017 we have only a few twitter followers. So we have to “tweet” comment to an interesting array of the self-appointed twitterocracy who whether left or right singularly miss the people’s point that the system is at best rigged and at worst broken. So with the brevity of Twitter lets pick up two or three big-ticket issues missed by the left and right and comment.\nNumber one on the left wing is the nieve belief that the economy dependent as it is on debt can fund an even more active and interventionist state. They all queue up to extoll the merits of their version of Marxism singularly failing to grasp that Marx’s proletariat was creating social and economic value which was brought into existence by the capitalist’s production methods and is then misappropriated by the capitalist. The state then takes this value back on behalf of the worker. So far so 19th century. Today the economy relies on debt to provide the services people expect, but the state top slices tax income and uses debt to ensure it can pay for itself. Nice work if you can get it.\nNow the right. Margaret Thatcher oversaw what in the 1980’s was a radical policy of selling council homes. This was and still is seen as a way of nurturing Tory voters. However, this “revolution” was tied in with relaxing the financial sector and the slow remorseless shift of work away from Britain to China and countries that paid a “world” wage level as opposed to an “unaffordable” western one. What happened was that we in the west stopped making stuff and began consuming cheap stuff made in China. The old industrial-scale manufacturing and extractive economies in the west became a “marketing and sales” economy and this has, in turn, become a kind of economic “bandit country”. Now making money, not creating value is the “supply side” and the “demand side” is consumption paid for with debt both government and private much of it backed by house price value. Thatcher wasn’t to blame she couldn’t join the dots up, but the bankers could and still are\nFinally, the context of this mess is the canvass upon which politicians try to represent the people. On the left, the solution is government jobs and more debt welfare and healthcare without a thought about final economic collapse. On the right, it is to treat the unemployable victims of the world labour market as failures and to manage the decline of their communities whilst finding ways of passing the cost of the whole sorry mess onto the people, via low wage employment, student debt, and adult social care costs paid from the estate of the deceased, oh and more debt but not as much as under Labour.\nWith both parties so spectacularly missing the point about the true nature of the British economy the only conclusion we can come to is OMG!!.",

We proposed a show similar to “Eden” some four years ago which took people from the stone age to phone age and in doing so tried to capture the “moral progress” that occurred as we gained mastery over our environment. Most fundamental to this progress are women’s rights. Channel 4’s “Eden” seems to confirm our view that when economies go wrong it is women’s rights that go to the wall first. Margaret Atwood made the same point in “The Handmaids Tale”. For an economy to have a progressive future it has to be grounded in an activity that creates real distributable value and is not simply some kind of equity release scheme operated on a global scale by a political and financial elite.\nEconomics needs explaining to ordinary people who even under old economic paradigms struggled to understand where wealth came from. The reason we believe that a new economic instruction manual is necessary is that the “new economics” is dependent on financial services and financial services rely on asset value to underpin their activities. As we saw with the 2007/8 crash if those assets suddenly reveal themselves to be worthless then we are going to be in very big trouble again.\nBut what of Mr Carney, the high priest of the “Reminers” suddenly getting all optimistic about post-Brexit Britain. To us, his optimism highlights the continuity that will be necessary post Brexit and which the EU won’t be able to dismantle. How so? Well, Britain is not a fabulously rich country we have too much debt to be wealthy in the traditional sense of the term, however, we are to the world’s investors a fabulously well-endowed country with property and land holdings worth about sixty trillion dollars.\nNow assuming that the Tories don’t skewer free movement and upset the housing and land asset inflation apple cart Britain will continue to prosper financially post-Brexit. The worlds investment dosh will still flow here! The problem for the Tories is that it was the issue of migration that was the prime reason for the working classes to vote Brexit, and we hoped that post-Brexit immigration would be curtailed (by the loss of welfare entitlements) so as to take the inflationary pressure out of the housing and land asset bubble and perhaps re balance the economy by encouraging other sectors.\nIt seems clear to us this is not going to happen. Carney’s optimism is a symptom of that. Britain will continue to rely on the Kleptocracy to fund the levers of state and pay for the publicsectocracy and the workless army of the welfare and healthcare dependent citizens who are on the books of the state.\nAs economic determinists, we believe so much flows from this economic model which is assumed to be permanent. Take away the slosh of money washing around in this model and what you have left is nothing. With this nothing will disappear all the rights and freedoms we enjoy now. Even Jeremy Corbyn won’t be able to borrow himself out of that situation there will be little of real value to borrow against.\nThe good news is it is a while off yet, but with the Western worlds house built on sand rather than rock, the end it is coming!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_should-we-destroy-values-of-equality-because-they-are-white/content_290.html": "Are we at risk of destroying values of equality because they are identified as ‘western’ values?\nThe problem with the United Nations is that it has a perspective on the world shaped by two beliefs. The first is that western nations exploited black nations economically which is by and large true and secondly that it is now time to correct that by undermining western values. The problem for the UN and the culturally illiterate white elite is that they are being encouraged to undermine western values on the back of attacking past economic inequality. The worlds current inequality is not caused by western values which seek to liberate individuals but by religion, autocracy and ignorance. Characteristics we in the west are still fighting to remove in some places.\nFirstly capitalism may have been a western ideology but it was only controlled by a minority of western people. Most white families at the height of the capitalist system, say around 1900 were exploited. There was no white privilege for them. Women didn’t have the vote and working-class men had only recently acquired it. Capitalism was an unfair system but it was capable of being made less unfair as workers became better educated and demanded rights that existed at first only for the capitalist class.\nThus the experience of workers improved as they were able to gain the vote, gain access to education, clean and safe working environments and could exercise the principles that underpinned capitalism namely contract, choice and consent.\nContract, choice and consent are the economic principles of capitalism that were slowly extended to more and more workers. It is these principles which are now under threat because the modern western elite and a growing number of nations in the developing world fail to see that whilst exploitation may have been unfair and wrong it reflected in economic terms rights we have now extended to more and more people. These economic rights have now assumed a social character and underpin ‘liberal’, personal and ‘human’ rights.\nBeing ignorant of the role of capitalism in creating individual rights is why rights are being undermined by an assault on what is seen as white western culture by the identity left-wing. Capitalism might have begun as ‘white’ culture but the economic and social rights it has created need to be extended to more communities and societies and not be undermined by crude racism based on ignorance of the role capitalism has played in liberating people of all races from cultures that enslave, discriminate and kill.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_uk-socialism-we-look-at-the-economics-of-the-many-not-the-few/content_248.html": "UK Socialism. We look at the economics of the many not the few!\nThe many not the few seems to have its origins in the 1848 Manifesto of the Communist Party and therefore gives some credibility to the claim that the most recent iteration of the Labour Party is Marxist. This suggestion is relished by the likes of John McDonnell who can’t escape from the exciting psychodrama of class war.\nIt was Karl Marx who scientifically explained the process by which all property is theft, he called it “exploitation”. Workers only had their labour power to sell. The class system required the costs of children to be covered by the worker and a surplus workforce existed which would suppress wages. Between living costs and competing with other workers, it was not possible to accumulate wealth. Together these two features of the worker’s life interfered with his desire to acquire “Property”. Workers wanted property and could, in theory, have it but the wages system made it almost impossible.\nThe property, of course, does not mean personal property (Hats, coats, furniture etc) but property that consists of valuable and tradable assets like buildings, stocks and shares and gold. The process of exploitation identified by Marx resulted in the capitalist accumulating property whilst the workers essentially paid for it. By buying labour power the capitalist owned the surplus once wages were paid and this surplus value became capital and therefore property. This is why capitalism is correctly identified as ‘unfair’ or exploitative.\nNow in Marxian terms, the “many” would be the army of workers all of whom collectively were creating the surplus value necessary to provide the capitalist with his property. The few would be the capitalists who were benefitting from this “rigged” system as John Mc Donnell puts it. It’s not so much rigged… It just is what it is!\nOthers who benefitted from this system would be the army of bankers, politicians and lawyers and other Pettit bourgeoisie who were able to gain payment from capitalists by reinforcing the expectations and interests of the system, courts upholding property rights for example. Upholding the interests of capital against the interests of workers.\nCapitalism is inherently unfair and socialism was seen by many as the brief collective action necessary to enable the worker to claw back a greater slice of the product of his or her labour power. So far so good. A coherent idea framed within the context of the mid 19th century.\nFrom the 1900’s onwards the march of socialism began to address some of the unfairness within the capitalist system. By the end of WWII it was possible to envisage a “socialist state”. A landslide Labour victory after WWII resulted in the nation-state having the power to collectively redistribute the surplus value hitherto appropriated by capitalists, but this time in favour of everyone. The welfare state was born and there was a wealth re-distributive programme and Nationalisations.\nThis trajectory from 1848 to about 1948 delivered socialism or as near as damn it and thus, in theory, liberated the workers from “exploitation” by capitalists.\nTo be fair to capitalism the economic principles underpinning it which we at Blue Revolution simply describe as “Contract, Choice and Consent” have not only endured over the last hundred years they have taken on a “social character”. So we now enjoy these principles as a matter of routine in all aspects of our lives. In this respect, the efforts of the Suffragettes, Labour Party and the more recent coalition and Conservative governments have achieved excellent results promoting enhanced rights for women and a huge number of previously discriminated against minorities.\nUnlike social progressiveness, however, the economic unfairness inherent within the capitalist system was not really addressed by the post-war Labour and subsequent governments. Indeed the failed efforts of Labour to deliver for the working class needs some analysis because “socialism” did not “liberate” workers in any economic sense.\nBy the mid-1990’s the Labour Party’s appetite to deliver socialism was in full retreat. Unless one understood what was going on one would be forgiven for thinking “capital” had won. This is still the narrative of right-wing publications and those quick to look to the failure of the old USSR, but it is not so!\nCapitalism had in the West succumbed to its inevitable destiny of collapse by around the mid-1980’s. The racketeering free market was engineered by governments and banks to keeps its corpse twitching on the slab for as long as possible. Put simply capitalisms failure was because “surplus value” the holy grail of capitalism, socialism and beyond, was in mature western capitalist economies, non-existent and workers were now under the direct or indirect pay of the government and taxpayer who had no surplus value to work with, just debt.\nIn the period after WII state industries struggled and then failed to deliver surplus value to the nation, and in too many cases, the nation was subsidising the nationalised worker. This is not how the process is supposed to work. From Steel Yards to Coal Mines the workers were effectively taking on the taxpayer in industrial disputes and demanding a higher slice of taxpayer subsidy. This was the case with all the industrial monopolies and some of the utilities. This was the precursor to the “Thatcher” reforms and privatisations. Even Marx recognised that the rapid growth of capital was an essential element of the liberation of the worker. But by the 1970’s that capital growth based on surplus value was in reverse.\nThere are two possible theories why no surplus value was created. One is that the workers in failing to identify the nation as having the ownership of capital took on the “management” as surrogate “capitalists” and destroyed their and our nations industrial base. An alternative and the one favoured by us at Blue Revolution is that Western capitalism, even state capitalism in the form of nationalised industries, were by the 1970’s unprofitable and doomed to failure and eventual closure due to global economic factors and in particular wage and pension costs.\nWestern industrial workers were too expensive to employ and pension. Working classes elsewhere in the world could make the stuff the West needed and the “surplus value” would come by the interplay of global capital and global labour. This phase is our modern economic history saw ‘expensive’ workers being cast aside in favour of Chinese employees and others. Workers saw industries shipped abroad in crates and their children, intended to replace them in the labour market, pushed out onto a diet of welfare and healthcare. The State in the form of the taxpayer picked up the tab. The ghastly word ‘underclass” fails to capture the reality of these people as victims of the failure of domestic capitalism and socialism to deal with global conditions. And the 1970’s model won’t work this time either.\nIt is difficult to see how Labour will sort this issue out with its programme of nationalisations and debt. The whole world economy has become a machine for papering over the cracks of the failure of Western capitalism to recover profitability sufficient to pay for its State social and other obligations. It now costs the nations of the West trillions to make it look like capitalism still works here.\nThe substitute for western capitalism the “free-market” system requires state expenditure and obscene levels of personal indebtedness to maintain aggregate demand for products made elsewhere. Labour will sadly add to the toxic mix of debt and declining productivity with their parochial economic policies which can’t address significant global factors and would leave workers outside their financial comfort zone. This isn’t a thumbs up for Remain either, only Brexit gives the freedom to escape debt.\nSo back to the original point above. Who are the many and who are the few? Sadly within the current economic paradigm just as in the 1970’s the many will be the hard-pressed indebted taxpayers and the few the state political and economic elites and hangers-on. Not quite what Marx and Engles had in mind! They saw socialism and its aftermath as beneficiaries of global capital not sadly inheritors of the national debt!",

We are fatter and have chronic conditions such as diabetes. In the past, we would smoke and die prematurely, we would have heart attacks and die prematurely. We would die before we suffered from dementia. Today we are capable of being kept alive long beyond the point at which we are able to maintain ourselves, and we become a burden. We become a burden on someone the issue is on whom should we become that burden.\nMrs May was trying to ensure that on behalf of the taxpayer she got some of the costs of adult social care back by getting homeowners and those with an estate to contribute to their care post-mortem so to speak. The amount one could pass on to relatives was raised to £100,000 but there was no cap so a person in need of expensive care could see all but £100,000 of their estate being gobbled up in care costs. The furore seemed to take her and the Tories by surprise. However, it shouldn’t have done. Like student debt, the policy is intended to relieve the state of a financial burden but in passing the cost on to the person in need, it becomes a case of letting the state off the hook whilst over one generation removing an element of financial support for the next generation, which in turn burdens the taxpayer at a later date. A cap on the amount the state would expect the individual to pay quickly followed.\nThe reason we are concerned about this whole situation is that it reveals how the state is enthusiastic to withdraw funding and therefore responsibility for social support, (as it has done with higher education another related issue here too) a responsibility that it has taken on relentlessly since the end of the war. It has altered Britain, changed the nature of the family and now finds itself unable to discharge its responsibilities. As the state withdraws so it is the poorer end of society that suffers. Without the capping, and perhaps even with the cap, within one generation, there will be fewer elderly people wealthy enough to make a contribution as their inheritance would have been spent on their parent’s social care. We thus create a pauper class over time. This is intolerable but would be understandable if the state itself didn’t squander millions on maintaining its own antiquated structures.\nBefore the state pulls out of paying for essential services it should look at how it can reconfigure itself so it uses modern technology to eradicate ‘top salaries’ and develops alternative ways of delivering essential services at a reduced cost to the taxpayer. Our programme is the only programme, contained within our manifesto, that offers this approach as opposed to the approach of other parties which is simply to tax more or pass on costs to those in most need but who are least able to pay as the poorest get it free anyway.",

Yes people are getting rich and some people are getting jobs but the elephant in the room is that too many of those jobs are based directly or indirectly on debt and too few people are the recipients of the debt once it has been transformed into income by the state or banking system, so only a few, including politicians get rich.\nBonuses to house builders, EU bureaucrats Vice Chancellors of British Universities and state employees on over £100K per year all have a stake in taxpayer-funded debt. QE and the issuing of government Bonds assist the profitability of the banking system. No one is going to challenge the status quo when the status quo, the taxpayer-funded global debt model, is so lucrative to our “elite”.\nWhat is called “capitalism” today owes more to debt than capital (capital is economic value stolen from workers by capitalist’s, getting workers into debt to pay “capitalists” is not capitalism) but the elite doesn’t want anyone to know that.\nWithout the West’s governments taking tax from and thus indebting the poor taxpayer for centuries the system would have collapsed about a decade ago. The 2007/8 banking crisis was the most recent iteration of capitalisms terminal illness. Others collapses have been prevented by war or re-engineering the system as happened in the 1980’s.\nThe problem is that when the 1980’s collapse began the world was global so the Elite could export expensive work to China making the maximum profit from low production costs and stable sale prices at home. As prices stayed stable so inflation was stable but work was becoming a low skill and low pay issue so families needed subsidy and that comes from taxpayers too. So the bottom end of the economy is being subsidised and the elite’s and bankers are being continually bailed out as well.\nInitially, in 07/08 the bankers had to be bailed out…the systems death throes would have had a devastating social as well as catastrophic economic impact so immediate collapse had to be avoided. However rather than have a revolutionary overhaul of the whole system and staunch the excessive wealth and waste inherent within the elite’s crony economy, the state not only stepped in to stop the collapse, it continues to subsidize the whole “capitalist” system (banking, State and consumption). There is no one who is going to come forward to change this unless a quiet ballot based revolution takes place and those who can live on a realistic wage start to re-engineer the whole system for the benefit of everyone. Corbyns tax and spend is grist to the mill for the global elite and Farage’s sucking up to the EU shows just how far the global elite will go to consolidate their advantage over the rest of us.\nBlue Revolution is a quiet revolution, it’s a means by which ordinary people can get in on the political act by not having to go through the ideological indoctrination of the party system.

Every politician and pundit have identified the problem of the West’s lack of a narrative to counter-terrorism. The confusion over progressive values is that progressive values involve tolerating too readily regressive values such as anti Semitism or misogyny. In confusion over how to deal with primitive hate values are the so-called progressive left, an alliance of people who are united in hate of what is known as capitalism but which is, in reality, just a debt-funded “free market”. A free market that underpins the Wests freedoms.\nThe groups who hate this system either hate it because it confers rights to minorities they object to but for whom markets have developed to serve their needs, for example, the gay community. Or conversely, they don’t understand their own ideological confusion that the rights they enjoy, they enjoy because of the free market system they hate. This paradox is particularly marked on the left and partly explains Corbyn’s strange collection of incompatible ideological bedfellows.\nThis lack of coherence allows a moral fog to descend on the whole issue of individual rights and cultural expectations and confuses our understanding of the causes of the hatred of the West and thus impedes the West’s strategy or narrative for dealing with it. The modern liberal mind can’t square the circle.\nOk, so we will have a go. The West owes its existence like it or not, to capitalism, and in particular the 18th century and the codification of laws that created the legal freedom to contract choose and consent. All necessary for capitalism to work.\nBefore capitalism, we were bonded to masters. After capitalism, we were in a legal sense free people, the workers in the capitalist machine. The legal freedoms we acquired then and have extended since creating equality in law for minorities. These are missing from many of the world’s cultures today, particularly Islamic ones where gender, caste, tribe or wealth and status institutionalize discrimination. In these cultures, there is too often no right to contract freely to “follow your dreams”. They are pre-capitalist and pre-industrial. You only have to look at the culture of abuse and discrimination in Saudi Arabia to see how the pre-capitalist pre-industrial society works.\nSo the narrative for the West is to acknowledge the central role capitalism has played in creating our freedoms and whilst capitalism has its faults accept we owe our freedom to it and take pride in that. Even socialists can do this because without the productive energy of capitalism there would be no socialism. The west should then-champion the narrative of contract choice and consent and shame the bigots of whatever cultural hue into seeing themselves as regressive and at best 18th as opposed to the 21st century.\nThe bigots know that if you destroy the free market or we destroy it with debt, pre-industrial morals of control, coercion, and corruption become coherent. They the terrorists are trying to terrorize us back to their world so once again their values make sense.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_introduction-to-our-soon-to-be-published-new-manifesto/content_210.html": "Introduction to our soon to be published new manifesto.\nDear Voter,\nHave you heard of the expression: ‘when you need something to believe in, start with yourself?’ This is a comment often cited, and, at its very essence, is ‘truth’. Basically, if you want something badly enough, then you have to do it yourself; you cannot rely on others to accomplish what you want to achieve.\nThis mind-set transposes from day-to-day activities to the world of ‘politics’, be it at a national, regional or local level. The attitude amongst the majority of people on the electoral roll amounts to ‘Oh not again’, ‘just get on with it’, or ‘my vote doesn’t change a single thing, so why bother?’ Hence, low turn-outs at elections are an inevitability, which benefits those with a vested interest. It is that ‘elite’ who, through an assumed apathy and distrust of the existing political system shown by the voters, are able to be elected by default and thus become very comfortable as a democratically elected representative who does not have the support of the majority of voters but revels on those who did not turn out to vote, because of a total distrust in the current system.\nOf course, under any democratic system, it is your right to vote as you choose. This is not under dispute. What is questionable, however, is this: if you vote for a traditional party under the English electoral system, is your voice really being heard? If you reflect on that question, are you satisfied that you are making an impact? Or, is there a doubt in your mind: a voice that says: ‘my opinion counts for nothing: my vote perpetuates the status quo where those with vested interests are able to pursue their personal interests behind the guise of a democratic election?\nThis is why the average person on the street; the office worker, the teacher, the shelf-stacker, the unemployed, the homeless, the nurse, the refuse disposal operatives, to give them the politically correct description, otherwise known as dustbin men guys, the student, in fact anyone, has no real faith in traditional politics, or even dare I say, in new politics. This needs to be corrected: quickly and without delay, because otherwise we, as a population, are prepared to be consumed by a system which does not care for us, does not appreciate our feeling and perceptions, but chooses to ignore them at their convenience. And do you know what: I accept that premise; ‘I get it’. I have often felt that living in a particular location, necessarily implies that however I vote won’t make a single jot of difference, so why bother voting: nothing will change despite my opinion, so quite frankly I can’t be bothered.\nAre you correct in your assumptions? Once, I would have said ‘Yes’: now, I say ‘No’. Why has this shift come about? It is quite simple: I have become aware of The Blue Revolution.\nIt is important from the outset to state that this organisation is not a political party in the accepted understanding of the phrase. In essence, it is a political ‘movement’. My first concern was an incorrect implication I arrived that: ‘blue’ being the colour of the Conservative Party, which indeed it is, just as ‘Red’ is synonymous with the Labour Party and\n‘yellow’ is the colour adopted by the Lib-Dems. In the instance of The Blue Revolution the colour refers to ‘blue collar people’: the anonymous person often quoted as being Mr or Mrs Average, who are disregarded as being not within the determinants of ‘need’ and also not within the realms of the ‘wealthy’ who, frankly, are not concerned with everyday issues anyway given their immense wealth.\nThe Blue Revolution is an entirely new concept in political thinking. Here is an approach to politics which welcomes political thought from any stance. Here is an approach which can totally restructure the accepted norms of political interaction. Here is an organisation which accepts and incorporates the input from the electorate without assumptions drawn. Here is a way of thinking which breaks through the traditional divide and welcomes views from any perspective and appreciates the contributions from a diversity of inputs, rather than disregarding them without any fear of retribution, since they are safely ensconced within the establishment that adopts a ‘laissez-faire’ conceptualisation.\nThe Blue Revolution has, at its essence, a goal of reconciliation: It accepts that people are disillusioned with politics at whatever level, be it national, regional or local. How many times have you heard expressions such as this with regard to Brexit: ‘please, just get on with it and stop arguing?’ We accept the premise that ‘from little acorns, great Oaks grow’. We are not going to take over the leadership of the UK parliament for the foreseeable future: probably never; most definitely never.\nWhat we can do, however, is make a start. By that, we mean on the local level, here in Boston.\nWe can make certain promises. We cannot be ‘whipped’ into a traditional party political system. That is because we are apart from that ideology: we are free-thinking individuals who will take on board the opinions from any political viewpoint, in full acceptance of what has been divulged to us.\nWe can make a difference: a ‘real’ difference and here is the reason why. We will address the issues that affect you, as a resident of Boston, but without political confines. Whatever you think is a positive about our town which needs highlighting, or indeed a negative which needs investigation and relevant action, The Blue Revolution could be in a position to respond to you in a way that traditional party politics cannot do, especially in a Borough Council election, when one has to consider whether national party alliances have anything relevant to add to the local concerns and issues relating to our town.\nWe, as an organisation, rather than a pre-determined labelled political party, would very much appreciate your support in our journey to ‘question’ what is accepted. We will attempt to do this in the spirit of inclusion, as opposed to exclusion, which the existing system necessarily encapsulates and encourages.\nBelieve in yourself; question your opinions, and support your local Blue Revolution candidate. You know you want to, so here is your chance.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_america-and-revolution-a-marxist-perspective/content_161.html": "America and revolution? A Marxist perspective.\nWithin Marxism, there is the concept of the ‘contradiction’. A contradiction is a precursor for revolution. They reflect a growing awareness by politically active people that the prevailing economic system does not work and that it needs to be ‘burst asunder’. Bursting a prevailing system asunder ushers in a radical change of direction, usually but not exclusively for the better.\nFeudalism to capitalism was one such revolution arising out of the view of the growing sixteenth-century middle class that aristocracy and being born to status and privilege was an illegitimate way of ordering society. In the seventeenth-century, it was burst asunder and replaced with a system that empowered the middle class, allowing them the freedom to exploit the working class to acquire what became known as capital. Capital is the accumulation of wealth based on profits made by exploiting working people. Basically, exploitation is paying workers a lot less money than they make for the capitalist as profit.\nContradictions, therefore, create a revolution. It does not have to be violent. But change does need to happen, for change not to happen means people are being oppressed and the revolution when it comes will be more explosive than it would have been if the powerful had yielded some ground.\nThe western world is in the grip of a growing awareness by ordinary people that they have high levels of economic uncertainty and low levels of political power. The democracies of the western world were set up in the eighteenth century to protect the interests of the capitalist class. The model, therefore, is top-down. Power comes from the top and not from the base. It would have been considered ridiculous to have empowered working people in the eighteenth century so the systems of government in the west do not allow this. Voting in elections does not really empower people, they are forced to vote for parties that probably do not represent their real values and opinions.\nIn Britain, Brexit was a successful revolution. It happened because of a contradiction, a growing awareness by ordinary people that a remote and an elite, self-regarding bureaucratic superstate could not represent them politically. So, the British people by a narrow margin voted to leave the European Union. This was the last thing the elite in the British parliament wanted, so they oppressed the people with project fear. Brexit was achieved because the Conservative party woke up to the fact that to ignore the Brexit vote would be political suicide. Self-preservation saved both the country and the Conservative Party. Britain, a wealthy but small nation is once again fully independent. Apart from a few naive Blairites Britain has moved on. The fact that Parliament continues to exercise top-down supreme power over the people and potentially over the Government, will, of course, cause problems in the future. This demands a new political settlement that takes democracy onto the next progressive level.\nNow America has a similar political set up to Great Britain. It too is top-down and has two main parties which vie for power. Like the British parliament, it is based on attacking and defending policies. It too delivers election results that may not represent the views of the mass of ordinary workers. Joe Biden has been described as ‘woke’. Woke ideology promotes and politicises identity over and above class or ‘lived reality’, so the clash that created Brexit in the UK will be played out in the US as a clash between a confederation of ordinary workers, to whom, somewhat perversely the billionaire Donald Trump spoke, and the woke intellectuals and public service workers for whom identity is a safer basis for revolution than class.\nTackling the rights of a few preoccupied with their identities not only appeals to the ‘woke’ ego but it does not require much thinking and is avoidant of the real problems in America which are class not identity-based. The problem for America and Americans’ however is unlike the UK the confederation of opponents of the new ‘woke’ political establishment self-identify as an armed militia and militias are sanctioned by the US constitution. The Militias’ in America were sanctioned for two reasons, firstly to mobilise in the event of Britain attempting to re-take their ex-colony in the eighteenth century, and then secondly to clip the wings of an over-powerful federal government. The former risk is now non-existent but with a ‘woke’ president and vice president, the risk of civil disobedience will almost certainly increase.\nTo prevent problems caused by a clash between the working people and the state needs a complicated answer but it is essentially the same argument Blue Revolution propose for the UK, namely reducing the absolute power of the central government and parliament by empowering the people within a legal framework which unlike the current constitution increases the levels of political legitimacy. The issues around poverty and health will alongside increased gun control have the power of the people backing them.\nI do not know whether America will experience civil disorder bordering on civil war but in Marxist terms, the contradictions are clearly there between the mass of working people and their state, moreover, it is the same in every politically mature free-market economy the world over.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_islamophobia-and-the-challenge-of-accepting-difference-on-all-sides-we-avoid-ducking-the-issues/content_353.html": "Islamophobia and the challenge of accepting difference on all sides. We avoid ducking the issues!\nComplicated but we sensitively pick our way through the issues. But no holds barred. The western world and Islam have totally differing values and expectations and there is no point in pretending otherwise. The western world, shaped by the Enlightenment and then the slow relentless march of progress from feudalism through capitalism to the debt funded and amoral “free market” contrasts with a faith still in many ways wedded to traditional notions of gender, tribe and caste. The “free market” is the response to the collapse of capitalism. It maintains the capitalist systems ability to create wealth and concentrate it into a few lucky hands but it extends the commodification of the proletarian as having only his labour to sell allowing anyone to sell anything about themselves, free of moral restrictions and constraints. The wealth generated by the free market is, unlike its capitalist forerunner, largely debt derived. This makes the free market doubly amoral and utterly dependent on government and taxpayer to maintain it.\nThis system we call secular western-ism. It is a western hegemonic structure that is promoted by corporations, banks and governments and leads to behaviour that in any other time or place would be seen as utterly intolerable. Whilst in the West we go on carousing and living on a diet of self-interest and greed in places like Saudi Arabia people loose their lives for living like we do in the west unless of course, they are well-connected. This is particularly true for women as in Islam the basic differences are not “class” but gender. Moral relativism fails women as it does not evaluate culture on any moral basis but accepts moral equivalence. However, for us, “class” is more significant than gender and class-based social progress underpins our progress and determines the freedoms we enjoy male or female gay straight or whatever.\nWhilst the observant Muslim quietly practices their faith they promote through their devotions and their dress a social structure that has no link to the class based evolution of western culture. The treatment of women in Islam (which is theological in character) represents a period which has not experienced the evolution of women’s rights from male chattel to proletarian in her own right and hence to her liberation from male oppression as a man’s equal in the labour market (whatever the morally relative feminists of the left might argue). This reality affects perceptions and gives rise to what is called “Islamophobia”. Ask any person who has not been schooled in Western liberal guilt what they think of Muslims and all too many will express hostile opinions. For ordinary people particularly women the differences cannot be ignored or argued away with platitudes. The differences are raw and frighten the Western person who has no experience of cultures that practice overt culturally determined control which is gender, or sexuality based.\nSo what we have is a clash of phobias. Islamophobia versus Secularphobia. The latter being the observant Muslim’s fear of us. And fear our culture they should in its amoral form just as we should fear them their observance of a way of life unreformed by the Enlightenment and capitalism.",

However whilst from mankind’s early beginnings the birth pains of civilisation have been characterised by economic growth through conquest and the acquisition of economic value by force, the achievement of peace through ever larger and larger areas of dominion by one nation or set of values over another will have a natural peaceful end point within the next two hundred years.\nOnce all societies and empires understand the importance of adopting a means of production which maximises the amount of value created for the benefit of all people so more natural as opposed to economic groups will begin to re assert themselves. In this sense Scottish nationalism is an example, there are many others all over Europe.\nTo be a Nation as opposed to a rag tag and bob tail bunch of bloodthirsty psychopaths who steal value created by others and more often than not waste or destroy it, you need to be able to run an economy that produces its own value and allocates it with general consent. The alternative is to be either ISIS a failed state or the Mafia.\nThis process is basically what happened with the British Empire. It was successful at establishing an economic model that moved countries from tribalism to a form of feudalism under autocratic British control using Capitalism as the means of production. It was a small step from that to a vanguard of leaders envisaging the possibility of independence by using the model of capitalist industrial production (more often than not nationalised) to secure the wealth necessary to support the nation. All Capitalist and post industrial countries rely on Contract, Choice and Consent at every social and economic level. This is what protects their people and allows them to safely trade with others who share the same or nearly the same values. It is why women have been liberated over the last hundred years and other “lifestyles” have started to be accepted. Some faiths find it easier to fit in with this economic model than others but to succeed economically all nations will have to adapt and the west will have to tackle the absurdity of what we call secular westernism; basically taking the market system too far.\nOnce this point of shared social and economic values is reached there is nothing illogical about wanting to consolidate to a smaller independent identity (Scottish, Welsh Basque, Kurd or even English etc). The critical thing is not the national identity, it is the ability to recognise the values of Contract, Choice and Consent and therfore the ability of the economy to sustain it’s people. Contract, Choice and Consent protect people from each other and from government they also provide a framework for enabling individuals, communities and countries to grow their own social and economic value.\nIf there is one failure of the west in its response to everything it has or has not achieved in the Middle East it is that at no time did any one stop to think…..How ready are these countries to begin a life of social and economic independence free of the yoke of Saddam…. (substitute your own Middle east despot)?\nThe reality closer to home is that neither Europe nor in the US the “states” need the level of overarching “federal”control to which they are subject. With the basics principles of society and economics shared so widely (Contract, Choice and Consent) people should be allowed to go out and produce social and economic value unimpeded by big government. People are frustrated with western Governments; perhaps the surplus of government and the shortage of opportunities explains why.\n08.02.16 From Dagenham in the 1660’s to Dewsbury today ‘Socialisms’ appalling legacy of its treatment of women goes on.\nSome time over Christmas we seem to remember a very uplifting interview with Malala Yousafzai and another young female who was utterly inspirational. Both had experienced untold setbacks largely due to their gender (Malala being victim of an attempted assassination by some dustbowl fanatics let us not forget) both wanted to make a massive contribution to society through education (we think it was medicine but both were clearly articulate so it could have been politics).\nThe next item on the news programme was a depressing piece about British drunks at Christmas. Girls with no clothes on rolling around drunk, fighting and vomiting. The “pride” of British manhood similarly divested of dignity rolling around too. Its a good job the prospect of total war is now unlikely as with modern British youth as our front line we would be ………..well you know what we mean.\nNow we make this juxtaposition to emphasise that in our experience at a blue revolution we can have nothing but total admiration for Muslim girls and women. When they take a job on be it work or childcare they do it well and uncomplainingly. These people who could offer so much to Britain, improving our way of life, are according to a group of them who represent Muslim women in the Labour Party, being systematically discriminated against. Its as though Britain (or perhaps the Labour Party) were some dusty outpost somewhere where women are seen and not heard. The response to this from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to emphasise the fantastic treatment women receive from Labour.\nWell we have explored this issue of Labour’s treatment of women before and concluded that whilst in government the Labour Party “gamed” the welfare system to encourage single parenthood amongst the most vulnerable. As far as we at a blue revolution are concerned this is “ideologically” odd. Women, like men, are essentially factors of economic production or consumption these days, at least that is how socialists are supposed to see it; “workers” rather than biological agents of traditional reproduction, subsidized by the government on behalf of the free market, as opposed to paid for by the free market itself which can no longer afford to do it.\nThe Labour party view of women seems to be that they are pre destined to reproduce, so welfare must of course be available. This opinion does not apply to middle class Labour women who’s job it is to support their less articulate “sisters” by protecting welfare. Whereas the “lower social orders” are subsidized simply to reproduce in a moral vacuum it seems the Muslim female Labour Party activist has to overcome not just the pressure to marry and to reproduce but prejudice within her own community discouraging her involvement in politics. A good question at the next round of University Muslim Society presentations on “women in Islam” would be……can a woman be a Labour Party local councillor?\nToo many Muslim men it seems don’t appreciate mature women with sensible opinions who may wish to offer a sound view about life in Britain today. Too many Muslim men it seems would prefer women, legs spread on the top shelf on their newsagents (have you noticed how many newsagents run by Muslim men sell top shelf porn?) or stuck at home listening to outbursts from sons fathers and brothers about the drunken promiscuousness of western women. With more Muslim men being imprisoned today in Britain (08/02/16) for abusing vulnerable teenagers, the pathetic Labour party should stand four square behind Muslim women and not go into the usual confused neurotic cultural meltdown that servs the interests of women’s liberty very poorly indeed.\n“Socialism” and the Trades Unions have an appalling record of standing up to women’s rights. In the 1960’s in Dagenham, women’s wages were kept low with the connivance of the Trades Unions to allow the Ford motor company to increase men’s wages. When the equal pay act came in Ford closed manufacturing plants and laid people off because production was unaffordable.\nToday Muslim women are being marginalised by a powerful clique of males in the Labour party (male Muslim Councillors and activists predominantly) who would prefer them to put up and shut up, and again just like in the 1960’s it is with the connivance of the male left. Where is the new Barbara Castle to sort these pathetic men out. And that includes you Jez!\n11.02.16 Working at weekends. Is that really what the Drs strike is all about.\nIt seems odd that with the deal on offer the Doctors are so unhappy. Perhaps it is just that for some Public Sector workers in general and Junior Doctors in particular “Saturday and Sunday remain special”. Is this a “class” issue; after all beyond a certain point in the social hierarchy working weekends without serious compensation is seen as a sign of being low down the social strata (Mc job territory). Or is it the inevitable result of doctors being the most meritocratic of professional groups (possibly only tipped by RAF fighter pilots).\nOr is it as we would argue both of the above, combined with the fact that just as Mines and the miners were the Barons of 1980’s industrial conflicts the NHS provides a similar “battleground” today and the Junior Doctors are at the willing “vanguard” of the fight. Knights and Dames of the bash the Tories and their austerity campaign.\nThis campaign is however an example of how the “Publicsectocracy” * either uses or expects the Government to maintain generous standards of employment and pay levels in the Public sector. Standards which would be considered unprofitable, or unaffordable in the private sector. We know the NHS is excellent and it is cheaper then health care elsewhere, but if the ultimate employers i.e. the public want a 7 day a week NHS, they are entitled to have it as long as standards of care are maintained.\nThe whole argument is lost or won on who pays for the service and what do they want from it (the contract is with the public). It is almost the Google tax deal in reverse i.e. this is how much I will do and when I will do it and that is how much you will have to pay!!!\nAt many levels in the Uk public sector and beyond we see the largely unconscious but ultimately autocratic impulse of privileged public sector employee groups (from EU technocrats to local council Chief Execs) trying to preserve their positions at the expense of the taxpayer and or service user or front line worker. Why no one has spotted this contradiction in the system and why the debate continues along the lines of 1980’s industrial relations namely the government bashing a “vulnerable yet valuable” group of public sector workers, is baffling. In Marxian terms if the junior Doctors “raised their consciousness” they would see the real story beneath their own very well articulated propaganda.\nThe NHS and Junior Doctors issue is therfore really an argument between taxpayers, service users and a largely well paid, well educated and privileged group of public sector workers. The Government is simply trying to deliver what the public rather than the public sector actually want.\n* Those public servants in a position of privilege and control over those who pay them, namely taxpayers. A weak government is their best friend\n18.02.16 Are the white female child victims of Muslim grooming gangs victims of two flawed cultures or just one?\nSarah Vine in the Daily Mail writes about the latest batch of men of Pakistani origin sentenced to up to 20 years in custody for raping a 13 year old vulnerable white girl in a Northern British town (Daily Mail 12 Feb 16). Any one who has met men like this knows that too many (not all by any means) carry an arrogance and sense of gender and cultural superiority which is only matched by their embarrassing lack of intelligence and education.\nFor these men the girl who was their victim was like too many other young white northern women, worthless. She wasn’t born to be sexually active at a young age, and therefore vulnerable to appalling abuse. This girl may not have been too intelligent or well educated she may have had a number of health and mental health issues and was, to coin an all too common phrase today; a vulnerable person. Little to look forward to in life, but worst of all she was a female with no moral worth. Islam reveres women and mothers in particular; note the men’s entreaty to their mothers. However women and indeed men who are who are put on a pedestal generally come to harm when they fall from the pedestal. It is worse when such beliefs are embedded culturally.\nWe have spoken about certain beliefs within Islam and how these beliefs relate to women; often described as “the role of women in Islam”. The higher the pedestal the harder the fall. So we have a uber masculine culture fuelled with a belief that men are able to prey on women and girls who are simultaneously both desired and repellent. Such is the contradiction inherent in sexual desire when it is borne of lust not love.\nThe ideology of masculine entitlement coupled to the culture of blaming the fallen female (even if she is a vulnerable child) meets the scourge of what we call secular westerism. The culture of secular westernism defines people by what they have be it money, looks, status or any one of a number of shallow inhuman characteristics.\nSecular westernism breaks up families, causes people to procreate with little regard for their offspring, promotes governments to paper over societal cracks with “agencies”to make up for social deficits all paid for by borrowing and spending recklessly. It is a culture that has unrestrained freedom at its core but it lacks the kind of safe moral dimension which creates opportunities and protects freedoms and by doing this protects people. Into this culture our vulnerable northern females are born; the prey to be predated on by the entitled hateful masculine predetor.\nThe crisis in Keighley in Yorkshire is a crisis of two cultures both capable of much good but both perverted by the reality of secularism in the UK. It is sad that these young girls were not brought up to see their role as economic as well as social. Were not brought up to see that sex is not a tradable commodity, that sex does not deliver “love” but is a behaviour that outside of loving relationships is simply a proxy for hate and abuse. The west needs to examine secular westernism and whether it is from a faith based perspective or even Darwinism to see its contradictions. Any society which creates such low self regard in its young and makes them vulnerable to predators is not a society that has any real chance of successful long term survival. Trying to make good the damage done to the young with health provision is no solution, in fact it reflects the chronic nature of the problem. Unless we turn things around we are going to end up in a bad place. Just wait and see.\n22.02.16 Now we have an EU deal how Millennium proof and Internationalist is it?\nThe problem with “the human condition” is that we always think our existential period is limited to the one we are living in now. Consequently we tend to try to hard and preserve the status quo. People in the past did not have out technology or ability to be almost universally literate in the west and therefore were not able to look back and think forward and reflect on mistakes of the past and how they can be avoided in the future.\nThe ideology of the world needs to be forged around trade and we in the UK have so much to gain as does the rest of the world from the Uk leaving the EU and re joining the rest of the world in free and productive commerce. Africa, China India and the Middle East would be better off with a critical friend like an independent UK. Shaping values via trade with a contractual equivalence lost within the EU behemoth. We need to seed, weed and feed the world and Africa has to be helped to provide the worlds food value as the west in particular stops producing affordable food and continues to manufacture debt based wealth. In a world like this contractual arrangements around food production need to be understood by those with enough land to continue to produce food in sufficient quantities to feed the world.\nThe issue of the UK in the EU is relevant here; Europe is too complex to negotiate deals with individual African nations. There too many vested interests in the farming sector. The EU is very big government spanning numerous countries and cultural and economic expectations. The EU is doubly burdened by being governed by an army of bureaucrats, a collection of well remunerated people who, look every bit the feudal overlord, whilst around them chaos waste and squander reigns. As we at a Blue Revolution call them, the “Publicsectocracy”. They promote the status quo in a quickly changing world. Their survival depends on the status quo and the rest of the continent including the UK suffers for it but ultimately everyone else in the world suffers too.\nUnder the umbrella of the EU individual members have welfare policies which combined with open boarder policy or free movement and this combined with the western powers naïve adventures in North Africa and the Middle East mean that at the political and personal level life looks pretty chaotic. A combination of entitlement, expectation plus cultural arrogance and misunderstanding make toxic the effects of economic and refugee migration.\nTo cope with Europes uncertainty the EU promotes a regressive model for the future. With Chaos regressive models always seem to gain traction. Fascism in the Middle East (Libya, Iraq etc.) and North Africa (Egypt) slides back towards tribalism, Socialism or the “mixed economies” of Europe consolidate into the EU a form of techno feudalism as a counterweight to the fears of …..well almost everything. Russia has its new Czar and America has a Trump, all playing the various regressive cards of discrimination, blame and sabre rattling . The world looks slow, protectionist and regressive but the EU is part of the problem, not part of the solution.. The EU might seem like the answer but it is we are sorry to say simply a reassuring placebo that is swallowed out of fear and anxiety\nSo the point has been made here that the consolidation of EU is a natural response to a number of fears of a political and economic nature (mature economies and societies running out of steam, running out of new ideas, protecting the status of the publicsectocracy, advanced societies which are starting to corrode socially). Far from solving these problems the EU has created at vast expense its bureaucracy to manage Europe’s decline.\nThe Blue revolution is at its core about three things….Contract, Choice and Consent as the basis for freedom and moral responsibility. As any dust bowl Islamist what he thinks about consent and choice and you will see how they underpin only free societies and free economies.\nSo to is it with welfare, Contract underpinning welfare based economic or social effort…The notions of Contract, Choice and Consent, are the gift that we in the “free market” west have inherited from capitalism and with some slight cultural modifications including some necessary softening with “socialism” after the last world war in the UK (necessary then but not so much now), Contract Choice and Consent has allowed the world to speak together with the language of trade and commerce thus escaping tribalism, feudalism, Imperialism, discrimination and oppression.\nThe concepts of Contract Choice and Consent protects everyone. If the relationship between governments and their people is also based on them diverse individuals within diverse countries can trade and contract safely be they male, female, disabled, able bodied, gay, straight, or fluid gender, Hindu, Christian, or Jew, Muslim, me or you.\nIf the EU were a “safe” place to be, the Uk should be able to re negotiate its contract with the consent of the EU itself; leave safe in the knowledge that the relationship it has with Europe would not be adversely affected by the Uk’s Brexit out of spite or stupidity. Can anyone really see that anything about the EU is in our sense , consensual, contractual and based on real choice.\nA Blue Revolution has a long way to go over many decades to create the global ideology based on Contract, Choice and Consent which will deliver trade, equality and opportunity, but the process has to start with the slow and well managed detaching of the UK from the EU and the development of Contract, Choice and Consent and the moral basis for all communities, countries and individuals.\nIt follows that if other nations want to renegotiate the contract with the EU they should be able to (that’s a Blue Revolution!) Should the rest of Europe want to default to a trading only status and open upto the rest of the world so as to continue to spread the word that internationalism and millenium proofing does not come from an EU or any other “State” bureaucracy, but comes from a trading world based not on corruption, coercion and compulsion but on Contract, Choice and Consent….Vive la real internationalist revolution. Isn’t that something the left used to say years ago before they became the state..\n23.02.16 ‘Socialisms’ dark secret. It has at its heart intolerance and discrimination. What chance has individulit got with Big socialism?\nNews from Oxford University that supposed bastion of tolerance and open debate which reveals how the freedoms we have taken for granted to speak easy and openly on any one of a range of topics is being undermined by “ideological academe”. The Ideology isn’t based on anything as wholesome as freedom and choice but on socialism influenced by a large dollop of Islamism and its fanatical hatred of the state of Israel.\nWe fear for our future here at a Blue Revolution; We fear for it because we have government on a scale too large to connect with real lives to balance out rights and responsibilities, we have a publicsectocracy fighting to preserve rank and privilege like our UK Junior Doctors, and EU technocrats and we have universities that have “safe spaces” where it is not possible to speak openly about certain subjects whilst at the same time fanatical views about the destruction of the state of Israel are promoted.\nOxford is where the sexual politics of the transgendered community mix with the politics of sexuality, socialism and Islamism. This happy coalition of the red and the green is both frightening and perverse united only in respect of the anti Jewish sentiments expressed by both groups. Once the useful idiots of gender politics and the socialists get the Islamists their much sought after platform and influence they will have served their purpose and there will be little mercy shown. The safe places will become sanctuaries where only “sharia” will be spoken in hushed reverential tones. Exclusion and discrimination will be introduced and in the dying days of socialism and free market economics (with all its senseless immorality) mankind will once again allow itself to slide too far backwards to protect the basic rights of all citizens e.g. Jewish, gay and transgendered people.\nWe have a chance to do something about this as we can read the past and plan the future and we must preserve freedom of expression by championing contract choice and consent for all in the face of Islamism’s gentle but unrelenting onslaught. Remember if you mix red and green you end up, up to your neck,…….. in the brown stuff.\n27.02.16 The Chinese and US want to keep us in Frau Merkel’s harem. They would wouldn’t they.\nIt is no surprise that the Premier league’s top two teams the US and China want to thwart the ambition of the number five team and its aspiration for greater global influence based on its’s historic trading networks and high levels of global integrity. This position held by few if any other countries is based on hundreds of years of trading along side countries on all continents, many have through Britain’s commercial imperialism, adopted the Capitalist model and have evolved into free market economies. As a result they slowly reflect in many instances the liberalising social trends that follow this economic evolution.\nGreat Britain has tempered the excesses of the free market with its post war socialism. Whilst it still has to deal with the distorting effects of untargeted welfare, the rise in the power of its public sector, and tackle the effects of secular westernism, a particular bugbear of we at Blue Revolution; Britain is leagues ahead of the US, China and the EU in terms of its economic and social evolution. As a result Britain can act as a guide, mentor, trading partner and friend to countries searching in earnest to develop proper market economies of their own. Many of these are of course part of her Commonwealth many more are the under developed food producers that world population growth can’t do without.\nBritains truly international role can only be re ignited with it abandoning the EU and its bureaucratic self promoting and reactionary elite, thereby re establishing for herself a place within the world economy in her own as opposed to the EU’s right.\nTempting as Frau Merkel’s harem might appear, there is no dignity in being pleasantly seduced whilst having ones grapes peeled by a eunuch. Most of us would prefer to go out there into the world and continue to follow Britain’s historical destiny for trade and social evolution. This process was unforgivably disrupted by two self defeating European wars for which the EU was seen as a twentieth century solution but which is now simply part of wider Europe’s twenty first century problem.\n03.03.16 Islam’s long overdue appraisal. And some stretch objectives.\nAh…..come in Mr Islam. My names Earth…Planet Earth. I’ve been asked to undertake an appraisal on your work with us over the last thousand years or so. I understand you might be a little apprehensive but please, please, be assured this whole appraisal process is intended to be of assistance to you and the work you will I hope continue to do here at Planet Earth. As I’m sure you know we will be looking back at your contribution to Planet Earth to help establish your performance expectations for the…….lets say next century or so.\nNow then a quick look at your performance over the appraisal period. I have been made aware that in the beginning you were hitting almost every target set for you…….not easy with so much challenge, but I am led to believe you brought a lot of stability to our business of creating new human life and using our Planet Earth resources to provide the value to support them socially and economically….And more interestingly you did this in many parts of my business world not blessed by an abundance of rainfall and fertility.\nI’m told that our Chairman said in the early days you spotted the need to impose a set of harsh social rules which put an end to life’s uncertainties, tribal squabbling, and war and therefore made the most of the agricultural opportunities on offer here on Planet Earth. The Chairman commented that his plan to open up the human mind to “consciousness”, quite some time before you joined the company, was something of a gamble, but in many parts of the planet in the past and now, it has delivered incredible results, many of them down to your early intervention. So well done for that.\nWhilst the total chaos quickly subsided after your early intervention and men began to amass value, the need to exact harsh punishments to ensure the continuity of the social order controlling that value has not really moved with the times has it? In fact the way that your strategy crystallised various repressive regimes and frankly nasty cultural practices should be an embarrassment to you…..but something tells me it’s not.\nI’m sorry Mr Islam but stoning and beheading was unnecessary three hundred years ago….but today it is quite frankly an outrage and a perverse part of any strategy for building a just and fair society. It will be an issue we will return to with your appraisal objectives.\nWhy do I want you to change it, you ask me why I want to change I? ….well for a start you strategic approach creates a perverse set of confusing and oppressive expectations on women, whilst removing the power balance the Chairman wanted you to aspire to for both sexes. It gives men an irresponsible sense of entitlement and authority over women. Men… your men I mean, seem locked into a sort of adolescence and your women are long suffering and invisible. The Chairman is clear this needs to change.\nYes I know that Mr Christian’s department is total anarchy…Yes I know its like Sodom and Gomorrah and I will certainly be taking that up with him and that rudderless and immoral department he heads or rather doesn’t, the one the Chairman and I call secular westernism….but this is your appraisal Mr Islam not his….\nMr Islam please put your sword away…..I won’t appreciate it if I have to ask you again. Are you clear on that Mr Islam, and please stop accusing me of victimising you. I know you are a good Muslim…..No please don’t take this appraisal as a personal criticism of you. No no I’m not victimising you, please calm down. Put your sword away please ….it is, if you would let me finish, an observation about your strategy. I’m suggesting you perhaps have not kept up with the modern demands of Planet Earth having failed to accept modern ways of creating and preserving social and economic value, and that is of concern. Lets have a two year breather and pick this up after a class of water and some down time.\nTwo years later the appraisal continues.\nRight now you have calmed down lets us look at some other areas, economics for example. here at Planet earth we provide our departmental heads with the flexibility to deploy the companies resources in ways which are beneficial to our peoples; the Chairman and I have been disappointed for millennia by the way that you departmental heads and those below you in middle management have shall we say appropriated or more accurately misappropriated the Planet Earth resources or held back the capacity of the wider human family to benefit from equality and fairness.\nI can cite some examples; oil for example. This valuable Planet Earth resource was available to all but seems to have been stolen by one of your middle management teams and has been used to simply support the kind of brutal management approach that I have referred to above and which is in modern terms outrageous. Public beheadings do not motivate staff Mr Islam, they strike fear into our business partners stifle the growth of the human family and destroy freedom, initiative and innovation all three fail. As I say we need to have innovation and your team do not do enough of it I’m afraid.\nWhat was that what about Islamic State. Mr Islam if there really is a place for you in this company I can’t see based on the performance of the lamentable output of your R and D team. The return to the tribal anarchy that we had hoped you would deal with eight hundred years ago has returned on your watch. Mr Islam R and D stands for Research and Development not Repression and Destruction. What you and your small team of R and D adolescents are doing is quite simply shameful to Planet Earth.\nI and the Chairman are rather surprised you and your wider management team are not doing enough to challenge members of this rogue department for which I am afraid we hold you wholly responsible. They fail to innovate and fail to do anything with the Planet Earth Resources they have stolen aside from destroy them and along with that starve Planet Earth People. We want to see progress Mr Islam; your record on providing stability isn’t at all bad your ability to do it without causing fear and hatred through brutality and repression is I’m sad to say lamentable. I hope you are not putting your hand back on your sword again……No …Good. Lets move on then.\nSo far we have undertaken a “Helicopter analysis” of the last few centuries and brought things up to the present day. Now we need to go forward with some stretch objectives.\nFirstly some positives: you have managed to retain the concept of the family as a basic social unit. This is commendable particularly given Mr Christians team’s obsession with destroying it. However we need to see change in the following areas\n- you need to stop promoting aggression and intolerance of others. The Chairman has been clear; he created religious diversity; you have no right to destroy it.\n- You need to reduce the number of cultural practices which undermine the status of women.\n- You need to find ways of ensuring your department produces real social and economic value through real social and economic activity; rather than simply pumping value out of the ground and wasting it.\n- Finally you need to work towards embedding Contract, Choice and Consent into your department. If you can do this you will be well on the way to achieving the previous three Objectives.\nThank you for your time and in put Mr Islam we can review these in 2150.\n07.03.16 The publicsectocracy is the beating heart at the centre of western democracy. In who’s name do they speak?\nThe rise of the Publicsectocracy and its self interested exploitation of ordinary people is an issue of huge relevance to every ordinary citizen in the west and is particularly relevant for those considering the future of the EU. Socialism as it manifests itself in western societies post war economics has moved beyond leavening the more severe effects of Capitalism (from pollution to starvation for example) and beyond engaging in wealth redistributive economics (Nationalisation, fiscal and welfare intervention). Like all economic paradigms from Tribalism to Capitalism the prevailing public sector model works in the interests of the new public sector elite.\nFor any Socialists out there this will seem odd. How can the senior public sector workers operate in their own interests. Surely they operate in the interests of the public. Isn’t that what Jeremy Corbyn is always on about; Boss bashing whilst lionising the public sector be they Doctors, Teachers, Nurses, left wing city and town hall bosses etc.\nBefore we go on, we want to make it clear that we absolutely support all public sector workers at every level and profession. This is not about hitting the public sector per se but about exploring how the public sector promotes the new elite paradigm which promotes its own interests. Just like the Capitalist who was unaware of his “exploitation” of workers so the new elite is unaware of its exploitation of consumers and taxpayers….but this doesn’t make them bad people. Capitalists were not on the whole “bad people” just people working in a system that worked to their advantage.\nIn the case of the west it is its the public sector ruling elite who benefit from the new “free market model” and this at the expense of workers, small businesses and taxpayers. So we at a Blue Revolution ask; in who’s interest do they serve, be they senior UK civil servants, EU technocrats, the US political elite, establishment politicians, lawyers, Judges, Public Broadcasters, or Doctors? Well their own interest of course!\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the capitalist system circa 1900 and before needed reform. From slum dwellings, to dirty water and air the working men and women who had created the economic value subsequently acquired by the capitalist ruling elite were oppressed; in classically Marxian terms “exploited”.\nThe post war reforms in Britain after world war one and two began the process introducing socialism and began to shift the centre of economic gravity from the “bosses” to the “workers”. The process of developing a welfare state plus nationalisation enlarged a group of state employed workers who had at all times prior to the turn of the 20th century, owed their living to the taxes paid by the wealthy, a wealthy who in turn had exploited the workers to acquire the wealth from which the taxes were paid.\nUnderpinning the employment of this group who at the top consisted of top civil servants and Judges right down to police constables or nurses was the idea that they operated within the paradigm of the ruling elite and were there to promote that paradigm. So for example law was about property, health was about getting the worker back to work, and the military was about pursuing global economic ambition.\nThis process was weakened after the second world war to the point where by the mid 1970’s the workers could bring companies and governments to their knees. The concept of the “elite” and with it their paradigm began to shift. Away from the “capitalists” the paradigm moved from the production of economic value by the application of “capitalist” concepts such as economic production based on value, price and profit, to the consumption of wealth via wages, debt and welfare. As the production of actual economic value declined (much of the value was by mid 2000’s produced in China) the west had to create a new “post industrial” paradigm. This was Christened the Clinton/Blair “third way”. Essentially the confidence to live and spend beyond our means.\nThis is essentially what we still have now, even after the banking crisis; a mature economic model based on consumption. the “elite” are those who can consume the most. Consumption of wealth has little to do with the production of value. No one is creating enough value to pay for our social structures of which the public sector is now the larges element.\nSo when we asked in who’s interests do the “publicsectocracy” operate, it is in their own interest. They are not acting on behalf of any other elite…there is no other elite. Bankers promote debt, people get into debt, governments borrow and spend money and the ordinary “workers” acquire a small part of the debt as wages as or welfare and then spend it on consumption.\nThe publicsectocracy get a good chunk of this debt paid to them in super salaries by governments who take the money from workers in taxes. However what do the ordinary people get for their taxation.\nLawyers limit justice by not reducing their fees, Doctors demand more money whilst we all get fat, Judges let terrorists “remain”, MP’s vote themselves pay rises, and the EU f****s up just about everything, and the whole merry-go-round of uber consumption does another debt funded rotation.\nNo one cares, no one is meeting the moral, economic or social needs of ordinary people, the moral nightmare of being “ordinary” goes on(Just watch “Grimsby”) as people borrow more just to keep up.\nHowever whilst this elite “moral paradigm” is undermining the moral landscape of the ordinary person, it is not guilty of promoting the needs of any other elite. s we have said above they are promoting the interests of themselves, the the new public sector elite…… devoid of any moral substance other than to consume, for them life remains grand and will continue to as long as the debt can be re scheduled.\n10.03.16 The EU makes money available to stimulate growth. How legitimate is his morally and are they just financing consumption?\nWe have previously referred to the toxicity of the publicsectocracy’s iron grip on the economy (although definition of the term Publicsectocracy is still evolving given this is a newly minted term).\nWe at a Blue Revolution argue that if you can’t see the corrosive effects of the QE, tax, borrow and spend approach to economics as practiced by the consumption hungry western economies, then you probably have far too much faith in the ability of governments and central banks to stimulate real growth via “production”.\nThe reality is that the new money borrowed and spent simply gets used to stimulate immediate consumption with no descernable long term benefit to the economy through increased domestic production. This applies even with “capital projects”. The model is flawed, it can’t really work and if it does “appear to work” it is really just smoke and mirrors.\nThe debt, to fund spending approach to “growth”, which fails and fails again, is promoted due to both the economic illiteracy of politicians, as well as the insatiable demand by “the public” to “consume” on a very personal level.\nPoliticians are happy to play thick…so they can go on stimulating consumption to make people happy and willing to vote for them. The public sector elite facilitate, collude, promote and fund this flawed economic model in the hope that at sometime in the future the model will really work; Guys it won’t. The alternative to this is hard and could go badly wrong for example allowing the rich to hoard wealth. These risks can be dealt with however by limiting the amount of wealth floating around looking for a rich persons bank account in which to settle. Remember not only is all property debt but their wealth (the wealthy that is like Trump) owe their wealth to your debt.\nIt is therefore not more consumption which western economies need ( most people are better understood as “consumers” rather than citizens these days and you can measure this by their girth). Economies need producers and in particular producers of food, energy and products with high value. Economies need food production and leading edge products …not easily done in a Europe full up with people and with insufficient land to feed its large and gorging population and with educational standards in freefall. Using free market economics to deliver food for the world via multi nation collaboration (as opposed to EU restrictions) is clearly and self evidently the key to success for all. There are other advantages too. A plurality in food production and multi national collaboration reduces the “risk” to food supply.\nGoing further still as economic determinists we argue economics and morality are linked. So many global economic problems could be overcome if the world was able to go further promoting productive land use with land currently controlled by the mad men of ISIS and their Boko Harem colleagues, as well as land under used due to restrictive trading practices. Economics could do a lot to neutralise the fanatics, if economics and actual production drove economic value and based on them social values of Contract, Choice and Consent. As we see too often dust bowl Islamism is stifling free economics and rendering too much of the African continent a war zone, therefore the problem is that free market Economics are being stifled by religious fanatics and this is prevented the evolution of modern social values.\nIn the west the problem is different but still linked to economics. In the west it is the perverse outcomes of free market economy that is driving anger and apathy; alienation in classical Marxian terms (i.e. divorce, loneliness, drug misuse and unemployment).\nIn the west it is not religious fanatics and their wars, but the moral framework that free market economics delivers, that adds to the west’s difficulties and drives government policy. In the west what happens is that debt and spending drive consumption and this is the economic “context” upon which western values and morality are based. This is the context that drives expectation, entitlement, hatred and greed in equal measure. It fuels the migrant crisis too.\nWhilst the economics of the 21st century West are clearly “shonky”, for us economic determinists at a Blue Revolution the real problem with “shonky” economics is that it eventually translates into ” shonky social values and poor public morality”. This works on the basis of an almost iron law of socio economics which we can illustrate with a simple history lesson spanning five or more thousand years.\nTribal societies are heavily coded and gender based. Values or social justice is differential and often delivered depending on age, gender and tribal position. In feudal systems the rank structure is reinforced by arrangements for power and succession. Whilst power is wielded by males, the females associated with those males have rank too. The day to day morality is determined by the ruling group and reinforces a moral code which maintains the status quo. Faith is used to reinforce the “natural order”. The rules are there to be followed and any deviation is met with a violent response (Britain c1400 to 1700, Saudi Arabia now).\nCapitalism changes the rules again. The application of uncompromising morality weakens progressively as capitalism matures and a shift occurs towards abstract concepts like Consent, Choice and Contract with rules backing up these arrangements. The rules of course support the ruling group by this time the owners of capital. Contract, Choice and Consent might have useful social application (marriage for example) but to get rich using them you need to acquire wealth and then the system allowed you to grow it by exploiting “contracted workers”.\nSocialism changes the rules again. the value created by capitalists is taken by the government (no choice or contract and consent here). The value is re distributed down society. In theory at least there is no injustice or problem with this as Capitalism needs some regulation. Even Adam Smith the father of economics recognised the need for regulation to prevent men of capital exploiting workers and consumers.\nHowever the story of the positive link between economics and morals goes off the rails at this point. The British socialist post war settlement was never “updated” so the redistribution of wealth eventually stopped being a net and became a trap. It created entitlement by welfare recipients and to manage the system, a burgeoning public sector offering higher wages than on offer in the private sector was created.\nState involvement also fossilised the hierarchical character of the public sector with its army of “leaders” and “Strategic managers” “Chief Executives” and “commissioners” all too aware that abandoning the model or even laving the EU might bring to an end the government gravy train.\nThis model of crystallised government involvement in the economy has coincided with another more damaging change and that is the growth of the “consumer economy”. As we said above people are consumers and with the decline of “capitalists” who create value based wealth coupled with governments under an obligation to provide public sector jobs and welfare to support consumption, we have created a toxic amoral mix of debt based money and an absence of any real meaning in life other than ” what and how much of it can I consume”.\nThis consumption based on debt model ends up being a competitive struggle to acquire as much debt based wealth as possible. The winners can consume as much as possible, and if they need to be consumed to get more wealth for example by making themselves available sexually, as long as it takes place based on Contract, Choice and Consent it should be Ok. A look at any high street at 3am on a Saturday or Sunday morning and one can explain the high rate of illegitimate birth. To be used morally, Contract, Choice and Consent needs a moral framework. The free market isn’t it and only Islam seem to want a fight. Islamism however doesn’t recognise Consent let alone contract or Choice.\nSo when you get economics based only on debt you get a culture based only on consumption. This turns people from factors of production to units of consumption. Once consumption becomes the only thing that matters, people will do almost anything to enhance their ability to consume, morals go out of the window unless the whole model can be re focussed around creating value not just consuming debt.\nIncidentally speaking of debt based income and where the free market lets it end up, the luvvies have been on the march recently; Jude Law and Emma Thompson giving us epsilon level consumers some moral advice about migration from the superior vsntge point of their alpha level consumption.\nWell here is a lesson in Blue Revolutionary economics; you Sir and Madam should in a just society receive only what the people who produce value can spare after they have supported their own and their communities basic needs. Your income should be residual spending by workers who commission your services for “entertainment”. However, consumerisms reliance on turning debt into wealth turns this natural order on its head. Thespians now acquire large amounts of income generated by debt and therefore your income is not residual value in which you would probably get a modest living but is debt via which you, like many others, gain quite a lot. That would make you a parasite in any other economic and moral regime. In this one you are a debt predator like footballers, Z listers and general slebs. Check your advantage…it may not last forever.\n15.03.16 Apart from avoiding the 7 deadly sins what else must one do to live a just life?\nLiving the life of a Blue Revolutionary is probably the only way that over the next 100 years we will avoid a number of repeating problems such as international conflict, human rights abuses, red and or Islamic revolutions and the resulting economic and social stagnation that will almost certainly result.\nBlue Revolution is also the way of life that if widely adopted by people of all faiths and none will stand between the twin challenges to future human evolution; total free market consumerization of everything or the alternative the growth of intolerance and blame leading to rules and restrictions. This is our Armageddon.\nIn the consumerization corner we have modern free market advocates including big companies and governments. Allied to them (a little like the people who support the “in campaign” for the EU) we have the people who see their own personal consumption, or the prospect of being consumed as a person (sexually or emotionally) for personal gain and who see this as morally acceptable. This results in Chaos. This is where social fabric gets undermined by widespread moral decay caused by too much “free market” and not enough social value. In this scenario governments get overwhelmed by the demands of their consumption hungry electorate. In Britain the “left wing” capture this point of view better than the right. The public sector becomes the publicsectocracy and tries to substitute morals with rules, the elderly are looked after by “carers” not family, pornography drives human sexuality, children combined with welfare are both causes and the result of the universal consumer ethos. Loneliness, depression and substance misuse both increase and drive more money into the hands of the publicsectocracy who create jobs and consumption but offer mere palliatives as a solution to this existential crisis.\nIdeologically within this developing context the EU over reaches itself and rather than individual countries failing (and getting the support from other more successful nations) the whole continent fails collectively resulting in total crisis.\nIn the Intolerance and blame corner we have a number of competing ideologies but the one that will emerge pre eminently will be Islam. In its Saudi form it will survive and possibly evolve into an appealing if rigid form of faith based totalitarianism (like it is now) but the context will be to allow survival of humankind within its context of social and economic breakdown. The Saudi’s and Islamists in general see the future as their empire and correctly identify the secular west as orchestrating its own demise by its failure to submit to the will of God.\nThe next most likely challenger to the rise of a coherent Sharia based Islamism is socialism. This however is a socialism of low tolerance and “collective” submission to the will of “the people” or rather the government as the people. This socialism will be a little like the Islamism we have described and like emerging Islamism we see the emerging themes of this form of socialism; “no platforming”, attacking historical facts with warped modern sensitivities, undermining the wealth creators and creating a “loyal” client state of submissive Public sector workers and welfare recipients. Plus of course the bullying of women in politics and education.\nSo we have our Armageddon, a clash of free market economics turning everyone into consumers or the consumed, supported by debt, and the alternative; a morally uptight and repressive ideology of Islamism or a weird form of socialism which will be devoid of the liberating concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent. This clash could be called a clash of civilisations but of course neither has much to offer modern “civilisation”. To avoid the clash and the triumph of one of these two regrettable scenarios, we need to become Blue Revolutionaries; people who limit their own consumption and reproduction and are happy to deliver high levels of social and economic value with empathy resilience and enthusiasm. Not too many of us around regrettably.\n18.03.16 Every week a further undermining of progressive values by Islamists and their left wing fools and fellow travellers.\nWhen we were children many of us would have enjoyed the dot to dot picture. An opportunity to learn simple numeracy as well as have fun trying to identify the emerging picture. It has become a common phrase in the English idiom that to understand something we “join up the dots” or if we are confused or can’t work something out we are accused of not having ” joined up the dots properly”.\nThis latter phrase sums up the situation with the so called “liberal” left who’s muddled commitment to “liberal” values sometimes extends as far as supporting ideas and policies which reflect a narrow minded view of society and in particular primitive ideas about gender inequality.\nWe have written about this before. On that occasion some Labour MP’s had gone to some gender segregated event and were happy to be well…. segregated. We made the point that a progressive perspective would surely be to see good relations between people as about more than whether one has a uterus and another testicles. Once again another British place of “learning” has allowed a segregated event, this time the LSE and the female Student Union representative felt “safe” behind the curtain with the women.\nWhen will the left wing in the Uk learn that by caving in to these regressive and discriminatory ideas they are simply encouraging the marginalising of women from politics, academe and the work place. The slow insidious promotion of these “values” will imperceptibly shape perspectives on women, on Jews and on many, many others. By encouraging the notion that such ideas are acceptable these ill informed left wingers are making the concept of “traditional cultural practices” (sometimes this involves chopping bits off people, mainly boys but particularly harmful for girls) tolerable. Eventually many male students will be emboldened by a notion of their “natural” superiority, supported by their prominence as the “culturally superior” gender.\nLet us not overlook the fact that to Islamists women don’t have to attend the mosque because a woman gets her moral instruction from her husband. The upshot of these views as we see in the North Eastern towns in the UK are that women will be insulted, humiliated and silenced out of public view and public life.\nThe “liberal” left’s lack of a narrative to deal with this, for them confusing situation, is rather simplistically because of the insidious way the arguments in support of regressive practices are presented as emanating from a “victimised” Islamic culture. Oh and a little more controversially, many of the people promoting these silly ideas are brown in colour. Not fat white, easy to hate men, but brown men who dress “culturally” and don’t like fat white men either.\nThe problem for the Labour party, the LSE Student Union, and every other left wing useful idiot, is that many of these men don’t like Contract, Choice and Consent, freedom and democracy…..particularly when it is women who feel empowered by them. It is really time the British left got the cultural dot to dot book out and started to join up the dots properly this time!!\nRemember next time you are invited to an “Islamic” do, just ask if is segregated and if it is, politely decline with the words….men (women) have nothing to fear from me this is the 21st century after all.\n28.03.16 Brexiteers should have vision and hope but fear is ‘winning’ the debate.\nThe problem with Britain’s EU debate is that it is becoming like most political debates emotional in character. It seems to us anoraks at a Blue Revolution that people’s capacity to think has been dulled yet people’s ability to “feel” or “empathise” has become over developed. This explains a number of oddities like the so called “intellectual left” overlooking regressive Islamic values and showing solidarity with people who look “repressed” or “under represented”…..sometimes groups should be “under represented” because they talk s**t. Lesson for the left here.\nAnyway back to the main point. As we have lost our capacity to think we have lost our ability to have a personal vision. So we wait around for leaders to have vision for us into which we can then tap assuming the vision feels right for us. We don’t thin about which political party will create the basis for us to achieve our personal vision. This explains the support for Danald Trump in the US and Jez Corbyn in the UK. In both cases there is little intellectual merit in their positions but they hit the visual cortext of the intellectually impaired and offer a feel good vision. The problem is both visions are intellectually incoherent. Exploring this is for another day.\nIn respect of the UK’s EU debate the same problem applies; the whole debate gets swept up into emotion. We have spoken about the EU before and identified ourselves as “Brexiteers” on the basis that big bureaucracy is bad not just for Britain’s economy but for the continent of Europe too. However we want to explore this “Brexiteer” position from a few we hope thoughtful angles which avoid end of the earth scenarios. So far the UK Governments position has the emotional heft but is fear based and neither visionary or realistic. The Big Bureaucracy case is a bit bogus. Britain being part of something with real clout.\nThe story of why the dinosaurs died out is relevant to this aspect of the EU debate. From childhood we remember that with a brain the size of a walnut and the body the size of a bus there was a lot of body to manage with very little brain. When a catastrophe took place the dinosaurs waddled a few steps into crisis and finally extinction. The EU is like the dinosaur; it is big and cumbersome with little brain to co ordinate a survival strategy for its huge body so it waddles into crisis by trying to preserve it’s huge cumbersome body. Smaller mammals survived, they had less body to support, and were nimble and quick to exit a crisis environment. Imagine if Schengen was no longer about free movement of people but the free movement of workers; the various more nimble components of Europe (Nation States) would have adapted independently to nip off the migrant crisis.\nThis immigration crisis is a wholly created EU crisis (ignoring Blair and Bush’s Iraq war) and there is too little “brain” to deal with it. The EU therefore reverts to various types of emotional response to the crisis, from the usual faux sympathy with migrants, to denial about the all too predictable cultural problems that arise when you combine people from a liberal culture with males from a gender obsessed culture based on power and male authority. Duh…..didn’t see those problems coming. Better just deny it’s a problem.\nThe other bit of emotional claptrap is Europe is safe within the EU. The migrant crisis which is as much cultural as economic is highly unlikely to prevent the growth of hostilities on the continent. People don’t like being patronised by a technocratic elite as they see their children’s progressive values undermined by culture’s that want to restrict opportunities for women and offer only hatred for gays, Jews, Christians etc.\nWe see the west has big cultural problems mainly socially engineered by well intended but self defeating welfare policy, but the response to these problems is not Islamic unless you have reached some kind of “critical density” and it is the only show in town. It will not be many decades before the Caliphate of Belgium will be a threat to the progressive values of Europe and the EU will not be a solution…..its cumbersome bureaucracy will be a big part of the problem.\nThe idea that drove the EU was post war stability…..the second world war…..not the wars in Syria, Iraq, Libya and so on and so forth. These wars……unconventional, immoral and frankly disgusting are likely to create an existential context for Europe within which our lumbering EU will have no capacity to offer solutions or to even in the long term survive. However it will have lumbered around long enough to undermine the survival instincts of the nations of which it is comprised and undermined their populations hard won progressive values.\nFinally the other forlorn claim is economic attrition if the UK exits the EU. This is really the most specious claim of all. Britain was a great manufacturing and trading nation, now we run an economy based on house building, debt and consumer spending. We have become over confident as a nation about spending beyond our means. A rather tragic position shared by the EU. If we want a culture based on values which are driven by an economy based on the progressive concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent (as opposed to corruption, collusion and compulsion) then getting out of the EU will be a liberating experience and will allow the UK to re build its real economic manufacturing base (steel anyone), correct its reliance on welfare and debt, and to trade as friends within Europe and the rest of the world rather than as a member of an exclusive but ultimately unsustainable clique.\nThere will be no crisis if the UK leaves the EU just a gentle glide back to social and economic sanity will follow. No need to get scared.\n04.04.16 All property is debt. Consumerism, the lack of an industrial policy in UK and the 1980’s economic ‘revolution’ explained.\nGosh how can so many disparate things can be linked? The fact that the word has finally woken up to the Generals and Field Marshalls of the publicsectocacy and their ploy of turning other peoples personal and government debt into their own personal wealth is great news. It has been going on unrecognised for years. At least now it is “pubic knowledge”.\nPublic service, followed by a feeling of having done some good, is no longer enough in a world where money is easy to create and for those in the know it is easy to get more of it to enhance ones value or status as a “consumer”. The most immoral part of this amoral system is that these tax evading people were denying their free, humane liberal societies the tax income necessary to remain humane free and liberal. It is almost treason in a world where we are only ever a step away from Corruption, Coercion and Compulsion.\nThe people who get the wealth are no longer the people who create the value (like it was in old fashioned “Capitalism”). Today all property is debt. The people who create the personal debt are also forced to service government debt through taxes (lets call them poor people). Therefore they get spun twice. Getting into debt themselves to buy their way into “consumption” and paying tax to service the debts incurred by the government.\nTo maintain levels of consumption (and therefore the support the economy) governments pay for the public sector on behalf of the tax paying public whether it is via health, defence, welfare, law etc. In the US the accent is on Defence in the UK it is on health. Each has its fair share of public sector “fat cats” generally doing a well paid job very badly.\nThe public sector is in our view generally no longer adding “social value” but its role is to keep the “economy” ticking over. Its costs are too high and the balance sheet therefore tips towards it being an ineffective way of dealing with the social challenges that confront the west be those challenges moral breakdown, obesity, stupidity, economic failure or what ever.\nThe Public sector and its leaders; the publicsectocracy, be they Civil Servants, Publicly funded Senior Administrators or politicians do however fulfil an important role; they consume a lot. In the west, consuming stuff is the smoke and mirrors of the modern economy. George Osborne can really play the Wizard of Oz, pulling leavers and pressing buttons to turn personal debt (including personal debt on new housing built on green field sites) into Government tax income and then into public spending and then consumption, with some kind of multiplier determined, on the basis of ” economic confidence”. How long this charade can go on? We estimate no too much longer but probably beyond the next British General Election and post a Clinton/Trump Presidency. And then what?\nThe other effect of this reliance on consumption is that people stop being citizens with responsibilities and obligations (e.g. as parents or productive workers); they become “consumers” and therefore take little interest in how something evolves (even their own children) as their only interest is how stuff is consumed.\nIf consumption is the purpose of the economy as it appears to us to be today, a government needs to do only two things; ensure there is enough money in circulation to enable consumption to take place (Gov’t wages, tax credits, welfare) and ensure that what is consumed is produced cheaply. This is done by exporting the value creating part of the manufacturing process to places like Vietnam, Korea and China.\nAs a substitute for real value, post industrial economies rely on the concept of “value added” to generate economic value……but this is a poor substitute for actually making a product combining land, labour and capital plus “risk” and then competitively selling it to people who have real value of their own with which to trade…..oh but that sounds too much like a proper economic model, and not enough like the “Alice in Wonder-la-la-land” that passes for a western economy today.\nBasically “Value Added” involves importing a product maybe “designed in the UK or US” and selling it. There is some “value”……but not a lot. However someone might get rich doing enough of it and then off shoring their tax arrangements as well.\nSo when did all this Alice in la la land economics actually start. In our opinion it started under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan. The concept of supply side economics plus the rather more laissez faire economic model which was the hall mark of those who saw controlling the money supply and trading freely as essential to good economic stewardship, came along just as the Chinese were by the contrivance of a “Communist ” government providing the largest proletarian army to western manufacturers in the history of economics.\nThe result was that western bankers came into their own selling cheap money to people who could not afford to borrow it, but in doing so enabling confidence based consumption to become the new “economic base”, whilst the productive part of economies shrank and public sectors and welfare expanded to maintain levels of consumption. Moral changes followed too with divorce and welfare babies becoming products of the consumer economy.\nIn the consumption obsessed British economy there is a British Tory government that can’t articulate what the problem is, for example with British Steel, or what the solution for the steel industry might be. Unfortunately since the 1980’s we have had governments who have no concept of how making stuff needs a strategy (free of the EU of course) and can also recognise that making stuff really isn’t just about jobs that can be replaced with a job at a supermarket. Making stuff, or growing stuff or pumping or cutting it out of the ground is about the health, intelligence and resilience and future of the whole nation. The real Thatcher legacy (and it is no fault of hers) is that in the west today, being “self made” does not have to involve stuff being made here or taxes paid here, but thanks to debt it can and is consumed here.\nThere is only so long that any country can continue to rely on, what we call, the worlds debt reliant economic “froth”.\n05.04.16 Contract, choice and consent the essentials for freedom and democracy Vs corruption (control), coercion and compulsion. Over coming the latter with the former is the wests big challenge.\nWe are going to do a full piece on “family life” and consider in particular the recent revelations about the attitudes of UK Muslims as published in a recent “Sunday Times” survey which confirms pretty much all we have been saying for 12 months or more. However by way of assistance to the “elite” who have slow marched us all into this situation with pop up Caliphates and Sharia within various communities we offer the first of a few suggestions by way of solutions. One of our contributors has attended a workshop on “communities” hosted by the Department of Communities and Local Government, however most of the suggestions made were it seems ignored; such is the power of the lower ranks of the Publicsectocracy!\nWhen communities with different cultural influences speak about feeling British they are not necessarily thinking about HM the Queen, David Cameron and his “British Values”; they are probably not thinking about warm beer and widows cycling to a church in every village, they might not be thinking about the NHS. Evidence suggests that they are probably grateful that they can be “culturally different” and be safe, but they would easily make things collectively unsafe for others without knowing they were doing it, simply by being dogmatic about certain “sensitive” issues that offend them. This is the challenge for the concerned liberal; how do we preserve freedom for all in a culture of converging intolerances .\nLike the British left wing who confusingly support Islamists (Islamist are not necessarily terrorists or criminals), the reasons that those with a different cultural influence support British values are potentially muddled and ill understood by them. Support for these “British”values is based on a general feeling that on a personal level seems “right” as opposed to wrong. This is even though an objective analysis would indicate it is naïve, ill informed and dangerous to “support” British values in a intolerant or self interestedly way.\nThe “British” identity in many who are culturally influenced out side Europe is less significant than many well intentioned liberals would like to imagine. Like “Human Rights” “British values” are narrowly defined and are used to promote behaviours that are at heart intolerant and hostile to others whilst at the same time self serving and self promoting. As we are only just beginning to realise with Islam.\nSo how to we address this issue of “British values” (still undefined) being used to promote intolerant values? Well for a start we can define not just “British” values but values that should win the support of all who wish to preserve freedom based on democracy and he rule of law. Because we have no basis for defining “values” we tend to end up talking about concepts such as “fairness”, “equality” “fair play” “freedom”. All these are laudable terms but mean nothing in reality and can be easily dismissed as waffle by those who wish to dismiss them when say describing inequality for example in the case of women. Equality is easy to dismiss, shorn of the concept of equal before god in Christianity there is no real equality here on earth. So if women and men are not equal so what. The same goes for “fair play”…. it is a nonsense term.\nWhat is needed therefore are terms which avoid defining status or position or which try to create the illusion of fairness. This isn’t going to happen on earth anytime soon. However we need terms which define relationships between people affording respect and authority in equal measure. How these concepts deliver a distribution of the worlds resources is for politicians but people need to safe with easily understood concepts. Therefore we at a Blue Revolution have come up with Consent, Choice and Contract as the values that need to be promoted if the westen worlds legacy is to be preserved. These terms which are unashamedly Capitalist in character underpin the progressive values that people in the west recognise and which have resulted in the freedom and democracy taken for granted today. However as we retreat from Contract, Choice and Consent as they are seen as not delivering “fairness” the world becomes more familiar with Corruption, Compulsion, and Coercion. These terms are seen from the Corruption in FIFA to the Coercion of women in British universities being segregated at Muslim Student events, to the lack of consent around forced marriage and modern day slavery.\nIf the west wants to create some clear blue water between progressive and regressive values western societies needs to recognise that before the west created the value that enabled democracy and freedom to be afforded for all, it created the environment where feudal corruption was driven out by Contract, Choice and Consent. The issue about how the value created by capitalism is or rather was allocated is for politicians and socialism has had a role here. But in these austere times the baby of the three C’s seems likely to be thrown out with the baby of “it’s so unfair or we are offended.\nSo in answer to the question above for a Blue Revolution this is the critical challenge for the free world. However people of all faiths might be persuaded that Contract, Choice and Consent are concepts worth endorsing if Corruption, Coercion and Compulsion are the alternatives.\n12.04.16 The decline in the quality of western life and the Islamist challenge to that decline. How should the western world and western worker respond.\nWe have commented previously that Islamism (perhaps in common with many fundamentalist faiths) is obsessed with gender difference, male authority and submission to the will of God. This is a series of preoccupations which have shaped the way the west and the Islamic world interact and explains some of the problems such as Cologne and regrettably some of the more extreme horrors of Islamism such as terrorist attacks.\nThe secular western world (secular westernism) is of course quick to point out that the west cannot be blamed for the Islamic worlds hatred of “our way of life”. However is this really a fully defensible position? Whilst nothing can ever justify the criminality of terrorism the hatred of the western world is a little more explicable. The west has committed a number of crimes against evolution which to anyone with a ridged and simplistic faith based mentality looks like incompetence of a glaringly self destructive stripe. The lack of structure within the family, the lack of public morality (immodesty and too little self restraint), the lack of submission to goals other than personal ones, and finally the reliance on debt and its transformation into wealth for the elite of the publicsectocracy (the taxpayer funded elites like politicians and technocrats) and big business.\nThe roots of anti-Semitism lie in the perception that turning debt into wealth is a singularly Jewish conspiracy. It is not; it is just how the system works for the rich and the powerful within the public and other elite sectors of the world.\nThis incompetent but “gamed”system which benefits the few at the expense of the many, fortifies the Islamists view that the west is a decadent “spent force” with no grass roots appeal. The up swell of general anger and dissatisfaction amongst the wests welfare recipients and poorly educated, many from homes blighted by secular westernism (divorce, drug abuse, poverty, debt and so on and so forth) adds additional credence to the Islamists view. Islamists see that in time these western economic “strugglers” will provide an army of the disaffected, manufactured by a bankrupt system, and for whom no government debt funded intervention is likely to solve their problem. Only a return to “faith” and in particular “Sharia” will solve their existential crisis.\nThe reason for the western worlds failure to deal with the problem of decline is that welfare funded by government debt doesn’t solve problems it creates them. people see their lives lacking the meaning and purpose that comes from creating real social and economic value; under secular westernism people simply exist to consume. The consumer is the means of achieving a governments economic “growth” but it is growth based on rendering human experience pointless, a little like that of being a pet..\nThis pointlessness funded by debt however makes governments happy and some of the elite very rich. Faith (morality) has, as we have said before, tended to reinforce the means of economic production and reinforce the social norms that underpin that production. In a world of little purpose and a swamp of debt-based consumption, morality still follows the economy and we see the results all around us. Loneliness, divorce, mental illness, illegitimacy, promiscuity, pornography we could go on. This is the secular western context that Islamism sees as so ripe for destruction. The problem for the west is that unless we change our new reality (by blue revolutionary means) the Islamists are on the money; secular westernism cannot survive and it is open season on what if anything will replace it. Oh but the EU is not the solution!!\nTo nudge the west away from its sub conscious but self-destructive urge we need to re engage western people in the business of creating social and economic value; Brexit for the UK, getting people back into value producing social and economic activity and breaking the cycle of your debt becoming someone else’s wealth. With this all based on contract, choice and consent supporting freedom and democracy there will be no fertile context within which Islamisn, Fascism, or any other ism can find a welcome.\n20.04.16 Wizard Osborn’s US Munchkins and the yellow brick road of debt based growth in the EU.\nIt is nice to know that when one wants to get some credible advice the British electorate can rely on the Munchkins of the US treasury. Men who have pumped liquidity into the worlds financial system to stave off its collapse, a collapse caused by the unsustainable growth of private liquidity brought about by the sale by banks of personal debt to people who could not afford to re pay it.\nThis handful of “experts” who like Osborne have identified “growth” as the sacred cow of modern economics have failed to appreciate how “growth” without value is toxic, poisoning the body of the economy; distorting wage and labour markets and inflating stock and property prices and shifting debt obligations to governments and therefore the poorer taxpayers. Growth has to be real and not simply an engineered illusion that leaves most people worse off whilst the publicsectocracy and big business get richer at everyone else’s expense. One of our graduate economists calls this process of debt turned into to public sector or business wealth; “debtamorphosis”. We like it but don’t know if it is original.\nThe idea that bringing this fanciful “growth” illusion to an end could possibly damage the British economy is utter rubbish. The EU like the US is dog knotted to this idea that growth at any cost is justified; even if irresponsible borrowing is the stimulus for this growth. We need value based growth by trading where the value is i.e. outside the EU.\nThe uncertainty that frightens Osborne and his Munchkins and the loss of growth that may result from Brexit is, in outcome terms at least, nothing compared to the predictable long term consequence of the UK’s obligations to the EU forcing it to borrow and spend to maintain consumption and the illusion of growth. Immigration is one mechanism via which government borrowing gets translated into spending or “investment” and thereby stimulates “growth”.\nOsborne is honest that by staying in the EU by 2030 there will be another three million more migrants in the UK. The real economy will not be able to address the needs of these people unless governments spend and borrow to cope. Like people who sell farm land for housing for personal profit, by borrowing to spend to cope with migration the government puts their own short term need for re election and to suck up to rich EU friends, before the needs of the debt burdened British people who pick up the tab for the borrowing.\na Blue Revolution recognises that Munchkins with daft ideas can contribute little to sorting out the UK’s, the EU’s of event US’s financial problems and the social problems that arise therefrom. So please spare us anymore Munchkin speak whether it is from Ford Motors, Treasury Munchkins or even Obama himself. As the Bible says “don’t take the splinter out of my eye until you have taken the plank out of your own”.\n21.04.16 Saving the waring barbarian world from itslf. Peace through trade and contract, choice and consent and not welfare and bureaucracy.\nThis was blank\n22.04.16 Obama and the EU. He mentions the war but gives away the fact he doesn’t ‘get’ it. Or maybe he does!\nJust a brief comment from us as there won’t be much that has not already been said about President Obama’s visit, but always wishing to make the oblique or obscure observation a Blue Revolution can’t be silent on the fact that President Obama (who we respect for not being a war mongering psychopath) has simply missed the point on the EU….or so it appears.\nBy mentioning the war he gives away his reference point as “the past”. He might just as well have said the special relationship and his right to speak on all matters UK goes back to the spanking the UK received at the hands of the US in the 18th century. The post Second World War era was about building bureaucracies out of necessity to create resilience and foster peace. However the aim of the bureaucrat or publicsectorcrat as we now call them, has stopped being that laudable aim (because we have gone beyond the need for it within the west) , and it has become to preserve the bureaucracy at all costs. This is a useless arrangement for the challenges of C21st and C22nd century.\nThe world needs to stop wasting value on pointless organisations that are not based on informed Contracted arrangements, widespread Choice and Consent from the citizens e.g. the EU (but not like the much more ethical Commonwealth, UN, WTO and NATO). Indeed Obamas comments about the US treatment of the UK if it leaves the EU, is not informed by fair play but compulsion and coercion. Really fair? Really modern and progressive?\nPresident Obama uses the words of confrontation and disrespect to Britain and its independently and truly internationalist people to try and achieve an outcome he and his financial and political elite wish to see imposed on us, irrespective of what British people feel is good for Britain.\nPerhaps President Obama’s and his replacement’s real challenge is that as we have said before the US is too big, too diverse and broke and perhaps there are worrying stirrings of a sort of revolution in the US, a bit of geo political disaggregation within the States you might say, power to the state or groups of states and away from the fed. Whether it happens or not is not our issue but no one should try and silence or game the discussion over here.\n25.04.16 With horror from both the ‘in crowd’ and the Brexiteers we mke our final comment on the referendum.\nWe believe that Britain needs to create relationships with countries that trade globally in” value” and have “values” underpinning their society that promote the social stability necessary to ensure the “state” doesn’t bureaucratize too far and therefore undermine the efforts of the economy to create real value .\nCountries with growing economies aWe feel we have said a lot about the referendum and have nailed our colours to the mast as full on “Brexiteers”. s well as the stagnant can benefit from trading with Britain as Britain can benefit from them, food security for us, ethical services for them. All of this would be premised on a trading relationship based on Contract, Choice and Consent; This is the DNA of all “free societies”.\nWe think that the EU is a bureaucracy that was set up to achieve peace amongs previously warring nation states within Europe. However since the 1970’s the whole concept of the “nation state” has been undermined by mass movements of people. Many of these people who share a wide range of views are not necessarily progressing the interests of women and others such as minorities.\nThe EU promotes the idea of mass immigration because in the absence of actual economic value being created via production of food, mining of resources and manufactured goods the next best way of providing what looks like value but is really little more than wealth is to create a debt culture. The debt culture supports welfare and on a national level allows poor EU countries to buy German cars until they are broken economies. Student debt and creates millionaires who using the process of “debtamorphosis” translate other peoples debt into their personal wealth. The beneficiaries are the publicsector tax paid fat cats, as well as the business people, footballers and actors who seem to be able to acquire wealth well beyond their actual worth. This debt based economic model enshrined within the EU and the UK needs to shift gear.\nThe debt dependent model will eventually collapse under the weight of its contradictions; most notably the fact it costs too much to run a malfunctioning multi ethnic society with an economy that produces too little real social and economic value.\nIt is true that migrants boost the economy but in our view the mechanism is complex and probably based on a mix of earnings, debt, welfare and rent plus house prices going up in the buy to let sector. Migrants also keep the unemployed on welfare. Taken together this probably “grows” the economy but it is not growth that means a lot in real economic terms. For politicians debt has the feel good effect of delaying the problem of economic weakness for another day or another election whilst being largely the public and the taxpayers problem.\nThe debt culture as we see with mass retail keeps pointless jobs open to….. far to many pointless workers. To change the model overnight would be cataclysmic but leaving it as it is, in world of stagnating trade between big continental players locking others out would be the western worlds longest suicide note, akin to drinking ones self to death.\nSo before we move finally on to other topics, leaving the EU is the right thing to do…it puts a nimble Britain in charge of its own destiny. It allows Britain to use its international contacts to spread the values of Contract, Choice and Consent supporting freedom and democracy to places in the world who need to trade and to come on board with this culture that promotes the values that will secure the future of humankind.\nA Bureaucracy might feel like it is a protective blanket but in the world of the 21st century it simply gets in the way of progress, fairness, transparency, and trade.\nNow lets talk about other things.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_a-lesson-in-marxism-for-labour/content_358.html": "A lesson in marxism for Labour\nWhy does the Labour party consider Jeremy Corbyn to be a Marxist whilst at the same time viewing Labour left wing manifesto as progressive? Marx was writing in the 19th century and his ideas were mauled by among others Lenin and Stalin before being discredited and flung into the dustbin of history. Had Marx undertaken a review of the Corbyn/Milne agenda he would have called it “vulgar socialism”, redistributive, based on the idea that society comprises those with money (from whom you extract it) and those in need to whom you give it. Marx didn’t say much about what came after this socialist phase, but he did not see it as the final showpiece for his Communist Manifesto. He saw Communism as the “negation of the negation”, something negating socialism, socialism which has itself negated capitalism. So from our perspective, we believe we have had since the end of World War II a credible form of socialism which has progressed fairness and opened up opportunities to working people, now, however, socialism is turning on the people, with taxation, debt and strained public services. Some public sector workers are treated worse than a 19th-century mill worker whoever is in power. All this is going on whilst the socio-industrial model so beloved of the left pays a fortune to the socio-industrial systems least productive tier the chief executives and senior managers.\nSocialism whether the modern socio-industrial hybrid we see in the NHS and public sector today or the actual industrial model so beloved of Corbyn is actually counter-revolutionary as well as being counter productive.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_a-fresh-look-at-meritocracy-maybe-we-have-all-got-it-wrong/content_207.html": "A fresh look at meritocracy. Maybe we have all got it wrong.\nThe Marxian notion that economic resources should be allocated “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” (1) has always caused confusion. Such a method of allocating resources is not typically associated with merit because of the prevailing twentieth-century view that Marxism is state social engineering, so merit cannot play a part.\nHistorically society has created meritocracies on the back of economic systems which exploit the labour-power of others, legitimising it with religious, legal and political structures which collectively define the parameters of consciousness.\nToday we are governed by politicians who have run out of ways to improve society without the use of debt to maintain the political status quo and to prop up levels of consumption to maintain GDP. This badly distorts what we have come to accept as meritocracy however worthily it is viewed, our consciousness was and still is defined in terms of exploitation.\nHaving debt as a substitute for economic value with its burden falling to workers of future generations, whilst maintaining outmoded politics and supporting a global financial elite, suggests that we need to look at how we can create a more just system which better reflects a modern conception of merit.\nAllocating resources based on ability and needs without state engineering requires us to look anew at the concept of merit and meritocracy. In doing so we must place it in a free market twenty-first-century economic context with opportunity and choice as central aims. “From each” “to each” within Marx’s definition suggests opportunity and choice is integral to the economic and political ‘settlement’. Rather than state engineering based on mere conscience that the system is ‘unjust’, modern collective consciousness may act as a worthy substitute for state interference.\nIn the twenty-first century “From each according to his ability to each according to his needs”, must be expressed both economically and politically but reflect Marx’s vision of society with a modern collective consciousness that rejects the exploitation of others at every political and social level. Merit is not about status and wealth, both of which remain the benchmarks for measuring the success of a meritocratic system.\nMarx’s vision of workers controlling capitalist production has little modern relevance. However, the principles that underpin capitalism and are enshrined within Marx’s analysis of capitalism can be used to formulate a new concept of merit that promotes opportunities for ordinary people within a free market society.\nCapitalism was, in its earliest iterations, meritocratic but economically unfair relying on the appropriation of workers labour-power to create capital. It reflected principles of contract, choice and consent as the basis for delivering economic and political freedom, only open to the elite.\nSocialism extended the principles of contract, choice and consent to all adults. We have become accustomed to the freedom this offers us. The state has probably moved as far as it can go in extending these principles socially and economically allowing same-sex couples to contract in marriage for example.\nHowever, locked into their own eighteenth-century political bunker, parliament is unwilling to extend real political choice and consent to working people. “Meritocracy” remains defined by eighteenth-century ideals. Our political system is sadly a mausoleum to eighteenth-century capitalisms economic unfairness and therefore it is unable to address the economic inequality and unfairness it seeks to change. Its definition of meritocracy remains wealth and status based and is therefore inherently unfair and unequal.\nMeritocracy must not be one based on an economic model that enshrines merit in terms of wealth-based status. We must define merit in terms of how well people deliver positive economic, social and political outcomes for themselves and others within a free market, based on contract, choice and consent. This must be done legitimately with mass support and without burdening the people of the nation with unrealistic financial expectations based on the economic principles and ‘successes’ of the past.\nThe meritocracy of the future should allow the ordinary person to achieve economic and political parity with those people who enjoy power and status today. Of course, given the role of debt, it does not mean ordinary people going up some national debt-based wealth or status ladder. It means those currently on the top of the existing ladder coming down. The economic framework, the free market, is already in place, what it lacks is a legitimate political expression. Meritocracy must now be about politically empowering ordinary people.\nReform of the political system must reflect the new economic reality of the free market. The power to reduce the cost and burden of the state on the ordinary worker and thus promote enterprise will never come from a state which refuses to move beyond a political environment set up in the eighteenth century to represent the interests of extinct economic and political elites. In much the same way as the left has lost its industrial working class the right has lost its British economic elite.\nAchieving change must involve empowering elected representatives at every administrative level from parish council up. Making them functioning members of the legislature. Politics will become significantly more meritocratic and less party dominated. It will be possible for specialists, as councillors, to address parliament on areas of expertise i.e. farming or teaching.\nIt will mean that the costs of the state will be exposed to the scrutiny of ordinary workers and are more likely to come down than go up. Routes into politics will deliver more access to ordinary people thus empowering them. This will be meritocratic in two ways. It allows successful politicians a career ladder that requires paid employment in lower tiers. By reducing the cost of the state, taxes will be lower stimulating the economy. It will reduce feelings of “them and us” creating perceptions that fair resources are distributed based on abilities and needs. Politics needs to align with the meritocracy of the free market our twenty-first economic reality.\n- Karl Marx Critique of the Gotha Programme. Progress Publishing. eighth edition 1988 p18",

So we won’t do that. We explain our policies.\nThe vision of Blue Revolution is to extend democracy and make Britain safe in perpetuity. We need it as violence both domestic and street violence is going up and the binary political system can’t deliver an answer. The nature of politics, therefore, has to change and we need to extend the legislature down to almost parish level using elected representatives and technology in a wholly 21st century way. Our aim, therefore, is to deliver enhanced democracy into a parliament that has been designed (in the 18th century) to meet the needs of elites past and present. This is why Corbyn can argue that the ‘system’ works against the people, but he hasn’t done his analysis and therefore doesn’t know why. We do know why and will make every elected representative in the country a contributor to the legislature and to the national debate. Had this happened in the recent past we would not have got ourselves up to our neck in the EU, We would not have had the industrial unemployed silting up the departments of the state with crime and unemployment. We would have adjusted public spending to accommodate the effects of globalisation, rather than throwing these workers into the hands of global markets which promptly found no use for them and put them on the scrap heap, there maintained on a diet of welfare and health care.\nSo what of our pledges at this election in Boston and Skegness. Well out of the EU but with closer trade links with the real countries of Europe. This is fairly obvious but in reality may be difficult to deliver. However, it is the trade that has healed rifts within the continent of Europe, not the EU which is now threatening to destabilise the continent due to tensions around migration, youth unemployment, bailouts, the Euro and demands for an ever closer political union and economic convergence. A vision of a contented continent trading freely is a vision every country will identify with.\nMore workplace democracy for public sector and publicly funded workers. It is clear when you speak to public sector workers who operate in some of the most hostile environments that they feel bullied by a system that demands performance to a measured set of targets. We would recommend that targets are scrapped and the hierarchy in public services flattened. Rank structures that owe more to the 19th-century industry rather than the 21st century public services must go and staff at the actual delivery end of public services should design implementation models for the services they are the experts in and deliver to the people.\nCut State Bureaucracy but not the public services we the people pay for and need! Above the delivery end of services, there are ranks of highly paid people who don’t deliver services but manage the processes and targets set by the government. Essentially they add no actual value but they cost money to employ. We would simplify the structures within public services whether it is street lights or adult social care and cut at the top, not the bottom. Modern technology will be used to make this happen.\nDeliver education suited to all abilities and scrap SATS and Student Debt. SATS are a cruel measure of schools and a child’s aptitude. Simple school-based tests which are based on Maths and Spelling should be used to inform children and parents about a child’s attainment level with advice on how to improve. The whole “it’s the schools’ fault” ideology which has undermined education and morale must go. We support selection but selection can be accommodated within schools by having certain students learning via IT at virtual grammars within their own school. Students’ in debt is an outrage, it deters progression up career ladders for the working class indebted student, as debt repayment kicks in. It thus reinforces the disadvantage it is supposed to prevent. The use of technology should allow students more flexibility with living costs and with cutbacks in the number of universities the debt should in our view be put back on the state’s books. This might be utopian but the option needs to be considered.\nStop people getting rich at the ordinary taxpayer’s expense. The upper echelons of the state machine and local government offer some horrendous examples of people getting hundreds of thousands of pounds in salary. Sunderland’s Chief Executive earns about £600,000 pounds in addition to a pension no doubt and the left wing councils are unsurprisingly the most generous. This outage will have to stop. No one paid directly or indirectly by the taxpayer should have a pensionable salary above £150,000 and no one should earn more than this at the public’s expense, indeed most should earn well below this.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-09-09-15-to-24-11-15/content_114.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 09.09.15 to 24.11.15\n09.09.15 segregation and faith- demanded by some but is it still necessary\nThere has recently been the debate about women only carriages on trains, seemingly supported by a Labour leadership contender. This along with the demand for gender segregation in universities who have accepted some Islamic guest speakers, as well as the use of the veil and other kinds culturally specific practices and behaviours, seems to have caused confusion to commentators and some politicians alike. There seems to be among some well- intended and liberal minded people the view that acceptance of these requirements confers important inclusive status on them.\nPerversely there has also been a growing intolerance by some females who identify themselves as liberal feminists but who rail against men who have the audacity to speak to them in public. Whether these men are “chatting them up” or are simply trying to make polite conversation in that strained British way, is perhaps irrelevant; the point is why react so aggressively to what is on the face of it harmless attempt at human interaction. Perhaps segregation provides the answer.\nThe main issue in these scenarios is that it is gender based and thus open to a whole world of confusion and misunderstanding; particularly in respect of what is suggested and intended. This happens in the absence of a coherent position about why such segregation is demanded. Should that position statement offer support for segregation though? Should it be general segregation, segregation in lecture halls, segregation on trains and the veil as a means of emphasising segregation. Are these the right and proper responses to the issues thrown up practically and culturally by men and women sharing the same space in lecture halls, trains and the world in general. We at Blue Revolution think not and wonder why there is little compelling analysis of why not. The well-intentioned liberal sleepwalking towards a world of sexual discrimination on the back of demands for cultural inclusion. You couldn’t make it up.\nCulturally mankind has been through phases where such segregating behaviour was not only logical it was necessary to preserve the social and economic context that provided the value and wealth necessary to sustain the community, be that a family, tribe or nation. Men and women had separate spheres of influence and therefore separation seemed logical and created stability where otherwise instability may have cast a shadow over survival. Like much that is outdated but “cultural” such practices become totemic of particular cultures or as with the veil, fetishized politically as a means of emphasising one’s faith based moral superiority. This is done not always with a calm and deep conviction that adherence to such beliefs about modesty is about personal identity, but as a loud expression of cultural and group difference. Culture can get caught in a time warp and distorts faith so it provides a reactionary solution to very modern problems if indeed some of these things are problems. Things like being chatted up on a train; solution; women only carriages, sexual delinquency in the community; public separation of the sexes, abuse of women by men; the veil. Really?\nOf course rather than accept these ideas at face value it makes sense to explore them sensibly and to arrive at a coherent perspective; the danger of not doing so is that the rights argument kicks in and the whole issue is drowned out as it is in France by the application of competing rights to do and not do. A kind of fetishism develops on both sides of the argument. The real question is this; just how necessary is segregation, in a world that needs to progress cooperation between the sexes so that mankind’s creative social and economic power can be maximised and perhaps the production of people curtailed.\nDo we really need to adopt practices which were more in keeping for an age of uncertainty, contingency, war, disease and famine?\nNow apart from confusion about how to solve the wests gender related social problems, what often leads to the demand for gender separation amongst the liberal minded is that the advocates are largely from a range of nationalities who feel their largely Islamic faith is persecuted by the west, thus oddly legitimising any anti-western cultural position on anything. So, some on the left give advocates of separation a sympathetic hearing. Some thinkers and even feminists appear sold on the idea that the capitalist world commodifies or objectifies people on gender lines too, therefore a solution is to segregate the sexes for non- capitalist reasons and thus neutralise the power of that capitalist objectification. This for us at Blue Revolution is like accepting the removal of a leg to cure the pain of an ingrowing toenail. We have explored objectification ourselves in previous posts. It is one of our deadly sins, the solution is nor separation though.\nOf course, the west has issues, big ones too. The freedoms allowed in the individuals having rights to Consent, Contract and Choose means that we can promote lifestyles which of excessive and bad for us and for our communities. We at Blue Revolution call this negative side to western culture “Secular Westernism”. However, the solution cannot be separation or segregation. We need to address the West’s problems be they problem of debt based over consumption, illegitimacy, divorce, depression, drug or alcohol misuse; but we can’t do this at the expense of our freedoms and our ability to mix and mingle together as genders because this is how we deliver social and economic value.\nIf you look at the joyous outcomes of the West’s freedom; the technology, engineering, space exploration, medicine, arts and sports one would not want to turn the clock back to any kind of separation or segregation based on a social and economic model that is now largely defunct apart from in ISIS territory. The blue revolution is not about taking away choice, contract and consent or removing anything that is positive about the way the west has evolved; it is about analysing and understanding why things are as they are including oddities like the demand for segregation.\nHowever, we counter these demands with a positive celebration what the West could achieve if individuals controlled their personal behaviour and adopted a more coherent view of life based on the freedoms they enjoy, but with the practice of personal self-restraint. This Blue Revolution is in the minds of individuals and unlike past “Red” revolutions not in the head of the group, be that group a segregated one or not as the case may be.\n14.09.15 What should a Corby win mean for those of faith?\nThis may be a bit polemical but it is clear for the Labour Party that a coalition of the socially vulnerable, the ill-informed and the downright stupid have elected leaders of such breath-taking economic illiteracy that it is to be hoped that they never have control of the leavers of government. People of faith or no faith, people who value their freedom to live a moral life or faith based life, feel safe to hold their own opinions and express their genuine fears about the state of the world however they see it, should worry a little more now. There will be unwanted interference from a party, even in opposition, who have declared a will to tax high and disincentivise work, effort and profit and who will, more importantly, try and define and control the social and economic paradigm in a way never seen before; simply to maintain fear and build support. This will mean the views of the Labour movement or the spokes people at its head, determine what is politically acceptable or unacceptable, who is in and who is out; what is socially acceptable and what is not, all driven by naïve collectivist thinking influenced by goodness knows who.\nThere is no “capitalism” that needs bringing to heel; we are not living in the 1900’s. The changes that have been positive at least in part since the last world war, have delivered a socialism (Initially the catastrophic government ownership of business and industry then re distributing wealth and protecting the vulnerable). However, the socialist dream in Britain and the American dream in the USA have delivered from “Capitalism” a free market system that has many faults and flaws. It has given rise to the commodification of people, given rise to illegitimacy and substance abuse plus needless consumption and waste of the planet’s resources. As we at Blue Revolution are always trying to point out the solution to this “Secular Westernism” is not collectivism on an economic level or socialism or sharia law on a social level but for people to embrace freedom and responsibly; not a Corbyn Red Revolution but a Blue Revolution with no head just millions of freethinking intelligent moral minds.\n17.09.15 Modern Deadly Sin Number 6- Selfishness\nSelfishness is a socially corrosive behaviour and to many people it is not something they readily associate with themselves. However, selfishness must extend beyond the personal into the social sphere for it to be a deadly sin. It is not simply about putting yourself first by taking the last piece of cake, although clearly this is selfish too in certain circumstances; it is about living your life based on fulfilling your personal needs and desires without any consideration being given to others. Working in the public sector; retiring to Spain and returning when infirm to be cared for by the NHS is clearly an act of selfishness. Ignoring the needs of adult children in a world where challenges for them are great and their chances are limited by straightened economic circumstances is selfish if what wealth you have goes on holidays or cars; divorcing the partner with whom you have children of whom you has tired or no longer find attractive, is selfish.\nThere are many similar examples. Selfishness is linked to other modern sins such as Objectification (number 2) and Want Based Consumption (number 5). At its worst one must objectify others to overcome one’s own scruples about being selfish and more often than not selfishness is about having money for one’s own excessive personal over consumption.\nThe social and economic consequences of this sin is that we withdraw emotionally from wider society or indeed from our families. We cease to be socially active and therefore our positive beliefs and values become obscured by our preoccupation with applying these values to ourselves i.e. generosity, kindness etc. In practical terms this means have fewer volunteers to staff everything from Charity Shops to soup kitchens to community litter picks. We have fewer people to support and work with the vulnerable, we have more single parents for whom partnering to raise children is not a selfish enough lifestyle choice. We have children who are simply not wanted but were brought into the world because of the access they gave to resources, often taxpayers resources, to pay for tattoo’s, alcohol and drugs flats cars and houses. We have the elderly being looked after by the state.\nSelfishness which was once frowned upon by those of faith (and for some if recognised, still is) is like our previous modern deadly sins, a component of what we call Secular Westernism, It is something all good people of all faiths and none need to distance themselves from; so the right social values start to filter back into those parts of society which need them and people come to accept that whatever one has or does not have, we should never turn our backs on our widest responsibilities to others.\nTo make a positive change part of our Blue Revolution, it cannot be directed for us by the state but must come because we realise that our selfishness is bad for us but more importantly it is bad for our community, our society and gives a very poor impression of our Western culture.\n20.09.15 Men and women; has our creative tension gone toxic.\nThe more we at Blue Revolution kick the topic of “men and women” around; particularly when we stray from a purely European or US centric model of gender relations, the more some of the fundamental issues we have covered over the last six months or so can at a very basic level, be put at the door of poor inter sex relationships.\nThe Muslim faith is want to refer to “the role of women in Islam”; a very important role but one largely dependent on women accepting two principles: one being a woman’s role is essentially social in character rather than economic and the second being that a woman acts in line with the requirements of her faith as determined by her husband or father who in turn takes his advice from the local religious leader who is an expert in the Qur’an and hadith. Now there is little scope within Islam to be of a “reformed” persuasion. Hence, we think we get the confusion over Islam and extremism. From a secular western vantage point much of Islam seems extreme; and indeed, it perhaps is.\nIt seems that for many within the faith that the “reformed” can be construed as un-Islamic. Therefore, relations between the sexes are quite prescribed; but living amongst people of the Islamic faith in the UK one is struck by the overall sense of peace that applies to the Islamic community in general. When it works it works well, but perhaps not to every secular western taste or social appetite.\nWomen with hair covered marshal their usually largish brood with love and devotion whilst father is at the Islamic club, work or mosque. There is overall an acceptance that this a prescribed way of life and therefore dissatisfaction is both pointless and unacceptable. We suspect this is a fact lost by the left wing who whilst promoting the destruction of the family through a change in values engineered by tax and benefit arrangements, also buy in to the wider collectivist moral values of the Islamic faith.\nWhen one looks at the lives of women culturally through the ages one sees by modern standards some very barbaric treatment; some of which has become fetishized around faith or culture such as veiling, shrouding, stoning of “Harlots” and adulteresses, the dowry, arranged marriage, foot binding, neck coils, and FGM. This treatment of women which we at Blue Revolution have described as a form of “proto fascism” has evolved over many thousands of years and apart from the fact cultures differ, the intent seems to be the same; to control women, constrain them in a “patriarchal” hegemony t0 protect male wealth and or status. No wonder once women lose their cultural link to this type of hegemony in whatever form it takes and for them it ceases to have legitimacy, some can get politically angry whilst others seem to want a kind of revenge for patriarchy’s past ills of which the hapless males in their lives are often on the receiving end. Paradoxically some women seem to turn to Leninist socialism; the bedfellow of all moral collectivist ideologies. The majority however it seems to us at Blue Revolution simply revert to a kind of primitive reproductive behaviour which is neither moral, sustainable or fair; particularly on their children.\nIf anyone is reading this; you may be getting a little angry; we are not however advocating any return to patriarchy. Alternatively you may start recognising that there is something rather odd about a hegemonic patriarchal almost universally derided culture which was at its creation designed to preserve the species through male power and supply both the maximum amounts of social and economic value and whilst legitimately being thrown away has no obvious replacement. Now in the west patriarchy has been abandoned its loss throws up anomalies like industrial scale child illegitimacy, lone parents; the oddity of people step parenting other people’s children whilst someone step parents theirs, lonely grandparents locked out of families with the loss of social values lost to a generation and mentally ill fathers with little contact with their kids and the need to unlearn “love”, kids in cars being driven for “access” and so on and so forth.\nThe question therefore arises thus; is there something innately human and dare we say legitimate about this derided way of ordering society. After all it goes back to the days when humanity was wealth creating as it is now. Or is there something wrong with how we as a secular western society have managed the sexual revolution in the absence of any faith-based belief in the ways we did things in the past. Whatever your views, (and there will be many, most, we suspect conflicted at a social, political and psychological and personal level) it is in our opinion a good question. We will consider it and return to the topic later.\n29.09.15 The world drifting Left? -What does this mean.\nThe Pope is going left when it comes to an array of issues including global warming, world economics and migration; the Labour Party is giving up the “middle ground” and going left wing. They are taking with them an array of morally well-intentioned, but we think muddled individuals who amongst other things attack “gentrification” by “direct action” and claim to represent the “working classes”. From the perspective of Blue Revolution, the self-confessed left wing whether people of faith or not, are something of an oddity. Faith has always acted to influence personal behaviour and the outcome has generally been positive and generated social and economic value. Notwithstanding unacceptable by-products of discrimination against women and gays being in modern terms unacceptable but culturally specific, the benefits to the majority were all to obvious.\nThe differences between faiths have been essentially cultural but the unifying characteristic was the requirement to observe certain ways of conducting one’s self; one’s behaviour was required to conform to social rules to maximise societies survival. The rise of Secular Westernism has seen the west strip away any broad observance of moral as opposed to strictly legal behaviour. Britain’s New Labour specialised in the kind of “moral minimalism”.\nThe consequence has been the rise of issues which require state intervention to correct; the correction usually comes via welfare subsidies and the moral decline that is caused as a result, simply adds to the overall problem generation on generation. The solution adopted by right of centre governments is to restrict the availability of Government generosity; the so called “austerity agenda”. The problem is that unless there is a moral revival those who feel the loss under austerity and are “entitled” to support, become angry when the support is restricted, reduced or removed. This is in simple terms the cause of the rise of the left wing.\nThe problem however is that the modern left wing sees more Government as the solution. More Government means more government workers, more tax, more welfare and ultimately less opportunity, freedom and choice. If the Government was so good at planning and getting it right, we would stop the disaster of modern dating and relationships and ask the Government to find us our friends and mating partners. But we don’t and that tells us all we need to know.\nThe left really is old hat. The idea of the government stepping in may have been necessary in 1900 but today…it’s a quaint throwback to an era that we are never going to return to. There are problems with “the free market” but the solution is not “Leninist socialism”. We at Blue Revolution agree regulation is necessary to ensure the producer/providers relationship doesn’t overwhelm consumers. But, the main power for change is the mass choice of morally informed people who reject the lifestyle of Secular Westernism by their positive economic and social choices. At the same time, they should also reject any laughable idea that bureaucratic state socialism has anything positive to offer either. Go figure!\n01.10.15 Love me do…….But in the bar the piano man’s found another nail for my heart\nOne of our occasional contributors was listening to a radio show in Stoke on Trent in the UK and heard an interview with the 1970’s and 1980’s pop group Squeeze. The interviewer was apparently very excited about interviewing them asking questions about influences such as location in south London etc. What struck our contributor however was that the lyrics of the songs written by Squeeze in the 70’s and 80’s resonate with images of a life of disastrous relationships, unplanned babies, failed marriages and general emotional sorrow. Men (and women) of a certain age let us say 50 to 60 were weaned on the Beatles “Love me do” but too many have, in the last 30 years, had nails riven through their hearts. These songs perhaps speak to that generation. As he says what kind of society can be cold hearted enough to think that the emotional warmth of the loving union of two people can be thrown away on an almost industrial scale and somehow that society survive more than a couple of generations. We agree; and we believe it is another symptom of Secular Westernism and unless we all address it as individuals by being more coherently caring with each other we will all be “up the junction”. ”Now, is that love” we ask?\n02.10.15 Migration-can faith offer some hope?\nMigration is different and somehow the same as it has been for centuries. People moved away from the straight jacket of Catholicism as it was becoming a stifling brake on the aspirations of the motivated and proto entrepreneurial. In the past as we have said before the Catholic faith had a legitimate role for the poor as well as for the rich and a whole culture was based on faith and feast days, Matins, Vespers, Compline and the Latin mass. But this didn’t make a good basis for progressive social and economic development. The people who escaped from Britain and its Anglo Catholicism went to America and founded states and great cities. Their faith evolved but there was a faith that endured. Their faith required hard-work and self-reliance. Not the dogmatic certainty of rich men in castles and poor men at gates.\nToday we have again faith-based migration caused by what is seen as a predominantly political crisis engulfed in a war. This crisis as with earlier ones promises to engulf economies, societies and enduring certainties; yet for some reason it seems not to be called a faith-based migration. But the more we look at it here at Blue Revolution the more it is clear that this is exactly what it is. People are fleeing warring tribes in Iraq, ISIS in Syria, they are leaving repressive regimes but in all these scenarios they are leaving a religious faith that is unyielding to the demands of modern economic progress. Thus, we have western attired youths and young people who are escaping the confines of Islam…not abandoning their faith but finding a place where their Islamic faith is more compatible with their own desires and aspirations. They are for this reason clearly more “economic” migrant than refugee….although there are many of them too.\nSo, looking at this as a crisis within a faith specifically Islam a number of suggestions can be offered; Places we call “dust bowl” Islamic countries need to see these migrations as evidence that there countries need to move from the 16th century to perhaps the 19th. Establish principles such as Contract, Choice and Consent as the basis of a slow move towards democracy.\nCountries that are currently repressive 19th and early 20th Century in the way they maintain order i.e. through bureaucracy, repression and lack of accountability, need to move forward to the 21st century, promoting human rights and freedoms irrespective of gender, sexuality etc. Saudi Arabia falls into the first category, Assad’s Syria the second. Much of Africa is in the former category. The western world’s fetishizing of “Democracy” needs to be tempered by the realism that until people can freely support themselves within their societies and to create economic value through contract, choice and consent; democracy will simply be a pipe dream. We think Putin gets this point better than western leaders.\nIs there a word of caution in all of this; well of course there is. Firstly, the countries from whom the migrants flee are the cause of their problems; not the countries to which they wish to migrate. Migration can be temporary as technology and transport remove the enforced permanent geographical and cultural separation migrants endured in the past; think air and sea travel, Skype and the internet; forces for good as well as mischief. But there is a lesson in all this for the west too. As we at Blue Revolution are always saying Secular Westernism is a cultural aberration caused by a lack of personal moral behaviour within a liberal economic framework and thus not fully worthy of the title civilised. For those people of faith who come to the west we must accept that many of them will find our culture deeply troubling. Rather than assuming they are wrong why don’t we accept they have a point and adopt the principles of the Blue Revolution to ensure we can accommodate people of all faiths and none.\n07.10.15 Dust bowl economics in Britain- some mistake surely\nThe conference season has come to an end, thankfully! What are our observations? Well Tim Farron gave the most passionate speech about migration, wonderfully delivered but unfortunately it lacked the smack of realism; a kind of German welcome without the jobs or the infrastructure. Labour were back on the old socialist treadmill; sucking up value created by working people and spending it on government projects to help, well the government; government employees, and perhaps the army of people who have been undermined by years of moral minimalism at the hands of New Labour. These sad and vulnerable people now lack not only skills, but the values that make work the first thought in the morning rather than the thought dismissed as the duvet goes back over the head at eleven PM. We understand what causes this problem it’s the secular nature of modern western culture; secular westernism as we call it.\nAs for the Conservative party; we would prefer to refer critically to what we view as a policy designed to appeal to the imagined “middle ground” but which has as much moral substance as borrowing from the future to pay for the excess of the present; we refer of course to the myth of home ownership and the destruction of lands productive food value.\nNow let us define our terms; we at Blue Revolution are only concerned with value; social and economic. Value is inherent in land, as it is in people’s productive capacity both for economic production and the production of social value in the form of cohesive behaviour that promotes the survival of the group be it family, tribe, country, kingdom or empire.\nTaking a piece of unproductive land and building housing on it allows that land to realise some social value as well as create some wealth. As unproductive land it has the actual food producing value of a piece of rock. However, take some fertile farmland that gives up it produce in the form of food value and you turn a repeating cycle of value into merely wealth. That wealth might increase, but the food value inherent in the land is gone. Even open unfarmed land has some social value as recreation. So, if you promote house building on farmland, are you really creating anything of real economic value or is it simply a case of creating wealth, which simply feeds the monster of secular westernism? Paying as it does for consumption and with that all that the secular market offers but which has no discernible social or economic value.\nThis is the “dust bowl” economics in the west. Whilst the moral outcomes are not inhumane, the process is like that of the oil rich states; you take value out of the ground and use it to prop up an increasingly unsustainable economic model. As you do this people become more dependent on the valueless wealth and entitled to receive it and the whole socio/economic model becomes utterly incoherent, unable to pay its way in the long term. Incidentally we also feel that the Conservatives “own rather than rent” policy drives the same kind of incoherence; trapping people into wealth generating “homes” which simply feed the desire to consume unsustainably. We agree that all forms of home ownership and good quality tenancies are legitimate; but the government has no place interfering in the market at all. Germany does a lot better than us because there the economy produces value rather than using home ownership to generate wealth.\nOh, and all the above explains why socialism is the ideology of the past and has no place in anyone’s future. Socialists only speak of wealth; they have regrettably lost all notion of value. But expanding on that, is a post in its own right.\n13.10.15 Labour and Conservatives; what if anything do, they have in common?\nMost notably they both define their economics in terms of the nation’s wealth, its creation and distribution as opposed to the nations value its creation and distribution. Wealth has become a shorthand for value but is it?\nThey have differences of perspective of course but they are economically less striking than they at first appear. Since Adam Smith first penned his “Wealth of Nations” the term wealth creation has become the shorthand for what economies should do; they create wealth don’t they? Politics of course is about how governments manage the nation’s wealth and how and to whom they distribute it.\nThose who read the Blue Revolution posts will possibly be aware we very rarely refer to wealth, preferring the term value. Value has two essential types; social and economic. Social value is about the capacity of a society to behave in a stable way within the economic context which defines how economic value is created. The creation of economic value is determined by the way society mixes the resources (land, labour, money and skill) necessary to feed and support its people. Both types of value are connected but to really appreciate the raw necessity of this link we need to look at tribal society.\nTribes are simple societies, but they have faith in and are compliant with their tribal system which defines everything from the age at which one comes of age and what one is expected to do at that age, to how food is acquired and consumed. Value therefore is about how we maintain ourselves within a stable community based (hopefully) on a shared belief system. Beliefs which are necessary to maximise social and economic value.\nWealth on the other hand is not what a tribal society had to worry about managing, they don’t generate wealth.\nSimple wealth arises when one is able to generate more value than is required by society and then having created it, store it and accumulate it…..storing it became easier with the discovery of precious stones, gold and silver. As we said above to get to even simple wealth creation you must generate more economic value than you need. Once this has happened the next stage of development is politics because wealth can be controlled and does not have to be distributed. Unlike the cave man dragging the valuable carcass of an antelope into the tribal compound to be consumed by all before it rotted; wealth could be stored, managed, and therefore controlled. The person who controlled wealth had power, power to hang on to it all or give a portion of the stored value on those who served them. Their wealth conferred for loyalty would be used to buy food shelter etc.\nNow this simple wealth has a strong link with value; because simple wealth is an accumulation of actual economic value. Our early political evolution was essentially a process by which we argued about to whom simple wealth was distributed; feudal overlord or merchant trader. later, Marxism was about the distribution of wealth and the need to change the whole social and economic system to achieve a fair distribution to those “workers” who create the wealth, rather than the “capitalists” who it was claimed exploited the “workers”.\nThe above is a whirlwind trip through the history of faith, society and economics all three sort of linked in a somewhat wobbly but coherent progression. So far so good but what has it to do with modern politicians. By the time Karl Marx was writing the obvious abuses of wealth accumulation were hard to avoid. Poor people were working to create wealth for the rich and suffering extreme poverty as their reward. Not even tribal society with its gender defined roles and tribal mutilations was responsible for such extreme differences in what people had within the same community. Hence Marxism’s claim that capital is misappropriated by capitalists under a cloak of contract and consent.\nAnyway; how can we pull this together and answer the question above? Well once we were able to escape the tyranny of wealth based directly on actual use value and we developed ways of creating wealth based on smaller and smaller amounts of real value and politically wealth distribution and consumption became a social pre occupation, we were able to use some of this largely valueless wealth to “speculate” on the future. Borrow and pay back tomorrow, buy now and sell at a higher price later. Then even more recently take something of no actual value (stocks and Shares?) and sell them for money borrowed from banks by the person who buys them or in the case of ‘shorting’ borrow the shares themselves. Once we have got to this point wealth bears no discernible link to value and is indeed a froth on the surface of a very impoverished economy paying for a slowly diminishing society. We call this secular westernism, others casino economics\nIt remains the objective of modern secular western politicians to oversee societies which create and distribute “wealth”. Both Conservatives and Labour old and new are interested in wealth and its redistribution; But what relationship does this wealth have to social and economic value. We at Blue Revolution suggest very little. Broadly but not exclusively government has taken on a role generating wealth via Quantitative Easing and spending to create a budget deficit if. The banking system, house building, increasing house and stock values creating wealth too. Both are in very simple terms ways of manufacturing wealth rather than creating value. Of course, this is a very simple model; it ignores things like low interest rates as a positive way of driving progress, stock issues as a way of facilitating investment and the need for a complex society to have underpinning it a complex and accessible economy. It also ignores the role of the rest of the world producing the value we no longer can, perhaps because we simply have too many unproductive people here in the west a consequence of capitalism’s failure and evolution into a free market.\nWe at Blue Revolution believe that what western society needs is to get closer to creating proper value; even if we are poorer in terms of our apparent wealth for doing it. We believe we will be happier as a result. This is the basis of our Blue Revolution; moral renewal and value creation by proper un-gendered social and economic endeavour. We will explore this later and explore what we can all do to become a Blue Revolutionary.\n17.10.15 What might happen if women lose their biologically and sociologically defined role as child bearers and mothers?\nAll faiths and even many of no faith; governments and other groups continue to promote a biological and sociological role for women; encouraged with varying degrees of emphasis or compulsion by the welfare based incentives offered in the west to the threat of punishment up to and including execution for those who fail to deliver on this “expectation” elsewhere. We have described the historical treatment of women by early culture as “proto fascism” and when the reality of past women’s lives are examined that term seems to acquire serious relevance today; particularly in places like the definitive dust bowl economy that got lucky; modern Saudi Arabia with its ancient gender and faith obsessions parading as civilised behaviour in the twenty first century. No chance of women in Saudi being given choices to re-evaluate what is a biological accident but which determining a thoroughly ghastly sociological reality. Anyway, we have Blue Revolution observe more interesting places that Saudi Arabia and Japan is one such place.\nOn the face of it Japan probably doesn’t strike one as being of much of interest to the secular western populations in Europe and the US; less of an economic power house more of a post-industrial society settling down to the reality of declining influence and exposure to the exhausting effects of global competition. A bit like us in the west. However according to what we have been told there is a sociological phenomenon taking place in Japan which is quite fascinating and probably needs some Blue Revolution evaluation; men in Japan in the critical 20 to 40 year old demographic are losing their interest in sex; at least sex with other people.\nWe would vouch that when you empower women and they are able to assume an economic role as opposed to following the pre-determined path towards motherhood; the effects on men is to turn sex into simply another narcotic experience; and for the Japanese and I would suggest the more protestant inclined amongst the Christian community plus others, this “narcotic effect” of sexual behaviour in not worth the complex sociological and psychological consequences on men of getting tangled up in unnecessarily complex relationships. The relationship with a woman who is economically independent would become like that of any good friend. Is this a good thing or a bad thing we ask?\nWell anything which gets away from the biological predetermination based on sex and gives people real as opposed to an imagined “choice” about their lives, has to be good; so long as they work to create the social and economic value necessary to support them and their community. It also has the effect of reducing carbon emissions and is kinder to the planet. With fewer people the planet might stand a chance of recovering from the combined effects of carbon dioxide, monoxide, methane, sewage and plastic bags. The oddest phenomenon for us is the sight of the right on earth parent with seven children who wants to save the planet. No chance.\nSo, to conclude our latest rant; what is our conclusion. Well bring it on. Reduce the incentives for women to have babies; there are enough people in the world having children in cultures where sex is for reproduction rather than for the narcotic effects, we in the west “enjoy” and obsess about. There will be fewer by products often paid for by an unwilling taxpayer to parents who would have been better off drinking a strong coffee or doing some aerobic exercise or simply “sorting themselves out”. The longer we continue to define a woman’s role in religious terms and engineer a welfare system to support it within a culture that sees reproductive sex with someone else as a recreational entitlement, the bigger our problems will be in the longer term, economically, sociologically and environmentally.\n26.10.15 Feminism and the obsession with the biological role of women- Why not join the patriarchy\nFeminists including the sainted Germaine Greer obsess about “women’s experience” as though it unalterably different from men’s experience. In some specific situations it is, but really, we are talking about some specific instances. Ms Greer who we at Blue Revolution understand is something of an apologist for the cultural barbarity of FGM, overlooks the fact this is a practice that is intended to lock women from traditional societies into a subservient social and biological role, in contrast to the more “important” male role of ‘economic’ provider. If it happens here in the west it is because we have helped establish the absurd idea that all cultures are equal without the qualification as to how we might measure equality. This is Ms Greer’s problem. Cultures are only equal in the sense they provide the framework for the creation of social and economic value. In simple societies and ones that separate sex for cultural reasons this is gender based. How cultures justify this is either coherent to the means their society has of creating social and economic value i.e. it makes sense socially and economically; for example men and women’s segregation in 7th century Arabia; or it is totally at odds with how value, social and economic is created and preserved today.\nIf any modern society or feminist commentator, observes the pre-eminent role of women as “biological and social” and in the case of government this perspective gets props up with the support of a welfare system that reinforces women’s biological rather than economic role, they are over playing the significance of the role women have been fighting to escape from for centuries.\nIn the west biological and economic roles are hard to combine effectively; hence past discrimination. By supporting the biological and social role of women, sympathisers such as Ms Greer are setting a trap for western women that many cultures of the world would like western women to fall into (Saudi Arabia anyone?). They are, without even being aware of it, aligning women with the patriarchs of male hegemony; seeing women in purely biological and social roles; from which here in the west, it is all too easy to fall. Our broken families attest to the challenge of combining so many roles.\nMs Greer’s views on transgendered people is illustrative of the point. Gender is irrelevant unless you see people as social and economic gender specific terms. If you see people as a mix of social and economic and that the mix is determined by them and by no one else, the women’s experience for those who opt for an economic role becomes no different from that of men and people who are transgendered. You work, you contribute to society (be a good citizen) you die. It really is time we started to ignore the ideological academics who capture a view that bears little relevance to reality and in its pretence is a dangerous distraction from the aim of creating first gender and then genuine faith and cultural equality. This gender equality of course must be distinguished from the transactivism agenda. Even if equal they are still biologically women as distinct from biologically male.\n28.10.15 America-a country in need of help?\nJohn Kerry believes that the world is an angry place; people are angry he has said; the flood of people from Syria and Libya and other places in Africa reflects a flee not just to wealthier economies but from the anger of War and hard-line Islam. In America gun crime and the all too predictable schoolboy shootouts continue as evidence of individual bursts of insane anger by a collection of sad and lonely misfits.\nIn the UK the anger feels less pronounced but bubbles up with either nationalism or socialism amongst the more political, its effects mitigated elsewhere by a welfare system which promotes for too many citizens “self-actualisation” through survival by fornication and the consumption of welfare income. This promotes a pointless hamster wheel lifestyle for too many Britons that achieves little but is unlikely to generate too much in the way of revolution, as it dampens rage, but also delivers little or no social or economic value.\nCompared to the US the UK has also managed to avoid some of the pitfalls that have both positively and negatively shaped America, its economy and faith. America has a frontier mentality, something which is sublimated in the form of the “American Dream”.\nWhereas the class system in a country like the UK has placed a psychological limit on what citizens believed they were entitled to achieve, in America there is no such constraint and failure is very personal. Whilst class has lost much of its relevance in the UK it has left something of a perverse legacy and people are less inclined to “self- pathologize” their failure, the welfare system assists them to adapt by expecting very little of them for the welfare they receive. They can of course blame the Tory government.\nWhilst the value created by the British economy is like all western economies much lower than the wealth it can generate via its banking system, the effects of the old class system and the generosity of the welfare system take the sting out of peoples sense of personal failure.\nThe role of the economy in creating “wealth” as opposed to “value” is a major contributor to American anger. Wealth is fluid and can like fluid flow only through channels created by people. In America these channels are manufactured by the leaders of the financial system and direct the wealth to those within the system. It is not as American Senator Bernie Sanders says a “casino” system….that is too random. It is a system like the political system in America, designed to maintain the status quo. The old-fashioned Marxist term “Hegemony” i.e. an enclosed system which operates to benefit only certain privileged groups, applies to America more than any other western country. Unlike the UK there is no generous welfare system softening the blow of low achievement and failure.\nWhat the US hegemony delivers, or so we at Blue Revolution believe , is a situation where the poorest become angry and polarised, with low expectations poor state schooling and poor health. Unwilling to accept their personal failure they turn on each other hostile to black people, white people, Hispanics, Jews, Freemasons or just those who seem to be able to ride the wave of wealth that flows through the American economy. The geeky conspiracy theorist no different from the KKK fanatic in the speed at which they get legitimately angry but ignorantly willing to blame another group often irrationally. If one can’t understand what is going on it is easy to be empowered by blaming another racial group.\nPoliticians who have to tap into banker’s wealth to get re-elected and who then get richer on state and federal finance are seen as part of the greater American problem.\nLike the other countries of the west, social value has been supplanted by an obsession with creating mere wealth. In the US more than elsewhere this alchemy of wealth creation doesn’t benefit all people, only the “elite” and the Government. The elite being those who are born into or have made it into this system. Now one point implicit in what we have said but not made explicit yet, is that those who see themselves as the human failures in the American system are genuinely failures of the system. There is no attempt to empower them, educate them, or even wrap them in numbing welfare. They are ghettoised and imprisoned become racists or gangsters determined perhaps to achieve the American dream by making others the failures in their own closed system.\nAll criminals are vulnerable and entitled in the way they achieve status at the expense of others. Prison gets them out of the way but doesn’t take away the “hegemony”; of being in an enclosed system of alienation and poverty, discrimination and abuse to rival the worst third world ghetto.\nThe UK has less of these American problems too because it has a sane attitude towards guns, preventing for the most part those who do become insanely angry about their loss of economic position and opportunity the option of shooting up other people.\nEssentially America espouses bourgeois freedoms which create expectations but offer a system to fulfil them which creates not value but wealth, which is then channelled into the hands of bankers, stockbrokers and those commissioned by government to create weapons to reflect American status on the world stage. The poor in America don’t have the cushioning or numbing effects of seventy years’ worth of welfare, they don’t have a culture that at least is well intentioned if not always successful in driving social progress and inclusion. Whilst the UK has to row back a little in terms of the numbing effects of welfare and like America and the west has to get away from mere wealth creation and move towards a value-based economy.\nAmerica has to move towards a system which is probably unaffordable given the extent of the people problem, ignorance, obesity anger, conspiracy and vested interest up to and including government contracts and political influence mean that for America Secular Westernism will be a hard ideology to shift.\n02.11.15 Do we need a revolution? if so, what type should it be? Red or Blue?\nSome wag once commented that there was no such thing as a free lunch. There is certainly no such thing as a free revolution. Whichever past revolution one selects there is mayhem; destruction, death and the promotion of one special interest group over another, someone pays!\nRevolution, it seems to us at Blue Revolution ushers in one repressive regime, often ousting something out of date muddled and incoherent, but replacing it with something, perhaps more coherent but, if not at least as bad in the short term probably considerably worse. Why this might be is not altogether clear to us (we are not academics, historians etc) but of course things settle down eventually, once society recovers from the “birth pain” of the new order.\nOver the last 2000 years we have progressed in fits and starts but not without pain and bloodshed on mankind’s muddled revolutionary journey.\nIf we look at what is going on now (early 21 century) we see that there are, demographic, religious, economic, political and gender-based tensions, accompanied by a demand for “change” and “something must be done” growing ever shriller.\nWe at Blue Revolution have written about this global anger and have stressed the need to finally move away from economic, racial and biological determinants of social class, caste and position as the best way of healing society and moving us all forward. We thought we had put aside western class-based determinants of social position, but, whilst significantly diminished they are still here, and they too need finally addressing. But how?\nThere are people; and groups of people who would like to engage us all in violent revolution based on the overthrow of the dimming embers of our current class and establishment paradigm. This old-fashioned approach however owes too much to the past and too little to the future. These people seem to demand a spitting and shouting, burning and destroying with Red style Revolution. They, like we, see the fault lines in the west….they see our “Secular Westernism” for example not as a product of the interplay of numerous forces including global economics coupled with faulty individual moral choice and poor judgement, but as the product of a corrupt and corrupting economic system. They want a violent struggle and an overthrow of the past to replace the hated rule of the “corrupt elite” (Banks, right wing governments, industrial conglomerates and Stock holders in particular) with the rule of errrrr…..an elite force of well-intentioned and informed super moral people in super moral governments all somehow financed and licenced to guide plan and steer our lives . However, they don’t stop and think that as part of the past, these people if appointed, would like the rest of us, be part of the problem not the solution. Power, control setting the agenda, limiting freedom would simply replace wealth, control, marketing and restricting opportunities through exclusion.\nThe Red Revolutionaries do have a point…Secular Westernism is bad….it is particularly bad for those at the tail end of societies, societies which are today as corrosive psychologically and socially as in Victorian times the faith- based counterpart was corrosive physically and socially.\nSecular Westernism leads to a moral vacuum corrupting those who have neither the stamina or the self-esteem to hold their nerve, having to manage their lives within its marketplace of unavoidable levels of economic and social uncertainty.\nThe State to mitigate the effects of this moral vacuum has, rather like the Christian faiths of old, provided security, a welfare as opposed to spiritual security that makes the system seem legitimate in the minds of the most vulnerable. This is particularly true of the UK but also to a lesser degree America and elsewhere. So why the current high levels of anger?\nThe west has created a global free market with consumption at its heart……for us therefore it is not capitalist we have moved beyond “Capitalist”. We are now buccaneering free marketeers.\nCapital has actual value owned and controlled by, well “Capitalists”. It is stretching a point too far to say that a made-up stream of central bank, government and credit based ‘funny money’ sloshing around the globe is “Capitalist” in character. There is little real capital around anymore. What we have are systems of wealth creation and wealth allocation which favour certain groups at the expense of others. Some mitigation through welfare is possible, but essentially the free market is both the cause and the cure of the problem. The “problem” being defined as too few people having too much money backed by too little if any real value.\nWhoever you look at who has “loadsamoney” be it Beckham or Trump, pop stars and celebrities, or a person who made their millions selling personalised this or tat related that, the truth is that they have far more money than there is value behind their money; and therein lies the dilemma for our “revolutionaries”. What exactly is being “reallocated” in the revolution…….”funny money!!”\nWhat the Red revolutionaries seem intent on doing; depending on which one you listen to, is empower the government to do what the financial and other markets currently do, but to do it for the benefit of the poor. However as with previous revolutions if they simply replace one busted system with another version of the same system, they fail to progress society and in the case of our spitting taunting shouting and burning Red Revolutionaries they will replace one group of power and wealth grabbers (let’s say Bankers) paid for with funny money with another, let’s say state officials, paid for by funny money. The moral hazard associated with this funny money continuing to make people both idle and entitled and increasingly unproductive. The process will survive until the Government, or rather the people go under. Not so different than the current risk of individuals eventually going under. Same destination….different route and scale so to speak.\nNow here at Blue Revolution HQ the Blue Revolution approach is just as radical but considerably more difficult to explain, but we think better informed. Of course anyone who reads our posts will know we are no fans of the corrosion inflicted by Secular Westernism, with it’s under regulated global free market undermining personal and public morals. Its lack of moral hazard forging societies which don’t resemble civilizations and alienate and makes enemies of people who, quite understandably, but illogically, find answers to the west’s problems in old world type discriminations. People for whom control and discrimination (gender, faith racial sexual orientation, nationality etc.) are the solution and who all too often and perversely become the bedfellows of the Red Revolution as they all want to “change the system” by force.\nThe Blue Revolution takes as its starting point the fact that wealth and value share little in common these days. They have since we learnt to store value been different; one depending on the other (wealth depending on value) but in a ratio which was on a human scale. Now wealth is out of control and is consuming value as fast as it can be pumped out of the ground, harvested, built over or manufactured. The slush of wealth corrupts life and bloats expectations, creating the moral vacuum in which we all co-exist and which taints all of us.\nThe Blue Revolution is not a violent revolution, it is the nearest thing to a free lunch. It asks everyone who can think and has the capacity to control and modify their behaviour to do so on the basis of certain principles; down scaling expectations, have belief in the capacity of people to do good and actually do good; behave in a thoughtful and moral way putting back and not just taking out. An act of kindness, selfless and unrewarded is the simplest form of “value added”. Recognise that wealth, our wealth and that of others, is of no value unless it is backed up by hard work rather than luck, over confidence and the vagaries of the market.\nWe must also moreover recognise that if the Government must bail us out it is the nation’s people bailing ourselves out. With better regulation by government we as consumers can use our power to influence the market, to bring about the necessary change in the hope our improved outlook translates via the free market into change and acts to inspire others.\nThe Blue Revolution is the real “power to the people” not a committee of ministers and senior Civil Servants with over publicised agitators, acting on behalf of the people. We have this power because we have the free markets, the last thing we want is that power diminished by a traditional left wing, well intentioned, ill-informed but creating an emboldened state. The state for all its positives, when it becomes too powerful, will make too many of us just a little angrier, and some people are angry enough.\n05.11.15 The final deadly Sin: Immodesty\nWe started this process of describing the modern “seven deadly Sins back in April 2015. The idea was to link some personal behaviours over which we all have control to the concept of corrupting “Secular Westernism” which is the Blue Revolution description of the self-destructive “it’s all about me” morality that undermines western culture.\nThe idea is to try and make the point that many of us will have taken our freedom and with it contributed to the decline of western standards of public morality. The consequence is in our view a reduction in social and economic value, both of which are essential for the health and sustainability of all economies and communities. In the west wealth has become a very poor substitute for social and economic value. However, wealth unlike social and economic value flows into the hands of too few people. The solution is not to redistribute wealth but to demand the creation of social and economic value; the Blue Revolution so to speak.\nOur seven deadly sins are global sins, but they are particularly relevant to the modern western culture. They leave individuals at risk of being exploited and yet also prone to exploit others. The western world’s global “Hegemony” based as it is on creating too much valueless wealth, makes sinners of too many of us. Of relevance is our final Sin.\nOur final is also our most widely committed and most controversial sin although by no means our worst; it is immodesty. Let us examine this in more detail beginning with immodesty in places where you may not expect to see it.\nModesty is a universal requirement of faith. Most if not all faiths require us to cover up, be calm and temperate, and to behave in a modest and restrained way. Virtually every culture in the modern world has found a way around this, (it is in many ways the most pervasive of sin) and it includes the immodest braying of fundamentalists of all hues.\nIn Africa and the Middle East, the hateful criticism of other faiths and ways of life from Christians criticizing Gays to the Sunni Muslim Monarchy in Saudi Arabia banning all other faiths but Islam. American televangelists promising wealth and salvation if you part with your money. Each shows an arrogance that is ill befitting of faith; a self-regard and easy default position that everyone else is wrong. Ones sympathy with the North African Migrants starts to evaporate when one observes young men swaggering across Europe demanding a new life uninvited, aggressive and bearing the entitled attitude and angry expression of our own entitled from top publicly paid officials like MP’s to bankers to some welfare recipients.\nThe ancient behaviours of averting one’s eyes and prostrating oneself, open palm gestures and respectful speech, modest dress codes etc which in the west became symbolic of “good manners” all show how important it is to show respect through modest behaviour. Modesty really is universal. To behave in a modest way promotes social harmony and cohesion and a respect for others within and outside our personal relationships. It also promotes a positive and safe social context within which crime could be much lower and economic and social activity would be much higher. In a world of gender equality such as we have in the west, the biggest threat to the individual comes from their own and others immodest behaviour. So, to all we would encourage a revival of modesty in cultural and economic life.\nAny discussion of immodesty can’t ignore the fact that when it comes to industrial scale immodesty it becomes “part of our way of life” and it undermines us in the eyes of others. No one in modern times does immodesty quite like “the west”. Immodesty promoted via the internet is a blind spot for the individuals and the western culture in general. We are all ‘at it’.\nWe don’t want to labour the obvious point but people from most cultures who observe the west see nakedness as a symptom of something going badly wrong, particularly when the wests sexually saturated culture is viewed as both arousing and yet repellent by a more traditional world.\nThe freedoms we enjoy, our generally fair treatment of one another, our belief that people can reform, and should be treated with compassion are all overlooked as the focus moves onto our casual attitudes towards marriage and relationships, our pornography our widespread obsession with looks and celebrity. Cure this and the west will genuinely become a good and moral place unequalled for fairness, respect and equality. But if to “cure it” means taking away the freedom to do immodest things and behave in an immodest way then it’s not worth it. This is rule book morality a regime. Therefore, we can’t expect government to “put things right”; it is up to us.\nThe answer is, as with all our sins, simply not to indulge in them. The Blue Revolution is not about telling people what to do but is about showing anyone who is interested that to preserve the best of what we have we need to avoid the worst places that our culture will allow us to go. If I am modest in what I do it may rub off and other people may be modest in what they do.\nAs a society if we begin to control our behaviour, our generally good culture will become better. Over time a culture which unfortunately encourages some of us to misbehave will slowly modify; a process of slow almost invisible change will take place.\nThe world which discriminates and abuses to enforce moral behaviour will observe that in the west you don’t have to mutilate and punish, discriminate and control, kill and maim to ensure that society creates the maximum amount of social and economic value possible; it happens because in the west we have grown out of the impulse to be immodest. Evidence of this can be measured by the extent to which we have exorcised the demons of celebrity and gross planet consuming over consumption. Let us start this revolution now. Lets avoid the seven modern deadly sins.\n10.11.15 The great immigration debate- good or bad?\nDavid Cameron the UK Prime Minister has spelt out that he believes the basis of the UK’s negotiation with the EU should be prior to the much-vaunted referendum sometime between May 2016 and Nov 2017. The four negotiating points consist of the political, social and economic but without doubt the most controversial contains elements of all three. His demand to limit the access to “in work” benefits for migrant workers is causing ripples of applause and muted heckling from both sides of the debate. Too radical for some not radical enough for others. As we move towards the referendum, we at Blue Revolution will give an opinion on in or out; however, for the moment let us consider the immigration issue.\nThere is no doubt that the shift from “free movement of labour” to the “free movement of people” has caused a gearing up of numbers coming here from Eastern Europe. However, we must not forget that in the 1970’s and 1980’s the flow of Labour was from Britain to amongst other places Germany and from the 1990’s onwards the free movement of people was to amongst other places Spain and France. We have taken advantage of the borderless arrangements in Europe so should not be surprised when others want to come here. Left leaning Policy forums are claiming that in addition to the principle of free movement being a good thing as we benefit from it too, migrants also “add value to the British economy”. Now this is a very controversial claim…or so we think.\nFirstly, anyone familiar with Blue Revolution will know we are a little obsessed with “Value”. For us the whole purpose of society is to create social and economic value to enable the survival of our culture and in the west to ensure the continuation of equality, consent, choice and contract as the heart of an expanded democracy. To ensure this we need to avoid the pitfalls and temptations of secular westernism and the seven deadly sins. So how does migration interface with our aspirations for western culture as experienced in the UK….it will be different in other places of course.\nIn the UK we have a culture and economy which is heavily reliant on the state to provide income for workers, services for service users and benefits for those who are unable or unwilling to work. Housing, education, and heath provide a minimum level of intervention for those who need it and we have a humane and fair system of justice with help for those in need. We are however burdened by an economy which has driven out skill and driven down wages to the minimum and locks those wage levels in place with a supply of willing labour; keen to benefit from the above. This arrangement suits too many people in different ways. The welfare recipients don’t have to work; wages are too low to incentivise gainful employment and in any event if you have to claim “Tax Credits” rather than out of work benefits, you won’t be so much better off, so it fails to make that early morning start in mid-winter worthwhile.\nThe rest of the stuff on offer; healthcare etc, is available to everyone anyway, worker or not. So, within the context of employment there is a major downside to mass immigration a downside in the form of depressed wages, British workers or potential workers dislocated by choice and from the active labour market. This is an unforeseen social engineering nightmare the social costs of which are pregnancy, single parenthood, depressed adults, low aspiration and unemployment. If there were less mass immigration wage levels would be driven up and there would be benefits to the economy and society. There would be greater levels employment amongst the indigenous British due to higher wages and there would be lower levels of the social problems identified above.\nThat it is the “left” who peddle the notion that immigration from Eastern Europe is positive is slightly perverse.\nWhat the left fail to take into account of is that the wealth distributed in welfare to migrant workers does not create economic value, simply personal wealth and company profits, through subsidize low wages, and it adversely drives out for many British people their capacity to maintain high levels of social value independence, resilience and social responsibility for example. Less widely discussed but also relevant is the issue of housing demand; arguably we need more housing to house both migrant workers as well as our own economically inactive people many of whom have children and come from broken families. We also have our workers to house many of whom also have broken families too. Perversely house building and a ‘buoyant’ housing market create the illusion of economic growth; hence the governments obsession with it. Of course, this analysis we believe applies to Germany and France Sweden as well as the UK.\nWhat about the other “old Chestnut” immigration as a driver for genuine economic growth? We have referred to housing demand creating an impression of real growth, but in our opinion house building has simply short-term benefits and does not add long term value. Housing feeds into the asset inflation mirage of growth, looks good on paper but like stock values is just froth, masquerading as real value. growth. Economic growth therefore must be more than building houses for a growing population of those with housing needs including migrants.\nHaving to understand the term migrant is also a challenge. There are many types, (EU, Non-EU, Illegal immigrant, Refugee, Student, legitimate non-EU immigrant, Asylum Seeker) but the group almost universally cited by left and right wing alike as having had a positive impact (i.e. value creating) is the pre-war migrant who “made good” and contributed to Britain’s post war economic boom. These were predominantly Jewish migrants fleeing Nazi Germany.\nIn the context of modern migration this clam needs some analysis. Firstly, we do believe that the post war economy grew as a result of pre-war immigration. Highly skilled men and women with ability who were driven from their homes by a genocidal regime and came to Britain escaping to freedom, created value both social and economic. Many were wealthy and well connected and talented; but not exclusively so. These migrants are used as evidence to support the idea of widespread mass immigration today. But regrettably the situation is not the same. Much as the political class wish it were.\nModern migrants are not on the whole wealthy or highly skilled…of course there are some who are. They are also coming here in huge numbers far greater than in the past. Many fleeing crumbling economies in North Africa bring their faith which has different expectations of how as a society Britain should create and preserve its economic and social value offering a rule-based regime with expectations and entitlements based on sex for example or tradition such as halal slaughter. For many of these newly arrived there is too much reliance on the service and hospitality sector and within this overcrowded sector a reliance develops on government financial business support.\nSo, what are we left with? There is no doubt migration can be very positive. The value of migration to the British economy and society in general depends upon who is coming and what values and skills they bring with them as well as how many come. To detach the issue from social and economic realities of value creation and preservation as the “something must be done” people or the immigration is simply about ‘diversity’ people believe, is utterly naïve. There is evidence of good and bad in respect of migration, but you need to look more analytically at what is really going on socially as well as economically.\nWhat seems interesting to us is that with modern technology and transport there is no need for people to leave their culture of origin; they can connect and re connect anywhere and whilst this may promote a view that the host culture is alien and needs change it also allows the notion of location to be separated from the notion of nationality and cultural identity. In many ways we are free to be anywhere and the idea that we have to locate permanently anywhere is absurd, if you can’t cut it socially and economically where you are… it is not that difficult to go home and maybe you should not have left in the first place.\n13.11.15 Jihadi John and moral confusion; can we help?\nJihadi John killed in a drone attack; one view is good riddance the other regrets the lack of a trial and “proper” justice. two conflicted views. The Americans show the usual lack of restraint and treat the death of one pathetic if psychotic individual as though it is the climax of the battle and in so doing demonstrate exactly the kind of western hubris that should antagonises people on all sides of the moral debate as well as unintentionally harden the resolve of ISIS to get their own back. Tone it down a bit guys!\nThere are enough innocent westerners in these war zones to kidnap and behead to avenge the death of Jihadi John, so we should show restraint in our success to avoid provoking more bloodletting. One of our Seven Deadly Sins (the things that make modern western culture problematic to those of all faith and some of no faith) is immodesty and it is a characteristic of the swaggering ISIS too. Irrespective of the way he was dispatched, we should restrain our impulse to gloat at his death. He represented nothing good and his death should not be significant either.\nNow the subject of whether we should have put him on trial rather than execution by drone is interesting we think; The liberals in the west and ISIS themselves should not necessarily expect a proper trial for people like Jihadi John. Jihadi John lived in a chaotic and cruel dustbowl. A place where economic and social value is eroded by barbarism and a lack of coherent economic ambition. A trial would have been impossible for practical reasons (arresting him?) and it would be impossible to make a trial meaningful for those who support the ISIS cause. Justice has to be if nothing else a reminded to all that the values of civilization have been breached and the process of justice and the sanction are an example of right being re-established or restored in the face of whatever was wrong; dishonesty, violence or evil.\nIn the case of Jihadi John and the criminals of ISIS they do not see western justice as re-establishing the values of civilisation but the exercising of infidel justice on the virtuous warriors of Islamic State. On that basis it is naive to think that any good can come of our imposing our justice, however benign, on them. They do not value what we value and have set themselves against the culture of the west and elsewhere; cultures that are to varying degrees more likely to respect the individual and believe we should work peacefully together to grow together through co-operation greater social and economic value……things of which they have declared a violent hatred.\nGiven this perspective it is right to ask why in the west perspectives are so conflicted about the right response to Jihadi John; a humane if naïve judicial response or a gloating aggressive one; typical of reductive polarisation. We at Blue Revolution believe that it is because the west does not have a clear and coherent view of what the basis should be for western justice in the 21st century. After all the west is a bit of a moral shambles itself as we never tire of pointing out, greed, arrogance and stupidity on an industrial scale create major social problems in the west. Our Blue Revolution is our preferred response to this calamity but the fact there is a moral calamity means getting a moral perspective is quite hard.\nHowever there may be a way forward; we don’t think many would disagree with us that the aim of any civilized community (at any point in history) including in the west (with the exception the major lapse of moral judgement in the Bush/Blair years) is to preserve value, be it social or economic in nature. ISIS put themselves outside the culture of any legitimate nation or state because it does not believe in preserving the legacy of the past for the benefit of the future. It destroys the past and the value that belongs from the past so it can’t be used to help society evolve socially, culturally or economically. Therefore they do not deserve to have any more than the minimum amount of scarce human and economic and social value deployed to remove their crazy life limiting and soul destroying ideology….the fewer of us who are harmed or the least time wasted in that process the better. ISIS are sad, mad and bad and they need to be eroded but let us not bray about it…let us just quietly get on with it; it is a bit like having to put down a violent dog.\n17.11.15 Terrorism in France – “something must be done”\nHave you ever driven the wrong way down a motorway? No neither have we; however, we imagine it would be very scary once you had worked out what was going on. The rhetorical question you might ask would be “oh shit something must be done” and “how can I deal with this FFS”. These are question’s the French specifically and the west generally are asking in the aftermath of the French terror attacks.\nThe Journey down the motorway would have started easily enough no cause for concern, nothing to worry about; I might have been 3am and the roads were clear at the start. However, as mile upon mile passed the slow realisation that something didn’t add up would have dawned and eventually you have traffic travelling towards you at 70 miles an hour to contend with. At which point there are two choices; panic or evaluate the threat properly. What you could not do is blame the road, or blame the other traffic, swerve around or brake hard. Neither could you carry on oblivious to the risk. This is a very self-inflicted problem.\nThe above feels to us like the situation Europe faces now it has woken up to the fact it has allowed it’s continent to become, in places at least, the nearest thing you can get to a caliphate. The European political elite, comfortable, multi lingual, and living off he labour of ordinary Europeans have from civilised subsidized citadels, allowed their “splendid isolation” to blind them the obvious fact that many who come here from North Africa do not share our values and are appalled by what we do with our freedoms. So faced with Paris what is the solution having finally worked out that we have been travelling the wrong way down the motorway for the last two decades or more?\nFirstly, we cannot jam on the brakes; we are travelling at 70 miles an hour. We cannot carry on either as we must deal with the threats from other traffic or eventually, we will have an accident. We need to think about how we safely turn around or pull over put the hazard light’s on to make ourselves and others safe and get out of the danger zone and not repeat the same stupid mistake again.\nOur Blue Revolution recognizes the march towards a common culture will happen over time and should be organic in character. So, in many respects driving the wrong way onto the slip road was an easy mistake for most western countries to make. The idea that cultural convergence would be a product of simple mass migration is an easy justification for mass immigration. What is there to worry about?\nHowever, the Blue Revolutionaries at Blue Revolution link cultural convergence to the production of the collective social and economic value within a modern context of freedom and equality based on contract, choice and consent. This is the bit that all western countries fail to recognise. Convergence is not simply about “celebrating diversity” or “being PC” as has been the belief since the mid 1990’s. It’s not about ghettoising migrants who have been “rescued” or “allowed to remain”. Cultural convergence is not about closing boarders to migrants either. We don’t want to speed up on the motor way or jam the brakes on. We must have a controlled and measured response.\nSo here the west there are all these countries, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden even the US and others all driving the wrong way down the motorway, it all looks ok for some time, no one had until recently seen the on-coming truck because the road was empty. However now we need to deal with the issue. But how?\nFirstly, that seven or eight deranged psychopaths can cause so much carnage is something to exercise the minds of western leaders and westerners in general. As is the level of fear that eight people generate. The evidence from Paris would suggest that there was an element of “making the targets up as they went along”. They had the guns, the bomb making capability and the hatred, but the targets were last minute. They hadn’t got tickets to the match! So, two blew themselves up quite safely! The idea of an ISIS mastermind is therefore unlikely. More a general position of “we hate the west, here are some bombs and guns go and destroy the infidel”. This is both a worry and a reassurance. More planning would leave a detectable trail. Organized with the sheer amateurishness of the planning here means they strike out of the blue.\nSo, the first thing we suggest is not to exaggerate the ability of any one to detect what is likely to happen. Agencies might foil plots, but they might not. To change a way of life beyond recognition probably isn’t worth it in the long term; a bit like a meat and alcohol-free diet you might live longer but it will be a hard life. The second point is that to police and to protect will impede the economy and although western economies produce too little value for the amount they spend. The west needs to continue to produce value both social and economic value and you can’t do this in a police state.\nThe second point is that we need to develop a shared “narrative” with people from all faiths and none and identify a way of linking with international partners which isn’t a rerun of the cold war but neither is clouded in denial about what those with whom we partner get up to behind their own boarders. This “narrative” cannot be the usual western fetish about “democracy” great though democracy is.\nAt Blue Revolution we link our blue revolution to three key elements; upon which democracy can be based but so can other ways of ordering society. We believe that Contract, Choice and Consent practiced between all adults is the defining benchmark of a civilised post enlightenment society; whether democracy or not. If countries allow relationships between adults to be governed by the 3 C’s then eventually democracy and freedom with begin to flourish.\nThe next point is that social and economic value is as much the victim of war as the lives of people killed. Therefore, the adventures of Blair and Bush destroyed too much social and economic value in Iraq for the aims they set themselves, namely “regime change”. On this basis going after IS needs to be proportionate to the long- term aim of preserving enough social and economic value to enable communities to heal. However, the destruction of IS, is essential as they are themselves destroying the very social and economic value they seek to conquer.\nFinally, the Blue Revolution is not just about the values of others; it is about the crazy behaviour in the west too; “secular westernism” as we call it. Any society which promotes or ignores the undesirable consequences of our seven deadly sins, is promoting secular westernism. It is not as dangerous as Islamism or fascism or Stalinist communism but is its own way it is equally as corrosive. Secular westernism undermines social value and compromises the ability to create and maintain economic value and gives the enemies of the western world plenty of things to hate us for…..and after Paris; hate us, too many seem to do, even if it is only a handful, it’s a handful too many.\n23.11.15 Secular Westernism- who are the Secular Westernists?\nThe last week and a half have been dominated by France and Belgium specifically and the threat from their friendly neighbourhood caliphates generally. The phrase Islamism and Islamist to describe those who advocate violence to others to further the ambitions of violent social and economic degeneration is becoming common place. We are also at last beginning to get a worldwide perspective on ISIS and their violent hostility to the universal goal of humanity which is bind people together by faith and culture, so they create the social and economic value necessary to enable them to survive.\nThe future of evolution is peoples of all faiths and cultures working to the same end. ISIS stand apart from this “law of nature” and destroy value and the capacity of mankind to create more value by their violence and a rigid social code that only works if your aspiration is to live in a cave and scratch out a living in the desert. Or you are an oil rich monarchy.\nHowever, whilst the west lacks the criminality, cruelty and violence of the Islamists, the Islamists may not be the only ones misunderstanding value and limiting mankind’s capacity to create more. The west has a more subtle approach to undermining the creation of value; it is hard to see and problematic to tackle as it has become the wests economic orthodoxy. It is what we call Secular Westernism something others have called the “western hegemony”.\nWe use the Blue Revolutionary term Secular Westernism as we believe that amongst every level of western society (elite to unskilled worker) there are the foot-soldiers of the Secular Western hegemony. It is as much personal as structural. Let’s call its advocates Secular Westernists. In contrast to the Islamist the Secular Westernist achieves undesirable outcomes by simply pursuing personal self-interest within a moral vacuum that lacks a faith based or Darwinian imperative to create the social and economic value necessary for society to evolve.\nWe talked about the seven deadly sins as the kind of behaviours which when practiced on an industrial scale have negative consequences on society as a whole; but we can add to the seven deadly sins the belief that wealth is a substitute for value, that the more wealth you have the more valuable you are and that wealth is “real” and is not a variable financial figure based on confidence or hubris overheating various markets.\nTo the Secular Westernist wealth being “real” is more important than human relationships or producing economic value. To a Secular Westernist wealth made by producing pornography is “real” wealth rather than simply money earned by producing something which has no objective value. Try and think of other examples; making money by selling personalised number plates for example or offering sex phone lines or even ‘shorting’ within the equities markets.\nAdd to this the fact that the various financial crises are evidence that when stock values collapse people loose wealth; there is no objective value there then and worryingly pensions depend on it.\nThis stuff is hard to understand but you need to think about how much of what a rich person has, is based on something real and how much is simply what they have borrowed or blagged or made by selling to the desperate, ill-informed or plain stupid, and is therefore the froth on the economy rather than the economy itself.\nThe challenge for the Secular Westernist and enlightened western governments as well as the Blue Revolutionary is to simultaneously see the “free market” as both the cause and the cure for Secular Westernism, and to see many of the great western general public as the foot-soldiers of the western hegemony; blindly promoting it, rather than being the “victims” of an evil system that only a governments of the red revolutionary type can overthrow.\nA British minister asked how many decades until a British worker works as hard as a Chinese worker, 10,20, 30 years. The answer is as long as it takes the western worker to understand that getting rich is no substitute for creating value either social or economic ……..and how long will that be? Perhaps we need to start by understanding more about value and desiring less personal wealth.\n24.11.15 You can take the Islamist out of the dust bowl, but you can’t take the dust bowl out of the Islamist\nYou can take the Islamist out of the dust bowl; but you can’t take the dust bowl out of the Islamist. This corruption of a British industrial working class saying has so much relevance for our understanding of the origins of Islamism. Indeed, it may help us to understand the passive support violent Islamists receive from the ordinary Muslim faithful and indeed perhaps the world’s Leninist left wing who offer sympathy to the economic underdogs of the world’s dustbowl economies. This Left wing believing the west is wholly to blame for North African poverty rather than seeing it as a combination of geography, greed, discrimination and corruption often with the overt connivance of the west.\nEssentially as we have argued before, too many nations that profess Islam as their nation’s faith adopt it as a ‘dust bowl religion’ in respect of its reaction to social and economic justice. It could all too easily occupy a place where making a living was (is) hard and precarious and where value (the product of economic and social activity) could be easily destroyed by war, crime and famine.\nThis sort of society would be coherent with Islam. In such an environment it would of necessity be hard and uncompromising; high expectations and harsh punishment for disobedience. The separation of social and economic roles would be applied, and women’s role would be crystalized as social as opposed to economic in character and subject to the guidance of men. This would meet the needs of society and its economy, but it would leave little scope to evolve.\nFirstly, such an economy would produce too little value and what value it did create was, as in all societies of the era except tribal ones, acquired by overlords. The faith was rigid economically excluding of women and hierarchical; but it worked and in dust bowls to this day still does. Blair and Bush’s folly was not understanding this when waging war in the middle east.\nWe would argue that when an Islamist comes to the west, they don’t see opportunity they probably see sinning on a grand scale. Their reaction is to reject “our way of life” and some; the most psychotic, take up arms to purify our culture of sinfulness. The fact that our freedoms create medicine, art, engineering and so on and so forth doesn’t occur to them, they are obsessed by the obscene freedoms the west has whilst looking enviously at the west’s wealth. Look around the middle east and you see absolutist kingdoms, wealth being held by monarchs and tyrants, you see a desire for hierarchy, authority and a somewhat hypocritical desire (amongst males) for purity. You don’t see values such as Contract, Choice and Consent which for us at a Blue Revolution HQ was the first rung on the ladder towards equality, freedom and democracy for all. And we still have some way to go.\nSo, whilst we have much to criticize the west about (too much superficial culture and wealth) it can’t be faulted for the commitment from all countries to Contract Choice and Consent. These three concepts need to be understood and promoted by all those who want to “fit” into the west. When someone from North Africa is able to demonstrate that they understand these three basic building blocks of freedom and can apply them in their day to day lives, they will clearly have taken the dust bowl out of their beliefs. Of how many Saudi princelings could one say that?",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_are-the-liberal-elite-naive-stupid-or-evil-or-all-three-we-consider-the-evidence/content_354.html": "Are the “liberal elite” naive, stupid or evil…..or all three. We consider some evidence. V2\nThe liberal elite; those custodians of our two party state and binary Parliamentary system have come in for a rough time recently. It’s been one disaster after another with the most recent being the inability of most of them to call the recent General Election result. The binary two party system with its fetishizing of adversarial politics has started to fail because it is reliant on promoting tribal self-interest underpinned by a docile and obliging population encouraged to see the benefits of buying into the benign state idea but only as long as the “State” works for them. The British Broadcasting Corporation colludes shamelessly with the political party elites and far from swerving allegations of “bias” actively promote bias against new entrants to the political system. They are allowed to do this by the absence of law preventing it, we presume to encourage “strong” government.\nUnfortunately, they are naive to think this is the right way of doing politics in the 21st century. In a socially engineered pluralist and diverse nation shoehorning opinion into two camps creates the very environment for apathy and the slogan politics so loved of the hard left and far right. It leaves most people feeling angry and un represented but no one from moderate left or right will challenge it or the right of public bodies like the BBC to promote it with their lazy “reductive polarities” masquerading as debate. It won’t be challenged because huge party political bureaucracies will decline and with their decline will decline opportunities for lobbying, promoting vested interests and the maintenance of the self-interest of politicians themselves. Just like UKIP has declined so would the Labour Party and Tories if the paradigm was to be broken, as of course, it should be. It is clearly time for a change.\nSo that is the nieve bit. The belief by the elite that the Westminster or Washington political machine an essentially 18th-century systems still work for the benefit of the many, not the few. Of course, it works after a fashion, but only for them! The many find themselves paying for the few and that few includes Corbyn’s Labour party. So what about stupidity?\nWell, having created a diverse cultural community which in some social and economic contexts has worked against the interests of the indigenous working classes and moreover having done it within a collapsing or indeed collapsed capitalist system, the liberal elite has allowed a new type of business environment to develop, the post industrial “free market”. This new business model relies on indebtedness to create wealthy people via mass consumption by poorer people plus bogus state investment like HS2, mass housing, welfare etc. The state itself, of course, spends billions on maintaining its own army of £100K+ consumers both employed and retired. All This government spending or waste is of course paid for by tax payers and their children’s children. The economics are bad enough but the morality which goes with this system blows a great big hole in any notion of moral convergence towards a liberal moral consensus. It promotes the sale of immorality as a fashion accessory. However, to avoid the calamity of moral conflict, moral relativism comes to the rescue for the liberal elite. They thus ignore people with appalling moral ideas that would if heard offend them, they simply don’t ask the questions.\nIn the world of the “stupid” liberal elite, no one considers the implications of a planet gobbling free market commodifying everything for consumption including families, relationships, even peoples genitalia on porn channels is marketed aggressively. TV shows like “Love Island” or “Naked Attraction” become a good recruitment film for domestic ISIS sympathisers. As abroad ISIS struggle to maintain their “rubble” age culture they see that we in the west are morally no better than them. But they would satisfy themselves that there is religiously sanctioned male authority underpinning their abuse, as opposed to the moral free for all that reflects our low moral “free market” standards. They recognise the extent of the excrement of western civilisation in a way we can’t and rather than see our Shakespeare and Mozart as reference points for Western culture they see only our “shame” and they, of course, believe they have the answer to our shame and sinfulness.\nTo the stupid liberal elite, all this is Ok. People can be free to waste their hard borrowed money on consumer tatt whilst the elite cream off our debt as income and lord it over the increasingly impoverished masses. The stupid elite doesn’t see that the middle, lower middle and working classes are in decline as more of them through indebtedness and paying for education and “care” morph imperceptibly into the new pauper class, the now fabled underclass. The underclass is a horrible term for a class created by the political elite from industrial and agricultural workers who had their jobs exported and class consciousness undermined. Debt and the immorality funded by debt, plus the underclass funded by welfare offends many who are religious or observant. Drunk feral women for example, or drunk feral men not only outrage public decency they are a rallying point for the demand for a new strict moral framework that advocates sanctions which are not only pre industrial they are almost pre Biblical. But the stupid elite doesn’t see that. They turn a blind eye and keep on forking out taxpayers cash to maintain demand and GDP.\nThe state of western culture may explain the casual way a few second and third generation immigrants of perhaps Pakistani or North African descent in 21st century Britain will refer to stonings and amputations as a way of tackling these essentially “moral” social problems. To the Elite the underclass is a class in need of health care and welfare to the intolerant religious bigot they are an irrelevant social nuisance, a nuisance to be controlled or eradicated. When confronted by the reality of their underclass the liberal elite quickly move on. No Tim Farron type interrogations of the Muslim faithful from them. It might prove them to have been at best nieve and at worst stupid, creating their “diversity” and then tolerating sexual and racial discrimination within that diversity and finally giving up any notion they understand the social and political environment they have created.\nAnd that brings us nicely to evil. Is any of this, as the lawyers would say, done with intent. Well, much of it is, unfortunately. The liberal elite will avoid any “narrative” that would question the legitimacy of the Saudi’s to buy our weapons whilst promoting with their savage technological feudal system; stonings, crucifixions and beheadings. They also know that it is the poor and increasingly the middle classes who are getting into debt either by themselves or with the connivance of the state. We have seen wars and financial crises but one thing is always clear, once debt is monetized in the hands of the wealthy it becomes their passport to a new life, a life in a sunny part of the world where morality might be strict, and far away from “Love Island” and the workless underclass but where wealth buys privilege for those who can behave themselves and can afford it. Think Blair et al.\nWithin our western culture, the elite is slowly bankrupting us, undermining our values with welfare and a lack of proper economically valuable employment or valuable social employment, destroying our planet and creating a political environment that could herald a return to discrimination, hatred and fear via polararised debate. When it happens, when the western hegemony collapses, the rich and their elites will abandon us to what ever fate befalls our once hardworking, decent and tolerant culture. Nieve stupid or evil? Probably all three.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_what-is-wrong-with-the-british-public-sector/content_61.html": "What is wrong with the British Public Sector?\nWhat is wrong with the public sector?\nMost people feel that the public sector is in crisis, with low staff morale, poor service delivery and too much bureaucracy. The question is can anything be done to improve things and what is the cause of the vast array of problems it faces?\nThe Public Sector used to be an eccentric collection of largely autonomous departments of State and Local Government. It was efficient and whilst Salaries were low compared to similar posts in the private sector, the work carried a pension which was seen by staff as giving long-term security. people were also loyal to the concept of public service. Much of the Public Sector from the 1940s to the 1980s reflected the values of the post-war settlement. The Public Sector was financed by taxation for the benefit of everyone. Its basic values therefore would have tilted towards equality, fairness plus accountability, not to a bureaucratic elite but to elected representatives on Boards and committees. The public sector, therefore, tilted away from principles of elitism in favour of functionalism that delivered services to the public. This all started to change with the arrival in the 1980s of a growing belief that the model was inefficient because what went on was largely immeasurable. It coincided of course with the development of data. and growing faith in the ability of free market principles of unfairness, inequality and particularly managerial elitism, to deliver better measured and managed services to the public, but at what cost to the staff? Let us explore what has happened from Prime Ministers Major to Johnson via Blair and Brown.\nA characteristic of the old public sector, therefore, particularly in local authorities was that it tended to have hierarchies with few levels within its hierarchies, between those at the top and those at the ‘delivery end’. The system worked because everyone knew their role within departments and they had clearly defined professional boundaries, within which they operated autonomously. They had time to become experts at what they did. As they were relatively flat hierarchies, career progression was the exception rather than the expectation. Those who did ‘get on’ usually did so on the basis they were knowledgeable and experienced, generally respected, and likeable. All very simple.\nSince then, however, there have been significant developments changing the culture and nature of the public sector. These changes are based on a belief that the public sector required free-market principles to make it efficient. It has gone from being a simple collection of diverse but skilful departments, staffed by experienced professionals, into a data, training obsessed, and micromanaged behemoth that no longer serves the needs of those who work in it or those who rely on it and of course pay for it..\nSo, what has gone wrong? When the public sector was being expanded or in some instances ‘nationalised’ after the Second World War the only organisational model in existence was the industrial business model. The industrial business model, based as it is on capitalist principles has elitism and unfairness characterised by top-down control of workers. However, the layers of management and ancillary departments support whatever is the core business activity of the organisation.\nAny manufacturing firm may need Human Resources, training, and finance departments, or it can buy these in from elsewhere. All these ancillary roles create costs but must not impede key business. They must continue to allow control of business risk from the Board of Directors at the top, through managers to ensure the prosperity of the firm. Altogether the aim is efficiency, making a successful firm that makes a profit, can support its ancillary departments, take risks, and not spectacularly fail.\nIn the earliest iteration of the public sector (I am excluding the military which has structures requiring different command and control needs) the application of this industrial model, whilst ‘top down’ was reasonably flat and lightly managed. Profit wasn’t a preoccupation. It didn’t need to be. Workers were classified by their role for example practitioner or senior practitioner of this or that department, and a Chief Officer with maybe a couple of ranks in between, maybe a deputy to the Chief Officer. All colleagues would know the purpose of the department they worked in and would gain decades of experience in, for example, protecting children, managing offenders, providing housing, maintaining highways or upkeeping Parks and Gardens. From the 1940s until the end of the twentieth century this model worked reasonably well but even back then did and still does have difficulties that have been used by a newly created public sector elite to define its failures today.\nFirst among the old public sectors difficulties was that the model had no inbuilt ‘check’ on inefficiency, such as loss-making, or going bankrupt as is the case in the private sector. But given the public service values back then this was less of an issue. Wages were typically lower than in the private sector. In the past, the public sector and private sectors were recognised as different, with very different sets of values.\nOnce the public sector was uncoupled from its quaint ideas of public service or ‘vocation’ the new commercial ethos introduced bit by bit by Governments from the late 1980s onwards, has spawned not efficiency but bureaucracy and oppressive management. The public sector and its workers were never inefficient enough to justify the imposition of commercial principles. But that didn’t stop the trend from gaining momentum.\nThe aim of introducing a kind of free market discipline was to ensure that worker performance could be monitored, measured, and therefore managed. No longer does a local team deliver a service, knowing what is required of it by an informed public, the whole process is overmanaged by ‘Boards’, senior managers, and performance analysts. These people are remote from the front line, promote their career ambitions and create growth in non-core areas of business such as irrelevant training which leads to muddle, anxiety, and a loss of focus on what ‘core’ activity is.\nTo each ‘head’ or senior ‘leader’, their bit of activity within the organisation can be treated as a ‘core’ activity, whether that activity is ‘core’ i.e., Protecting Children from Harm, or less ‘core’ activity such as training staff, managing Human Resources, Data Management, or Quality Assurance. The actual core business gets lost among too many priorities. Department heads in the public sector now compete for resources, human and financial, keen to secure ‘investment for their bit of the organisation.\nThe next key problem for the public sector is the development of the accountability framework as a substitute for the health check of profit and loss in a private firm.’ If in the private sector core business is disinvested in, company losses will follow. Accountability frameworks inflicted on the public sector by successive governments since the late 1980s don’t work in the same way. When core staff can see problems but have no power to resource core business, it causes stress and crisis on the front line. The consequence of this model is staff being overmanaged to deliver unachievable targets for the organisation and the organisation’s bonus-obsessed ‘senior leaders. Absence and disillusionment quickly become systemic.\nThe response from management is More training and accountability to cope with problems caused by accountability colliding with a lack of staff at the critical delivery end. So why do we have accountability models that are so oppressive?\nAccountability would have less impact if it were not for the existence of ‘Data’. Data has ruined Public Service delivery. It has created an environment where people who deliver the core business are subservient to process and people who collect data, apply standards that require monitoring and inspection and who undertake quality assurance for the benefit of senior management.\nIt is at this point that an almost Marxian‘ contradiction’ can be seen. The most important people in an organisation who deliver core business become less important in attracting resources, sometimes because they fail to hit targets due to a lack of relevant staff. The measurers, weighers, trainers, and middle and senior managers take precedence, as they protect and justify the organisation’s performance.\nFront-line staff become mere cogs in an alienating, data-based, and micromanaged process. This turns professional decision-making into ‘expected standards’ within a generic ‘accountability’ framework. It renders the ‘coal face’ and core business, a stressful and toxic environment from which everyone wants to escape because the demands are too high, the risks are too great and the rewards too little. But then with no public service ethos, what are the reasons to enter the challenging public sector coal face? Put bluntly, promotion and higher salaries, or a move into an ancillary role.\nThe Public Sector’s insatiable demand for public money usually means that money is forthcoming when needed, particularly in high-profile services like Health. However, this extra money all too often gets ploughed into more management oversight and accountability, Quality Assurance, or training. In effect, it does nothing to tackle the problems experienced by coal face practitioners who get more and more stressed whilst other qualified colleagues on the same wage, monitor, evaluate, or criticise their performance with the aim of protecting the organisation.\nThis is the reality for too many front-line public sector workers. Their workplace is stressful, and the core business is poorly resourced, relative to ancillary tasks and management. After the continued prevalence of management expanding to achieve greater organisational control and accountability, there are other major problems with the delivery of public services. This next issue is perhaps the one that has arisen since the Millennials became the aspiring generation.\nThe most significant change in the public sector is the emphasis placed on accelerated promotions based on self-declared competence rather than old-fashioned ‘experience’. This has allowed a younger and more ambitious group of largely inexperienced staff to quickly gain promotion into management including senior management. Competent at ‘intelligence’ and psychometric testing, they enter the public sector for its well-remunerated career structure rather than its core business. Remember management never was a core function.\nIt is not uncommon to hear young people entering public service roles describing an expectation, sometimes born of narcissism, that they will get out of core activity and go into management. The reasons are lower stress levels, and career opportunities elsewhere. This is where they will acquire their career-defining salaries, as opposed to old-fashioned character-defining public service. Beyond the level of core delivery and into senior management salaries and rewards, packages are often more than one hundred thousand pounds per annum whilst some workers who get such salaries are barely experienced and still in their mid-thirties or early forties.\nThis latter point captures the most outrageous ‘contradiction’ in the provision of modern public services, namely the highest salaries are paid to those who take the fewest actual risks. The risk in any public service is at the delivery end, the police officer, nurse, social worker, probation, or housing officer who must manage public expectations whilst exercising authority face to face, which is increasingly becoming the authority to say no to an entitled and expectant public.\nThis difficult and increasingly risky core business does not go on at the level of the senior leaders as they are encouraging us to style them. This is a topsy-turvy world where risk is not rewarded but is actively avoided by promotion away from it, and where remote and meaningless managerial responsibility for the burden of risk carried by others is far too well remunerated. But this is now considered ‘normal’ in the modern Public Sector.\nIt is considered normal because it meets the needs of an ambitious group of career operators who have been encouraged by politicians, employee bodies and the clueless civil service to create the bureaucratic micromanaged public sector as a means of driving an efficiency framework based on accountability but which justifies an ‘elite’ workforce of overpaid managers. The public sector has now removed itself from the core principle of public service which once financed the delivery of services by professionals working directly with and on behalf of the public. It has become a career structure complete with accelerated promotions and plenty of hubris.\nIf this reality was not bad enough, the managerial solutions offered for stress and ‘burnout’ are either the provision of counselling services to build resilience or the patronising Blue Peter-like reward and recognition schemes or ‘shoutouts’ for those who manage to hang on in. Both these miss the point that it is the workplace that is toxic, and it is made worse by the data-driven expectations of over-paid management plus of course the demands of the general public with a growing sense of entitlement..\nIt is this that makes the public sector workplace a toxic environment for too many of those who in diminishing numbers carry the risks of the system. The solution seems to be more data, more scrutiny, more management oversight, and more training. But the public sector’s growing army of little emperors has no clothes.\nSo in summary the public sector’s original post-war values of fairness, equality and service delivery have been replaced by a rapacious free market ethos of unfairness, inequality and elitism, within a newly created management hierarchy that has been created to achieve targets in order to secure funding and in some cases Chief Executives bonuses. No one within this corrosive system apart from the coal-face workers themselves can see anything wrong with this model. The management of this system predictably enough behaves like an exploiting and unaccountable class. When Chairman Mao identified in 1966 that China was developing an elite caste of bureaucratic overseers, remote from the workers he was seeing exactly what we are seeing in the Public Sector today. We don’t need a murderous cultural revolution to deal with it, however just some restructuring and going back to properly funded values of public service and democratically accountable professional public servants.\nSo, how might we achieve this? Well firstly government must not let public sector careerists persuade them that data, accountability, and more management or training is the answer to serious incidents and high-stress levels. It is not, in fact, it is the opposite. We need more qualified and experienced personnel to leave their current ancillary roles or management positions and take their experience back to the coal face. Remove the absurd differentials in salary where workers who carry massive risk do so for little reward, whilst senior managers who carry no personal or professional risk are over rewarded for simply protecting the reputation of the organisation. Rather than a levelling up, what the public sector needs is a levelling down, an increase in coal face workers and a stripping out of strategic management and the costs associated with data collection, needless training and accountability. With massive savings in management costs and the costs of losing big bureaucracy, an enhanced package of pay should be available for those front-line staff who shoulder both risk AND responsibility for the increasingly challenging work in all areas of public service The experiment of the elitist public sector ‘career’ could then be ended, and not before time.",

We are fatter and have chronic conditions such as diabetes. In the past, we would smoke and die prematurely, we would have heart attacks and die prematurely. We would die before we suffered from dementia. Today we are capable of being kept alive long beyond the point at which we are able to maintain ourselves, and we become a burden. We become a burden on someone the issue is on whom should we become that burden.\nMrs May was trying to ensure that on behalf of the taxpayer she got some of the costs of adult social care back by getting homeowners and those with an estate to contribute to their care post-mortem so to speak. The amount one could pass on to relatives was raised to £100,000 but there was no cap so a person in need of expensive care could see all but £100,000 of their estate being gobbled up in care costs. The furore seemed to take her and the Tories by surprise. However, it shouldn’t have done. Like student debt, the policy is intended to relieve the state of a financial burden but in passing the cost on to the person in need, it becomes a case of letting the state off the hook whilst over one generation removing an element of financial support for the next generation, which in turn burdens the taxpayer at a later date. A cap on the amount the state would expect the individual to pay quickly followed.\nThe reason we are concerned about this whole situation is that it reveals how the state is enthusiastic to withdraw funding and therefore responsibility for social support, (as it has done with higher education another related issue here too) a responsibility that it has taken on relentlessly since the end of the war. It has altered Britain, changed the nature of the family and now finds itself unable to discharge its responsibilities. As the state withdraws so it is the poorer end of society that suffers. Without the capping, and perhaps even with the cap, within one generation, there will be fewer elderly people wealthy enough to make a contribution as their inheritance would have been spent on their parent’s social care. We thus create a pauper class over time. This is intolerable but would be understandable if the state itself didn’t squander millions on maintaining its own antiquated structures.\nBefore the state pulls out of paying for essential services it should look at how it can reconfigure itself so it uses modern technology to eradicate ‘top salaries’ and develops alternative ways of delivering essential services at a reduced cost to the taxpayer. Our programme is the only programme, contained within our manifesto, that offers this approach as opposed to the approach of other parties which is simply to tax more or pass on costs to those in most need but who are least able to pay as the poorest get it free anyway.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-14-02-17-to-24-05-17/content_81.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 14.02.17 to 24.05.17\nBlue Revolution Archive Page 1\n14.02.17 Riots in British Jails and a crisis in criminal justice. The cause might be the madness of the Blair years and the focus on “self-esteem” and judicial process.\nTo solve the crisis in prisons we need a root and branch reform of the system, and that means clearing out the remote and frankly baffled politicians and tame the money grubbing lawyers who shame the system. It will never be properly “humane” and protect the people who pay for the system (us!) unless this lot have been cleared out or at least severely re-configured. However, who might actually be to Blame? unlike our usual perspective on such matters (ok we are lying!), we blame Blair. Here’s why!\nTony “things can only get better” Blair managed to achieve a landslide victory in 1997 by basically exaggerating the capacity of the state to deliver “social justice”. This was something that the by then hated “Tories” under John Major, had increasingly recognised as undeliverable. Something it pretty much still is!\nBlair’s David Ikeesque “third way” was delivered at both a social level, for example, ramping up expenditure on social work interventions to “tackle the causes of poverty” and raise the “self-esteem” of the poor through a pointless “gifted and talented programme” and cash handouts for booze, sorry for tertiary education. The hip and right on New Labour government also encouraged “relationships” between economically inactive teenagers and the system still does. In addition, poverty was not identified as due to poor decision making and thus placed at an individual’s door but blamed on all sorts of things which were on the whole largely “lifestyle choices” for the reckless or just plain stupid.\nAt a structural level, the new Blair establishment extended the power of the courts in the form of the human rights lobby and created a politicised legal system, based on a strict legal process which is always costly when a QC costs £600 per hour!!However within its criminal Courts there was no reform, the old sanction of imprisonment for all “serious” offences still held sway as the deterrence of last resort. Of course, the lawyers were at the vanguard of the humanising of this 18th-century system as Human Rights Act litigation was Blair’s way of improving things rather than changing things in any meaningful way. Work for Mrs Blair?\nThis was naivety in extremis. On the one hand blaming the “system” for poverty, crime and unemployment whilst making prison the States’ (or rather taxpayers) preferred sanction of choice for the incorrigible and irredeemable offender. This is such a breathtakingly stupid combination that this “Blair” generation of offender’s “self-esteem” overflowing as they strut about smashing up prisons assaulting staff and demanding their “human rights” see no need to reform, none of it is their fault.\nThis sorry mess is overseen by an army of lawyers who are only too happy to oblige with litigation because it is all at the expense of everyone except the “litigant” or of course the “state” that ushered this system into being (remember that the State and the people are not the same thing…yet!!). The solution is not as Liz “rabbit in headlights” Truss suggests, more of the same! But we have offered a solution before and we will offer it again!\nFirstly, we need to move away from the toxicity of current welfare and put an end to the mythology put about by the virtuous left that being poor can somehow be blamed on the state. The state on behalf of the people can help by encouraging responsible parenting (for example making parents responsible for their offspring beyond the age of 18) as well as discouraging, by financial and social means, the workless and feckless underclass from having children they can’t support. This is not social engineering which is soul destroying it is life-affirming, particularly for the children of people who properly contract together to have children and don’t see the responsibility for paying for them coming from the taxpayer via the state.\nThe me, me, me-ism of the modern parent must stop. The creation of an entitled “Blairite” underclass, from the remnants of the second generation and now all too often work-less, industrial working class, has to stop. These are the rioting “toddlers” of the criminal justice system, or the single mums struggling to cope with their child men either in prison or if at home, pestering them for sex and a male identity. These “Blairs-men” are the cause of so much crime and unhappiness.\nSecondly, the criminal justice system needs to come to terms with the fact that it no longer represents the interests of the Crown or the Capitalist system. Neither really exist in any meaningful form, hence the Corbynista’s demand for the abolition of both betrays both a breath-taking arrogance and total ignorance of what constitutes the modern economy. The modern economy is debt and consumption dependent and the people who drive the economy and pay the wages of the state’s workers are ordinary people with their debt-based spending and tax payments. So, if you agree that this is the case and the offender’s punishments are both paid for by the people and they the offenders, are on the whole “of the people” (few capitalists or aristo’s in prison) what sort of Criminal justice system would the “people” want?\nWell to answer this one must avoid asking the “industrialists” of the criminal justice system namely the top managers, contractors, Judges and lawyers and ask the people. With little prompting, most people want effective deterrence and punishment with the accent on “prevention of further offending and harm”.\nPrevention of further offending in a system which is gamed to encourage further offending is almost impossible. Parents suffer as their wayward children veer off course and into a system which warehouses them often only briefly before spitting them back out again. Prison is such a weak deterrence it becomes a home from home, less harsh than a spell of national Service as some of us know all too well.\nThe answer is to slightly reconfigure the “system” so that the tier of the court is not determined by the alleged seriousness of the offence but by the likely severity of the sentence thus getting away from the “Just Deserts” model enshrined in our still feudal legal system. In our model, the severity of the sentence is determined by the risk of further offending (custody for those “dangerous or incorrigible offenders) but punishment can be carried out in the community by way of modern technology for those unlikely to re-offend, and that is very many.\nHow many people would not view house arrest, tracking, tagging, removal of driving licence, passport, exclusion from places and fines as punishment? Also, the reason we don’t pay for our own punishment today is that the “system” was set up when the system represented the interests of the rich, and the system’s “customers” were poor and wretched and destitute and therefore had no money or assets. That has all changed and now we could expect Rolf Harris or Jeffrey Archer to pay a considerable sum (short of making them destitute) for the punishment they receive. The state, on the taxpayer’s behalf, could put a charge on their house!\nNow the obstacles to this system are systemic and in our opinion, the issue of public perception which is used to maintain the status quo (basically the Daily Mail stirring up the “mob” (on behalf of the establishment) into a vengeful fury) needs to be called to order. The systemic problem is a legal buy-in. Within this more cost-effective system, the vast majority of wrongdoers will be effectively punished in the community and could be dealt with in the lower courts with any “breach” of their punishment sent to the higher court for lengthy custody. Wrongdoers at every level will know they are being punished and it will hurt to a greater or lesser extent. This will leave the system able to deal with the army of “Blairs-men” who fight, riot and like Blair argue, blame and incite rebellion and for whom reform, rehabilitation and resettlement are probably not possible….the damage was done almost at birth.\nSo, who will object to these proposals? Well judges might find that too many “serious” offenders are sentenced by lower courts, Barristers will have less work in higher courts, people in the form of the Daily Mail will be horrified if “serious” offenders plead guilty in lower courts because they are able to be sentenced and to maintain a home or job, albeit under very strict and restrictive conditions. Politicians scared to lead the debate will cow tow to the Feudal lobby of lawyers and maintain the status quo. And of course, any closure of prisons will have the unions up in arms demanding a regular but manageable through-put of offenders who can be warehoused and who’s life they can effectively destroy. Oh but all this is not paid for by any of them ….it’s paid for by us!\n18.02.17 There is no stopping the elite from advancing the cause of Remain. The reason is jobs for themselves not the global values they pretend are under threat from Brexit.\nIt doesn’t matter whether it is Blair or his elite Blairs-men (as opposed to welfare dependent Blairs-men) such as Osborn, Clegg or Cameron. They are all completely incapable of gaining the kind of insight that the thinking, as opposed to feeling, Brexiteers have about the decision the country made last year to leave the EU. The reason is quite simple. The EU and its agencies and outposts of empire provide jobs for the kind of people the Blair’s and other elites hobnob with on a regular basis. There are thousands of well-remunerated jobs in a whole range of impressive but often largely irrelevant departments in the EU. These allow this self-defined and self-perpetuating elite to enjoy a good lifestyle at the public’s expense. It is really ****** outrageous! Pardon our French.\nHowever, the belief that the elite are needed to govern us is the bitter irony at the heart of the whole EU fiasco. They are the last people who should govern. They really think that we ordinary people are too stupid, greedy and selfish to manage the economy and play our part in society without having them to guide us and steer us towards their definition of a new Jerusalem. However, if we look at the facts of the case, we see that a revolution is required and that the people who are abusive are not “the people” but the elite. Without getting too boring about it let us just consider two examples.\nHow many people are exploited by the local plumber, baker, electrician, factory worker, or the person who works in a supermarket? We would hazard none. How many people are exploited by a Customs Union which locks the EU out of trade deals with countries that are crying out to share wealth and values which are shamefully locked into the EU with its cosy gravy train? We would argue millions and too many young males, with no work at home, migrate to the EU where the money is, and with cultural incompatibilities ever present become something of a hazard. So, we have an EU elite patronising Europe’s workers ignoring the concerns of the working class and whilst barely able to articulate that the problem of migration is one of trade policy, their trade policy, confining numerous countries to starvation and poverty. Britain with Brexit will strive to correct this.\nThe second example of how the elite should go away and engage is some serious soul searching relates to our old friend “Tone”. “Tone” goes to appalling regimes all over the world talking about we suspect anodyne globalised waffle and gets paid thousands of pounds. Now there lies the problem for the world’s exploited working people. All the countries he visits will be exploiting or abusing workers, many are feudal or tribal systems where human rights are essentially conferred by rank as was the case in the UK six hundred years ago. So here we have “progressive” Blair and his ilk taking money that has been exploitatively appropriated from oppressed people by a foreign elite who are still operating a social system based on coercion, power and control. Blair should be asked: “who has been exploited so you can have so much money?” The truthful answer should be “just about everyone!”\nShould we trust our own elite…..you must be ******* joking! Pardon our French!\n18.02.17 Mrs May is sorting out Domestic Abuse and we applaud that, but the issue of the damaged co-dependent couple risks turning the problem into another “industry” for the state.\nDomestic abuse is horrendous and a throwback to primitive relationships based on power and control. In the 21st century, the power doesn’t always rest with the male, as we rightly promote and expect equality between the genders thus women are quite capable of exercising wholly unacceptable power over males. Domestic abuse does, however, affect more women than men\nIn our usual way, we will take a slightly oblique view of the problem. For us, the problem has its origins social expectations, and these have changed over the last sixty years.\nIn the past males and females had roles prescribed for them by a society which only recognised the reproductive role ascribed by a person’s gender. Wider economic considerations for women were largely ignored. Marriage was about sex and reproduction. Marriage was based on “social expectations” and perhaps even “lust”. This resulted in too many people feeling pressured into marriage. Once married, a form of social entrapment ensured too many lives were blighted by misery and unhappiness. The Divorce Act’s slowly made liberation from these sad arrangements possible. All well and good.\nBy the 1980’s marriage became a contract that was not really worth the paper it was written on. We refer to marriage as an “illiterate’s contract” as it was made verbally, usually in church, and was upheld by society rather than enforced in law. It lacked the proper terms a real contract would contain just vague promises.\nfrom the 1980’s onwards marriages came and went, and families reconstituted and often reconstituted again. The basis for the abuse within the marriage shifted from frustration caused by a feeling of entrapment to a feeling that marriage was being undermined and social expectations were being toyed with. Men in particular, felt divorce marginalised them as women became more liberated.\nWithin the marriage “industry” this is pretty much how it goes today. A big ceremony then expensive divorce. Marriage is a wholly inadequate “contract” upon which to base decisions about bearing, raising and safely nurturing children. The law says adults should put the children first but marriage breakdown and immature behaviour by parents suggest that this is just not happening in all too many cases.\nHaving said that Marriage based partnerships are not where the domestic abuse is most prevalent today partly because there are more cost and formalities involved in getting married and a “stigma” about “bad divorce”. Also, many people have voted with their feet and save themselves the grief and tensions of divorce by not getting married in the first place.\nModern domestic abuse (DA) still happens in marriage but it has spread into numerous other relationships. The single mum on welfare with her boyfriend is the most vulnerable of the new victims of domestic abuse. Their vulnerability a result of the psychological weakness within families occurring over the last 30 years and rendering many family’s incapable of bringing up grounded children, mature and self-confident enough to become the next generation of parents. This is particularly problematic for boys who with access to pornography are having their expectations of girls defined by sex, whilst too many girls encouraged by welfare, define themselves not by their economic capability but by their reproductive capacity.\nUnlike the 1950’s the non-marriage family today often lacks the father of the child. The state has taken this father role away from too many men, having created the single, unemployable and too often criminal young male (Blairs-men as we call them) who fathers and then walks away from responsibility. However, he often doesn’t go away for long; he is usually back the next time he wants sex and exercises a proprietorial control over the mother of his children. Some women to avoid this territorial behaviour or because they are simply “a shag” will have children by multiple fathers. The mutual insecurity triggers abuse and too often violence. These women, as well as the mothers of these child-men, are the most common victims of modern domestic abuse.\nTo the politician’s the answer will be of course be a lot more prison for DA offenders and more agencies working together to protect victims. The problem is that the males and females locked into these dysfunctional relationships can’t really escape them. The women are trapped by motherhood both in terms of having the father(s) of her child/children to deal with as well as abuse from their lost angry Blairs-men sons. The reality is that these sad and co-dependent people have none of the psychological strength to leave flawed relationships and this confines them to a life of misery and the taxpayer to a lot of expense.\nThe Blue Revolution solution is to get real about the causes of the problem, welfare and family breakdown, and to ensure that marriage stops being an illiterates contract and becomes a properly entered into a contract which spells out marital and parental obligations before children are born or at least very shortly after their birth. This applies to all parents and DNA will prove parenthood if necessary, to ensure responsibility isn’t shirked. In this sense, the romance might suffer but everyone involved should have a better idea what is involved when you create a legal contract and bring children into the world.\nNo one is forced to have children and too many people who do should not. The answer is to recognise choice and consent in the decision to have children (stop infantilising working class girls by assuming they lack the capacity to make an informed choice about pregnancy) and then make the decision to have children a legal contract between the parents, wider family and where necessary and only where necessary the state. This should increase responsible behaviour, make people and families accountable for their children and grandchildren and get the state largely out of a system where it simply “games” in favour of the least capable parents.\n20.02.17 People don’t understand economic determinism. However, it explains not only why “progressive” social change takes place but also why things don’t happen. V2\nEconomic determinism, little referred to and little understood. In simple terms, it is the process by which an economy creates economic value (in western culture that means how it makes money) and how this affects the social arrangements. Thus, the economy affects issues like people’s rights and freedoms and to what extent they are determined by gender, rank or class.\nIf you read some of our earlier post’s they go into more detail however it is enough to say that the means of economic production sets the template for social arrangements and individual rights. What can or cannot be done socially is determined by what freedoms the means of production or the real economy allows.\nCapitalism freed people from tribal and feudal bondage. The capitalist means of creating wealth conferred rights on people, rights such as contract, choice and consent upon which is constructed freedom and democracy.\nThe rights capitalism conferred were limited at first, as only the rich could enjoy them but eventually, these rights have been conferred on everyone. Whilst few will identify it as a legacy of Capitalism gender equality and the equality of sexualities is down to capitalism.\nCampaigning has been important as no one would have allowed “gay marriage” or gender realignment without an active campaign demanding these rights but the social and economic context was permission giving, rather than hostile or even hateful. The question for us all is why?\nSorry but there is too much red wine in this post. Sack the political economist as we want to hear from our tame politician about Stoke and Copeland.\n25.02.17 Stoke and Copeland…..lessons for Labour, but the death rattle for Ukip.\nStoke and Copeland were fascinating results and we could and really should have tried to predict the result so predictable it turned out to be. The lessons from these results fall into three.\n1) UKIP are finished as a political force and the working people who voted for them will start to drift away from them in future elections. As their votes are now “mobile” there is everything to play for.\n2) The Conservatives can and are picking up working people’s votes and Theresa May is very persuasive as a kind of people’s champion. Hence, they won Copeland. The Theresa effect could, in theory, continue for a long time to come, not just because of the state of the other parties but because she seems to be offering a kind of Blue Revolution lite. Theresa May is navigating the choppy waters of 21st-century politics and economics with more skill than the opposition.\n3) The intervention by David Miliband completely misses the point. Yes, Labour is a mess, but let us at a Blue Revolution offer them some objective analysis rather than Miliband’s “if you had voted for me as leader none of this would have happened” political narcissism. Labour’s two factions are in deep trouble. The Blairites first. The main problem for the Blairites is that the brand is toxic, associated with illegal war and a culture of selfish indifference to the concerns of real people coupled with a grotesque obsession with getting rich, hence their love of Remain and the EU. Thus, the simpering, well-intentioned but essentially careerist Blairites are about as appealing to the general voter as an evening hearing about a neighbour’s recent holiday. The party workers or activists don’t like anything about Blairism and are prepared to dump the whole sorry “third way” mumbo jumbo and move back a decade or five. And that is their problem.\nThe general voter understands that politics has moved on in the 21st century and they understand that a party which is reconfiguring itself to appeal to a no longer in existence industrial working class is slowly going to disappear. Whether it is being politically savvy or just the right person at the right time this explains Theresa Mays success. She appeals to the modern working class…..namely everyone except the overpaid and the political elite. The Labour party can still count on support from some but by no means all members of the “industrialised” public and pseudo public sector, like lawyers, but as activists go that is about it.\nThe Labour party under Corbyn also has the approval of the now unemployed second generation ex-industrial workers who account for much of disrespectfully described underclass. However, whilst this is a growing constituency the reality is that they are inactive politically and tend not to vote.\nSo, to the Labour Party, we say, stop blaming Corbyn. The only people who give a damn about the old labour movement support him even though he represents a near non-existent political constituency. Perversely it is the Conservatives who offer a listening ear to the working class of 21st century Britain not the Europhile Blairites with their sanctimonious and patronising political elitism. To the Blairites, we say “join the Conservatives” (if they will have you) and to the Corbynites, we say “come and join us…if you dare”.\nOh, just one final point if you should ever read this Jez please sack Emily Thornberry….according to our psychologist she represents no one, but herself.\n02.03.17 “Housing Crisis” or simply too much of the wrong provision in the wrong place and it costs too much!\nHousing is in crisis, so we are told. Yet the evidence of an actual “crisis” seems to be missing. If you look at who is housed, then most people who are working are housed and usually housed comfortably. If they want a home, there are homes out there ready for occupation. There are three-quarters of a million empty homes.\nIn the inner cities, landlords buy up homes and make them available for students and migrants. This, primes and sustains the market for new builds on the outskirts of towns. These are purchased by the new middle class of public servants and working couples who can move up and out of the town and city centres. As this market has evolved built on migrant workers and student indebtedness, so house price inflation becomes endemic. In the end house price inflation switches from being social negative to an economic positive becoming a means of driving other markets including the general consumer market via secured borrowing.\nTake away family breakdown, student debt and migrants and the market would go flat and then house prices would begin to fall. This would be good news for buyers and perhaps with a bit of negative equity for the current winners, ordinary working people, even shop workers might be able to afford to buy their own inner city or town centre property. A Blue Revolution would burst the housing bubble and get some sanity back into a market that is gamed by governments, landlords and the financial sector but denies poorer working people the chance to own their own home.\nThe current housing market is not adversely affected by a lack of supply but by high prices and a lack of affordable finance due to wages being too low to pay for the inflated house prices. It is simply not true that there are not enough homes. There are not enough affordable homes but building on green field and destroying the countryside will not solve the problem. It will not make houses more affordable. To solve the problem first understand it and then have the guts to tackle it comprehensively. That may mean improving family resilience, getting student numbers down, closing some academic institutions, and reducing inward migration via welfare reform. All now possible post-Brexit.\nJust like “Remain” itself there are vested interests at work to preserve the housing status quo. Whilst change is often unwelcomed it must not be avoided, we the working class need it if we are not to be further economically marginalised by being squeezed out of yet another market. The state claims to be able to address and fund markets in health, education, social care and housing for the low paid. They can’t and should not pretend they can. The days of state hyperbole needs to stop, and markets need to be made to work for the poor.\n05.03.17 We rip up the planet so some can get super-rich and the rest of us can buy “stuff” but what is the endgame and really what’s the point?\nIt doesn’t matter what problem the planet is facing, there is going to be some link to the behaviour of humans. Humans are the planet’s biggest threat and the biggest threat to harmonious human survival remains humans.\nIf the only way we can as a world “get on together” today, is to rape the planet of resources, we all have a long-term problem we are all currently very keen to ignore.\nWe at a Blue Revolution explore a possible “end game” for this destructive system. A sort of secular-westernism meets various types of mediaeval tribalism at a point when the planet can no longer sustain the current model for resourcing global peace. It does not look pretty but we offer a Blue Revolutionary alternative.\nThe western world is, whether we like it or not, slipping back into a form of market sustained feudalism. There are very rich and very rich people in the west who have got rich either by taking advantage of taxpayers via government spending or who have got rich by working the so-called free market. Basically, they are rich because poorer people have paid out for them to be rich. These rich people have no idea that their wealth is a form of theft or perhaps more pertinently, acquired by a form of deception. We at a Blue Revolution, unlike our Red counterparts, don’t see “the state” as part of the solution. The State is part of the problem.\nWith western billionaires basically acquiring the proceeds of the debt of others as their personal wealth, debt all too often acquired by the masses to purchase unnecessary “stuff”, the plant struggles with a surfeit of demand for resources. After the west add in the rest of the world who exploit their repressed people. The despots of the second and third world raid the earth’s resources for their personal wealth. Thus we have come to a point where the poor old planet is being stripped bare by the masses to meet the needs of rich people who either through political repression (China, Africa and Middle-East) or economic deception (the West) are getting “stinking rich”.\nThe end point for this is an economic and social collapse, perhaps better known as war. Let’s be honest who wants to change how we live our lives in the West to save the planet and our global stability in the long term. Because everyone sees this as a government responsibility and governments don’t want to “upset their regimes” or lose elections the climate conferences come up with nothing except fine words. We are ambivalent about man’s responsibility for climate change but the need to reduce production and consumption would be reflected in a reduction in carbon emissions. The problem is that the rules of economic determinism dictate that if it isn’t going to work economically within the existing growth paradigm, it isn’t going to happen at all. And so, it doesn’t.\nThe reason we should reduce aggregate demand, thus changing the paradigm, is because it is bad for the planet to consume so much and with ballooning middle classes in China and elsewhere, projected consumption is unsustainable. Debt is the way the foolish west tries to keep up with emerging economies, given the West’s relative loss of purchasing power within this growth-based system.\nSo how do you change a paradigm that everyone has, or everyone wants, and no one seems willing to change?\nWell to start with the west needs to lead a Blue Revolution, a revolution based on maintaining high levels of equality as well as lower levels of growth. In the UK we could start by hacking back at the class based public sector, reducing differentials in pay and giving no public servant more pay than the Prime Minister. This establishes the principle that equality is more important than wealth acquisition on very much a personal level. We would also get rid of any structure which simply creates well-paid tax-payer funded jobs such as much of the higher education sector.\nSecondly, we would make the relationship between people and the state “contractual” based on choice and consent. No unconditional anything. There would be obligations and responsibilities as well as the rights enshrined in Contract, Choice and Consent to drive responsible as opposed to childlike behaviour. This would start to reduce idleness and welfare dependence and put families back at the heart of the nation. The left wing will scream that this undermines the rights of the poor, but that is because they don’t understand Marxism.\nFinally, we would look at creating a welfare system based on social value. We would move away from a two thousand-year-old paradigm of wealth only being generated economically, to a system where social capital was valued too, maybe a form of national social service. Taken together these three approaches to economics should start to shift the paradigm into a more sustainable form fit for the future.\n06.03.17 If you are “living the dream” you are probably part of the nightmare!\nJust a quick one as we have covered the themes of wealth being linked to debt-based exploitation, but this sums it up well. Living the dream probably means that someone is either in debt or has been persuaded to part with cash that has its origins in government debt. It also means that the planet is being stressed by too much unnecessary western consumption, just as China and India et al wish to join the “living the dream” hegemony. “I am living the dream” begs the question, who’s dream is it really and is it not simply a long-term debt-based nightmare for someone packaged as your short-term dream.\n07.03.17 “let my daughter work” a mother’s plea on behalf of her disabled daughter. What is the Blue Revolutionary response?\nSomeone popped in and left a copy of “The Spectator” dated 4th March 2017 with us and asked us to consider an article by Rosa Monkton which was about her daughter Domenica who has a disability and the obstacles Domenica faced in the job market. We will carefully consider the issues and be back, however, we will be applying our revolutionary principles so won’t come back with a “third-way fudge”.\nIn primitive hand to mouth societies, the disabled were either stillborn or were taken away and buried alive. The reason is exactly the same reason that windows are abused in primitive societies or in even more primitive societies female infanticide is justified. It is because those groups are groups who contribute less economic and social value than they consume in resources. So in a primitive society, they are denied the right to fulfil their “species-essence” they are denied the right to life. Barbaric and it still goes on!\nIn primitive society, social value is essentially delivered by the female however where it is possible to do so “social value” can by synthesised in the form of the enforced compliance of the rules through brutality (it still goes on now in that ******** Saudi Arabia). So in such societies, you need fewer old women, therefore fewer girls and no people with a disability.\nNow the idiot left will have completely missed the point that Capitalism and Christianity accorded all of these groups a dignity which not only showed them compassion but also the ability to create and sustain social and economic value. A capitalist would pay an exploitation wage based on a person’s productivity. In effect, anyone could be a proletarian if a capitalist could exploit them, including the disabled.\nIn a Christian influenced society which has pushed beyond feudalism, everyone has a social and an economic value. Rose in “Upstairs Downstairs” (cultural reference alert) was a simple girl who washed up. She added social value to the crew downstairs and added, by playing her part in the household, to the economic value of the household overall. The Marxian would not miss the point that much of the household income was based on some form of exploitation or another, but the principle that all have a social and economic role can’t be ignored even by the modern liberal left.\nThe liberal left, however that group is defined, do not recognise the need for people to make any kind of social or economic contribution. They rely on the lazy disabled to be the voice of the disabled and shriek if anyone suggests that people in wheelchairs can actually, and should actually work rather than be “cared for”. The hated Blair tried to tackle this issue but having no base values (unlike a Blue Revolution) caved into the lazy lobby of the disabled left. The Tories are petrified of tackling the issue as the BBC and the Labour party will simply refresh their “nasty party” slogan for them. The Tories could counter it by calling Labour the Stupid party\nIn addition to leveraging the disabled out of work, the left has allowed a lazy army of second and third generation unemployed industrial workers to become not so much a “reserve army of labour”, as a reserve army of socially dependent idlers. This sums up the problem for our mother and daughter. The left likes idleness because it is sort of edgy “post-capitalist” and non-exploitative “caring” if you like. But of course, this is all bollocks. Being excluded and unable to fulfil any kind of species essence is exploitation of the most rank kind.\nThe left’s “system” does not want to see disabled people having to make mature work related choices based on their own assessment of their ability to contribute social or economic value. The secret of the left’s “progressive politics” is that a system paying to keep people idle is as far as they are concerned exploiting the hated capitalist, which of course is about one hundred years out of date. “Managing” the disabled also creates a caring army of state-funded workers so what is not to like if you are a liberal and left wing?\nWell in a world influenced by a Blue Revolution where we have broadly to contribute either social or economic value based on the concepts of contract, choice and consent Domenica should with her mother’s support find a way of choosing a job. This will involve contracting to employment which balances out her ability to create social and economic value with her unique needs. This may involve her choosing to opt out of the minimum wage. We are no longer a hand to mouth tribal economy so her talents can be utilised! It is not only her responsibility to contribute to society it is societies responsibility to ensure it happens wherever it can.\nThank God or thank social progress (Capitalism) for the fact we no longer kill our disabled children but there is no justice in inflicting on them some kind of state-funded living death.\nOh, and we don’t agree that the government should increase the NI contributions of the self-employed. The self-employed are not some kind of bourgeoisie thy are the foot soldiers of the Blue Revolution. Cut the cost of the class-based state by sacking “top people”. The self-employed are the kind of employers who would be happy to negotiate a reasonable wage for Domenica if they were allowed to do so.\n10.03.17 Grammars, why do the teaching profession hate the very idea?\nThe simple answer is we really don’t know, but it doesn’t matter what the teachers think it is clearly an issue that strikes at the heart of the teaching profession; if it didn’t they wouldn’t care. When something strikes at the heart of an ideology or profession it is usually met with hostility and derision. Just like Sir John Major and Blair as a result of Brexit, experiencing the kind of existential crisis inflicted on blue collar workers all over the western world, so teachers seem to be having some kind of existential angst about grammars.\nNow grammar schools are schools and teachers teach in schools, so it is not a full-on existential crisis. We at Blue Revolution could argue that some children with the self-discipline and academic aptitude could be better taught at home remotely in “virtual grammars”; now that is existential for teachers. But that is not being promoted by the UK government. Now we believe the teaching profession has been able to excuse poor results in schools by relying on the poor quality of the students. Grammars will encourage and stream out of comps a mixture of young academic children including those who want to excel and this might highlight just how poor the rest of the children are. Take the academic kids out of the comp and those children that are left will not deliver the results the teachers need to promote their profession. It will be clear teaching is not what drives academic or any other ability it is the stuff the left wing deny has relevance such as stable families, good parenting, love and kindness….only some of it in the armoury of the teaching profession but everything the liberal left has undermined and is now in denial about.\nNow we understand that academic failure is not really due to teachers it is due to society producing kids who lack the aptitude, self-discipline and interest in learning and this is a long-term challenge for the state (no not state. The country and its people. Ed)which we believe only a Blue Revolution can correct. Kids failing to achieve in comps, however, is not a reason to abandon the idea of grammars. Our only observation about selection is that selection must not be based on a quiz or some obscure test of intelligence, it must be based on spelling, and maths with a little bit of modern foreign languages to identify the children who are marginal or where there is over subscription and too many passes.\nTeachers need to get over themselves and support grammars and accept the limits of their involvement with the children they teach. They are not and never have been the cause of poor academic performance. The Government too needs to change tack and stop seeing teachers as the cure for the army of under-performing, fertile, angry and idle young people “welfare” has created over the last twenty years or so.\n12.03.17 There are no utopias unless you are lucky enough for “the system” to create one for you. How does that happen ?\nUtopia. Thomas More’s ideal society which saw simplicity and eschewing wealth as the hallmarks of the good society. In such a world people would avoid wealth and the “utopia” was an internal one. It existed in the heads of the people. This is not the “Utopia” of the world post-socialism…, particularly Blair’s post third-way socialism. Socialism might have been a necessary phase in human evolution but it leaves a legacy of money grubbing utopianism enshrined in organisations like the EU.\nThere are many ways to create Utopia for yourself, it has to involve money of course, but whilst we can look at Blair’s personal Utopia we can look at some Utopias the seeds of which were sown in the period after the landslide win of the New Labour in 1997.\nThe first Utopia we will consider is the lawyers “Utopia” created by the Human Rights Act and which in the hands of oh so clever “human rights” lawyers can transform tax payers cash into personal fortunes whilst little gain is made by society at large. The lawyer’s and Judges talk of “proportionality” and “necessity” unless of course, it relates to money grubbing opportunities for themselves. From squaddies to prison staff from social workers to police officers it is now possible thanks to lawyers to find oneself in the madness of a Kafkaesque legal pantomime. Lawyers can trap you with “ill motivation” but then if you miss something and someone is harmed you can be accused of “denying their human rights”. The lawyers have nailed this with their ruling today that victims of poor police investigations have had their human rights violated, and yet the police officer who gets it wrong the other way and is seen as overzealous is embroiled in litigation by the lawyers too. Lawyers have thanks to Blair created their own utopia. The world for them is one of irresponsible money making, waffle and highfalutin and very lucrative legal nonsense. This shameful lawyers utopia needs to be brought to and end. The public will end the bullying of rank and file public sector staff by a bewigged swaggering cabal of mercenaries. We the British public know what they are up to and we will in time bring their collusion and indifference to real suffering to an end. You have been advised.\nThe second “Utopia” is the one occupied by the liberal elite and the top end of the public sector class system. Marx as we often state referred to species essence. Maslow refined this to “self-actualization”. The Proletarian could not self-actualise playing their small part in the capitalist’s production machine and the petit bourgeoisie had to act in the interests of the Capitalist masters. Not much self-actualising in that.\nHowever today the petit bourgeoisie (unique in that there is no longer a proper bourgeoisie) among whom are the Civil Servants, Chief Executives, heads of quango’s and politicians, can self-actualize by managing the British public or their rank and file staff. Just like painting or self-expression through performance art, these people thrive by organising and engineering our lives in a way which we, the tax paying public, resent.\nWe resent it because it clearly makes them so happy and smug doing it and of course it is without real responsibility (We still carry that, see above). This activity adds little of value to our lives whilst we have to pay them for their pleasure via our taxes or compliance with their “policies”. Until we bring this class to heel and make them act on our behalf they will continue to destroy our lives, society and our economy whilst maintaining their own lucrative little utopia.\n14.03.17 A bit Utopian the last post or so some people think… but only for some. Any other utopians out there and who isn’t living the utopian dream?\nThe last post highlighted two winners of the British publicsectocracy, lawyers and the liberal elite. However, it was pointed out that there must be others so ignoring the elites of the NHS and others we regularly refer to we will consider those at the bottom of the social pile and those in the middle. Firstly we don’t want to penalise the poor or those on benefits. The problem they face shouldn’t be financial they are moral. The utopia the elites have created for the unemployed, “out of workers” is corrosive to the aspirations of the whole country. Welfare in the form of benefits within the existing framework be they generous final salary government pensions or unemployment benefits are good for no one.\nIn the case of the former group the pensioners, they have a lifestyle which has benefitted from the gentle inflation of the economy and the expansion of the public sector which occurred after the second world war. They are able to travel abroad, have retired early and had a lifestyle unencumbered by in many cases any kind of multi-generational caring as this has been “industrialised” by the state. They have benefits too all paid for by the British struggling to keep the state afloat “working classes”. The state needs to look after this group as they vote….unlike our next “utopians” the idle second and third generation ex-industrial and agricultural workers. This group it is fair to say have been created by mighty global forces which have either given their work to the Chinese or in the case of the others their jobs have been done more flexibly by an army of migrants on zero hour contracts.\nThese changes have led this benighted group to find comfort in the only activity the state is prepared to celebrate unquestioningly with tax payers cash…having babies (and all that is pleasurable about the process of making them). The state likes “industrialising” things and childcare outside of committed relationships has grown to support an army of state employees too many of whom operate at the level of our “public sector elite”.\nSo who are the losers of the system, and what about the Sir Philip Greens of this world. Well, Sir Phil does not create his own “utopia” unlike the others above he can, and his type often do, crash and burn. For the moment the others above have a system which keeps their positions fairly guaranteed and each depends upon the other groups to maintain their position. The single parents need the state and the state needs to keep an army of workers to protect them and lawyers to uphold their human, welfare and reproductive rights. The pensioners too need the state and state need them as they vote.\nSo who is left, who are the people looking in on this feudal liike system of state remunerated utopians? From political or legal overlord to unemployed single parent the requirement to work for average wages is all to often avoided by status or illness. So the people who service this utopia are the ordinary workers and taxpayers those who can’t or morally won’t avoid work and have to do it for a modest return.\nThe nonutopian’s are therefore the self-employed the low waged and the public sector “tactical” or “operational” staff. These are the people who seem to end up in court for some trumped up “human rights” infringement. Of all the non-utopians the ones we feel the most sympathy for are the tactical public sector staff. They have to deal with the utopians, including the lawyers and their “letters before claim” and their basically spurious legal cases. They have to be insulted and abused by self-centred management who glide around public sector HQ’s on 100+k salaries taking no responsibility for anything but demanding KPI’s are hit or there will be cuts. And more importantly, they have to deal with Britain’s appalling, entitled and strangely angry general public, oh and their kids.\nTo the police officers, nurses, teachers, social workers, traffic wardens, jobcentre staff, soldiers etc as well as the shop and factory workers and the self-employed we salute you. If anyone has to be “given a break” it is you. The state needs massive cost cutting so it needs to come from the places where there is the most “fat”. It needs to come from the utopians. Challenging the utopians is not a threat to liberal democracy…….it is an expression of liberal democracy.\n16.03.17 OMG Post truth Campbell tries to stir up anxiety and counter revolution over Bexit. W\nAlastair Campbell that supporter of the dodgy dossier and the war in Iraq….all pre, post-truth “post-truth”? has now decided to support the venerable Lord Heseltine on the subject of Remain. As you would expect it is all gloom and doom, young graduates fearful for their future, delusional proles lied to by post-truth Tory scum and “kippers” all a scheming and a manipulating and it will all of course end in disaster. We agree it will all end in disaster, a disaster for the ranks of the EU superannuated Remainers and their kith and kin. The so-called “Brextreamists” among us should be proud.\nThe Brextreamists have had the foresight and the vision to recognise that the EU was simply a gravy train for Tone, Campbell, Heseltine and ranks of other elites from all sides of the political spectrum hobnobbing with elites from all over the globe and their kith and kin. We don’t want to “bang on about Europe” but whilst there may be some “adjustment” as we leave the soporific EU and once again become a fully grown up member of the world community assisting the world with our global trade links, the world community will gain productively, democratically and economically from Brexit.\nAll this positivity rather than like the EU elites, taking full economic advantage of the fellow elites of the oil, mineral and gem rich feudal states of the African continent and Middle-East whilst between them casting the poor of the African, Middle East and Asian continents into poverty and starvation by refusing to trade properly with them.\nCampbell and his ilk need to be put into the dustbin of history. Bring on the revolution!\n19.03.07 When a Judge is roundly attacked for commenting critically on drunk young women we ask: what drives third wave feminism?\nFirst wave feminists demanded rights, second-wave feminists demanded equality, and third wave feminists demand whatever they damn well like, and they expect to get it too! So, what drives feminism?\nFrom an economic determinist position, it seems fairly clear to us that few have bothered to look critically at feminism and what drives the modern feminist agenda. This is probably for good reason, as one often comes out on the wrong side of the argument, particularly when the discussions are held online. Many people that dare speak out often endure abuse and allegations of misogyny, even when the protagonist is a woman!\nWe explain the correlation between the progress of the economy and decline of social values by examining what has driven the march of feminism over the last three hundred years. In the period before capitalism, the state would have had no acceptance of women demanding rights of any sort – the hierarchy of the church and state meant that men, as well as women, had limited scope to exercise freedom and choice. During this period, contract and consent began to influence economic behaviour and social activities. Once the concepts of contract choice and consent had entered the economic world these principles were soon demanded by a growing number of excluded members of society – so that they too may benefit from these three then radical but linked principles – principles upon which the bourgeoisie ran the economy and set its social principles.\nOnce contract, choice and consent were out of the economic bag so to speak, it would have been naive not to have expected demand for their extension to other economic groups. It thus began with the early 19th century Reform Acts which conferred the right for working men to vote. It was also fairly obvious that with working men getting the vote, middle and upper middle-class women would demand it too. The Pankhurst family and the Suffragettes were the trailblazers for first wave feminism – they were not interested in equality at this point, but they were demanding the same rights as men, and specifically the right to help choose the government so it was a government of consent for women too.\nWith the rise of socialism and the growing discontent of the “capitalist class”, the movement towards “equality” was well under way through “socialism”. Firstly for men – this was the rise of the “them and us” industrial relations of the factory, mine and yard. This phase culminated, after the second world war, with so-called “public ownership” of the means of production; railways, steel works, car manufacturing companies and many other industries. These industries were gradually gobbled up by the state. The whole concept of equality between the workers and the capitalist was then established, as theoretically the workers and the people now owned these industries. However, women were still paid less than men in these industries. The reality was that there continued to be inequality, the boardroom and the shop floor were and to some extent still are, worlds apart.\nBack to feminism. The feminists at this point had to challenge the many inequalities of the factory floor. Women in work during this era had to endure the inequality of pay which saw many skilled women, in many cases, receiving lower pay than an unskilled man. The women of the Dagenham factory in the late 1960’s for example saw the Unions and Bosses essentially “stitch” the female workers up, by increasing male wages by freezing female wages! Second wave feminists had their work cut out -just like their first wave sisters. The male working class were clearly of little help to the second wave sisterhood. In the end, the women won, but not before correcting wage level imbalances between men and women, resulted in the closure of plants. Once women had wage equality it was indisputable that employment equality would naturally follow, leading to women holding positions such as Bishops, airline pilots, surgeons etc, and rightly so.\nSo far so good, but for feminism, it didn’t stop there. From this point evolved an opportunity for a third wave feminism to develop its distinctive character. The birth of third wave feminism seems to have its origins in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s – which for economic determinists coincides with the final collapse of western capitalism – Western capitalism then mutated into the “free market”. Now, the free market is just about as unhinged as anything can get; it is debt based relying on the over inflation of certain markets (property, art and stock markets for example) and is totally unsustainable in the long term for both individual countries and the planet at large.\nHowever, what it has done is turn subject and citizen into “consumer” and this is where the third wave feminist enters the story. The third wave is, like its first and second wave, simply a product of the economic system and the opportunities the system does or doesn’t create. The third wave thus reflects the “free markets” desire to commodify everything for consumption including men, women and sex. The basis for the “free market” is not what you can produce (social or economic value) but what you can consume. Thus a scantily clad drunk young woman is exercising her right in the free market to consume as she likes and to maximise her power of consumption perhaps by attracting an equally drunk mate?\nIt also reflects the fact that women – particularly young attractive women have become self-objectifying “products” available to be consumed. However, this process is turned into “girl power” by the theologians of the third wave, unless of course, the consumer is unwelcome. In this situation it becomes sinister. But this is a bit like a trades person saying “why have you asked me to fix your car…I might call myself a mechanic, look like a mechanic, talk like a mechanic but in your case, I am not a mechanic. It might be better if one didn’t offer the services of a mechanic in the first place!\nIn any other phase of history, the lack of good public behaviour would be an issue of public concern (as it still is for male drunkenness) but as the Judge found in a recent widely publicised case, when it comes to a third wave feminist commenting on a “sister” maximising her opportunities to consume by whatever means at her disposal, no one, not even a retiring female judge is allowed to disagree with this behaviour!\nThe problem for the Judge here is that she can really only criticise or be seen to criticise. A grounded set of principles like Blue Revolution’s Contract, Choice and Consent would clearly highlight the recklessness associated with public drunkenness. When drunk you can’t choose, or consent, and indeed contracting is out of the question…by law in fact. So, when a drunk of whatever gender gets themselves into serious trouble it should be seen as a failure of due diligence on their part. The community, the police, and the courts are forced to pick up the pieces of this reckless type of behaviour. These processes don’t come cheap for the taxpayer either! It is our view that people of whatever gender when criticised for being drunk in public should not be defended. The whole issue is about mature responsible behaviour, not feminism.\n06.04.17 Why Ken Livingstone represents the danger at the heart of the British left wing\nSome years ago we commented on the danger of the new resurgent British left wing as it grew in strength under the leadership of the “useful idiot” Jeremy Corbyn. When we say “left” we don’t mean the Blairites who are, like Blair himself, just sanctimonious Tories, we mean the ragtag and bobtail collection of people who support “minority causes” with violent enthusiasm. Many of these minority causes from race to class would clash if anyone was interested in opening the whole sorry mess up to some kind of scrutiny. However, the left fall silent and the centre right like the teacher with a kipper stapled under their chair really does not understand where the smell is coming from. Let us help!\nWe warned that the Jewish community, women and the whole identity lobby were not safe within Labour. Ken Livingstone provides us with the perfect opportunity to explain why and also why any liberally minded hard left campaigner should support the Blue Revolution. Ken as we will recall suggested that Hitler was a Zionist because Hitler wanted the State of Israel. This is on the face of it a banal observation, lazy and ill-informed, but it speaks to a constituency of the hard left who would gain strength from this assertion, particularly those with Palestinian sympathies.\nHowever what is wrong with Ken’s comment is that it betrays his total failure to understand the concepts of choice and consent in western culture. Like Hitler, Ken and much of the hard left does not recognise the rights of individuals to Contract, Choose and Consent. Go to any “hard left” rally and you will hear the language of force, control and coercion, just like Hitler would have used to get Jewish citizens into his “State of Israel” as described by Ken.\nThe left wing behaves as though capitalism had never bestowed vital liberal rights on to people before its predictable collapse into the unpredictable and ridiculously unsustainable “free market”. So what we have with the hard left is an enthusiasm for ignoring the liberal benefits of capitalism as they adopt an almost feudal authoritarianism over individuals.\nWith people like Ken and his collection of useful idiots like Jez, women, gays, Jewish people, in fact, all of us should worry about our rights, including human rights under a hard left government….because without a respect for Contract, Choice and Consent they really don’t understand “rights” at all, and like Ken they don’t seem to want to.\n21.May 17 The Saudi paradox and the west’s dilemma V2\nSaudi Arabia is a paradox. A wholly 21st-century country which practices a form of orthodox Islam that would not be out of place in the 10th century. The differences between then and now are obviously technological as opposed to theological. Rights are limited, women have few at all to speak of. Cruel and humiliating death is meted out for a range of crimes most westerners practice on a regular basis. So what do we make of the west’s dalliance with the Saudis’ and how should it play out over time?\nWell firstly understand the nature of the Saudi culture and why it is so repressive. It is what we have called ‘dustbowl Islam’ a strict form of Islam which in earlier times was necessary to keep society safe and coherent. However, this form of Islam is repressive and without the ability to fund its museum piece culture from oil revenues, Saudi culture would have been forced to reform. Nowhere on the planet has Islam become so conservative and even Iran knows that evolution is necessary for survival. So the first point about Saudi is that oil reserves preserve an antiquated culture that without oil would be extinct.\nThe second thing to understand about Saudi and all oppressive cultures is that they have generally not gone through a process of industrial revolution. Industrialisation needs to be based on contract, choice and consent or it doesn’t work and this is all upheld by the rule of civil law. Saudi does not recognise the universal right to contract, choice and consent like many oppressive regimes your gender, rank and title determines your rights or your oppression. This is what makes them different to us and makes them uphold their culture aggressively using their oil money. They don’t understand the concept of universal rights for women, the gay community etc people for whom the rights demanded by capitalism have been extended over the last two hundred years. It would be a good idea for the west to at least acknowledge that their ally is culturally centuries behind being liberal in any modern post-capitalist sense.\nFinally, once we can understand the origins and accept the limits of Saudi culture we should consider the double helix of Saudi cooperation in tackling extremism. A ruling elite who are essentially ripping off the people with the connivance of the infidel and indulging in non-Islamic behaviour be that playboy behaviour in London or contracting for arms with the west are not in the true sense of the term orthodox Muslim, regardless of how many mosques they build in the west. So the culture the Saudi regime upholds on a social level they also undermine on a political and economic level. They help the west defeat ISIS but inspire ISIS too. The west will continue to sell the Saudi Arabians arms and will ignore human rights abuses but should publicly in the west at least be clear exactly why Saudi is as it is, and why, because of that we have to tolerate their illiberal behaviour. This is necessary because when the oil runs out the Saudi regime collapses the only thing left to export will be the culture and it won’t be sold to us it may well be inflicted on us if you get our meaning. Better to start to question it now rather than be seen to endorse it.\nWe are also posting on ABlueRevolution.org\n24.05.17 In the wake of the Manchester tragedy the issue of “Islam” re surfaces again. How should we proceed?\nIslam is a faith which has not been through a reformation as we are told on a regular basis. The suggestion is that when this happens it will be cleansed of all it’s more abhorrent characteristics such as prejudice against non-believers and discrimination against women and gays etc. However, this reformation is unlikely to happen on a scale that reflects the task needed. The reason for this is simple industrialisation has been and gone. The Christian reformation was a movement which demanded that individuals could progress economically with God’s blessing rather than sitting around at whatever position in the feudal or catholic hierarchy they were placed. The process was as much economic as it was theological. Eventually, the capitalist juggernaut caught everyone in its slipstream and transformation of society was imposed on everyone. To make capitalism work the law needed to move into managing commercial relationships and so Contract, Choice and Consent became the three legs upon which the system worked, upheld by parliament and the courts.\nNow the Islamic “reformation” will not happen on this scale. The reformation for all faiths and none has been and gone. But reformation will happen within the minds of individuals who are able to make their way in western society and appreciate the positive effects of Contract, Choice and Consent on society at large. Contract, Choice and Consent are the legacy of the reformation and its capitalisation during the industrial revolution. The rights people have today are owed to them, first by capitalism and then by politicians extending them to more and more groups. This goes right up to recent gay marriage legislation and designing your own sexual identity.\nNow it will become commonplace to hear that the perpetrator of an ‘Islamist’ inspired atrocity is ‘troubled’ ‘failed’ or ‘dropped out’. Because these individuals won’t have been caught in the western world’s aftermath of the reformation juggernaut. Culturally they are different. They will firstly not accept Contract Choice and Consent for people in general and will identify themselves as different from those of us who do accept Contract, Choice and Consent as the basis of a free society. These people are going to be with us for a long time. Islamism is a creed practised with the blessing of the West in Sudi Arabia and which was little understood by those prosecuting instability agendas across the Middle East.\nSo we have to brace ourselves for more threats to our safety. However if we understand that Islamism is hostile to rights and in particular the rights for all, women, men, gay people, people of all faiths and none to choose their own lifestyle based on Contract, Choice and Consent at least as a society we can be better equipped to spot those who might be more of a risk from those who are absorbing and accepting some of the rights as laid down hundreds of years ago by our reformation and the birth of capitalism. It should also inform us about how we understand the cultures of the Middle East so we are promoting trade rather than dependency and migration.",

However the elephant in the room which politicians of all sides are unable to discuss, we are able to reveal as we are not politicians we are ordinary people with an unusual perspective, one that moves away from the normal parameters of debate and hopefully generates purposeful if not challenging discussion.\nThe role of doctors, medics and therapists in any advanced industrial or post-industrial society is the same as the “witch doctor” in any primitive society; to get people back to their full productive capacity. The last thing a society needs are people who unnecessarily burden the economy and society. In less sophisticated societies where, shall we say, life is cheap people die quickly. Illness is a burden, personal and social. When illness requires “care” this “care” is essentially unproductive and so is done by the family, unless the person being cared for has an important role to play in society such as a monarch or overlord or if an ordinary person, they can be brought back to productive health quickly. As recently as the early 20th century the treatment of “Cowards” in the trenches of the first world war illustrates this point nicely. Officers “treated” infantry men executed.\nWe are not anthropologists and don’t know what implications the infirm have had on less advanced societies in the historical past. However old people and the infirm do present a challenge to any society’s productive capacity. We are beginning to experience this here in the west.\nAs we have progressed, society in the western world and elsewhere has been able to set aside some of its social and productive value to enable a humane treatment of some of the elderly and ill to occur. This expenditure requires of course a productive class who created the value so it could either by individual choice or government intervention be distributed to a widening group of unproductive people some of whom are old and some of whom have their productive capacity limited by illness.\nThe medic therefore has a relationship to society which is essentially to get rid of whatever is impeding the individual’s full health and their productive capacity be it within a tribe or an empire. The role of doctors, regardless of their pay, is to get people back to their full productive capacity. As doctors their pay should reflect their success at achieving this universal sociological objective. The elderly should have “banked” social and economic value individually or collectively within families or society and draw on it in their declining years.\nThis brings us back to our opening comments about the Health Service. The problem is that the health service in too many instances is no longer capable of getting people back to full health to fulfil their full productive capacity. It has become, as a result of decades of political weakness and intersecting social policies, a service which undermines individual personal and collective responsibility. It has become a service that keeps individuals alive long enough and unproductively enough to acquire life limiting ailments such as obesity, diabetes and depression to name just three.\nToday we are not prepared to see people suffer or doctors under remunerated, but the reality is that the role of doctors is not to do what they are doing now. The health service was never intended to be brought to its knees or the country that finances it bankrupted by a population of unhealthy people who expect the tax payer, in the form of the government, to sustain them in a wholly unproductive and pointless cycle of illness and medical interventions.\nThe elderly now, who were young adults after the last world war, are probably the last generation of whom one could feel confident they as a generation created social and economic value greater than that which they consumed, and therefore deserve decent treatment in old age. But as for the rest of us, from the ‘Boomers’ onwards what social and economic value will we have to call upon in old age and more importantly where will it come from?\n01.12.15 No to advertising Christianity. Yes, to the promotion of wholly commercial Christmas. Plus, allegations the US is corrupting Iranians with sex and vice. What is going on?\nIs it any wonder that when many cultures in the so called second or third world look at the West, they experience a mixture of confusion and revulsion? Two stories illustrate the incomprehensibility of this secular westernism (1) as we call it.\nFirstly, the Christian Churches, in a nominally Christian country; Britain, are banned from showing in cinemas an advert promoting the Lord’s Prayer. Yet at the same time, the commercial activity of selling Christmas as a period of debt and excessive consumption builds to its predictable crescendo on Christmas day. This must seem perverse even in non-Christian countries. The idea that in Iran it would not be possible to recite the Koran in public places is frankly ridiculous. The difference however would be that be that in the west in general, and in Britain in particular, it should be possible to hear the words of all faiths and none; if of course the “powers that be” were not so weak and unprincipled as to promote other faiths at the expense of our own.\nIt is precisely the secular wests squeamishness about its own religious heritage that has led to a decline in religious pluralism here and more significantly abroad. Let us be honest with ourselves, if the Islamists had not been allowed to think that theirs is the only faith delivering social value, and they were made aware that Christianity was capable of achieving the same, as well being capable of creating increasing amounts of economic value too, it would have challenged the view, held by many of the Muslim faithful in North Africa and the Middle East that Christianity in its secular manifestation is a perverse and perverted faith that sanctions vice and immorality.\nThe reason that this belief holds sway is that real moral , modest, simple Christian voices are silenced in the name of “not causing offence”, whilst to the majority of non- Christians the Christian faith is identified with commercial Xmas and all that is perverse about the west; its delinquency, a pitiful undereducated yet promiscuous welfare dependent class, its planed compromising greed. We can add to that list poor health, and the breakdown of the Christian family into a myriad of “arrangements” that put the needs of infantilised adults before the needs of the real infants and children.\nThe final point we wish to make, and our second story is that if we give up promoting the good that Christianity or Christian heritage can do, and, as claimed by the Iranians we take our perverse secular culture of pornography and vice and use it to try and entrap those of other cultures in an attempt to gain “influence” and game international relations, we are really stooping to a very low and frankly embarrassing level of poor moral behaviour.\nOn the one hand we downplay good Christianity and yet we promote vice abroad which becomes identified as bad Christianity. Christians don’t deserve to be silenced or be misunderstood like this, it encourages intolerance of them and arrogance from other faiths, but moreover Christianity becomes identified with secular westernism and that feeds rage, misunderstanding and even war.\nThe Blue Revolution is not intended to be a mass movement, it is simply a vehicle for encouraging a positive change in behaviour and for stimulating discussion and challenging orthodox “groupthink”. We would argue that if we had had less vice and more faith of all varieties Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu etc over the last sixty years, we may very well be having safe and culturally enriching holidays in North Africa and other troubled locations rather than embarking on yet another bombing campaign. We can start to put things right by allowing the Lord’s Prayer to be heard in British cinemas.\n1 Secular westernism is the practice of free market economics within the context of a secular moral vacuum which gives rise to a type of wealth creation which undermines social value and, whilst creating income for those able to manipulate tastes, desires, and wants, creates little if any genuine economic value.\n04.12.15\nA faith to personalize, collectivize, politicize, radicalize or weaponize; what can we realistically expect from the faithful now?\nThe decision of Britain’s Labour leader to oppose bombing ISIS in Syria shows one extreme of the polarised position on action against ISIS; a sort of “let them get on with shooting us” attitude; naïve but well intentioned as is most left wing thinking on most subjects. On the right we have the bombing which is the “we will do what we can” approach, again well intentioned, and whilst not naïve unlikely to deliver the results envisaged. The argument that the end game is being ignored is valid but it is no basis for not bombing the ISIS criminals. It’s clear that in a place like the middle east end games are the stuff of fools; so much meddling and connivance, oil and power brokering to make any solution hard to both identify and deliver. Just look at the history of the place.\nWe have today a shooting incident in the USA; 14 people killed in what seems to be an ISIS “inspired” act of lone wolf terrorism. Just like the incidents in France and the potential of terror cells in Belgium. Britain will have people like this too, ready to act on impulse either when some random act by the west triggers enough anger to justify detonation and death, or simply because the terrorists feel like “todays the day”.\nThis is the basic problem the west must tackle, lone wolves inspired by, but not necessarily part of, the formal weaponry of radical Islam. We have been keen to talk about ISIS as criminals rather than warriors, but the recent incident in France prompts consideration of the wider Islamic community and from that thoughts about communities of “faith” in general.\nBlue Revolution considers that the difficulty the western powers and therefore western people have, is that western culture is too easily characterised as “immoral” and the Muslim faith unlike Christianity is seen as an antidote to this immorality via its Sharia law. Islam is therefore seen as opposing the “problem” of the west. As people will know, Blue Revolution too views western culture as problematic, and proposes awareness of and therefore avoidance of our “Seven Deadly Sins” because there is still much in the west worthy of preservation and “problematic” doesn’t justify wholesale destruction.\nWhat the west needs is reform, and self-regulation and the corrective of government intervention sanctioned by the people plus widespread moral renewal based on Contract, Choice and Consent between peoples and the people and their government.\nSo what point are we trying to make. Well faith in a modern society needs to be personalised. Those of us at Blue Revolution who have faith do not view our faith or any tenets of it, as something to be imposed on others but we do occasionally collectivise with like-minded believers. We believe that faith should be personalized. This is the reason the Christian Church of England is seen as irrelevant by many as it recognises faith is personal and not political.\nBritish Christianity rightly lacks the power to convert based on grievance or conversion from anger. It is a big step from the personalization of faith to the political or politicization of faith. This involves people grouping together and “sharing” their grievances and their similar views, often attempting to gain converts in the name of grievance. In many ways this is the situation with certain Christians in the US in their opposition to planned parenting or their festering of race hatred. However, it also described a huge proportion of people of the Muslim faith. Adopting the dress and morals of what we have described as “dustbowl” Islam is a political act and it feeds a view of the west that sets people apart who live in the west. Finally, having become politicized it is a small step to being radicalized and fermenting hatred and another large step before one is prepared to kill or blowing oneself up or as we call it weaponse oneself. Weaponisation can occur in other faiths too, the murderers who kill those accessing planned parenting services have weaponised themselves; as of course have suicide bombers and the day tripper Jihadi on the London Underground.\nAll people in the west therefore needs to understand this dynamic, people of all faiths and none. It needs to be understood that if an individual, moves through “personalization” to “Politicization” of their faith it is a process that begins to harden views about others. The views of the Klu Klux Klan illustrate this point. Ordinary Muslims and southern US fundamentalist Christians should be encouraged to see their small acts of politicisation as acts which are not about personal belief but perhaps reinforce difference and implicitly encourage radicalization and for some the act of weaponisation. Jeremy Corbyn’s veto of bombing against ISIS but support for the IRA is another example of the move form personal to political to radical opinion, which for some we are sure inspired weaponisation.\nTo counter this process a simple and universal narrative is required and in addition an abandonment of the current “Political Correctness” agenda in respect of faith. Unless, faith is understood as a personal and possibly collective issue rather than a political movement problem will occur. The mistake of the last twenty years has been to overlook Islam’s political dimensions through the naivety of political correctness.\nIt would today, as a result of PC, be seen as unforgivable to ask of a veiled woman “why do you dress like that”…but it is a reasonable question in these radicalised times, and may indeed give rise to a personalised as opposed to politicised answer such as “it is how I practice modesty, or “my husband, or family tell me to”. Having said that many of the radicalised and Weaponised dress like westerners or in fatigues. So dress is rather complex on its own and gives nothing away.\nThe narrative we need is therefore based on the Blue Revolutionary concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent as the universal conditions of social and moral progress. These are the three key elements of a healthy society that whilst it may not be “free” or “democratic” in a western sense, provides a society that allows the 3C’s stands a good chance of evolving safely and productively in the future and creating a just society. Democracy is expensive so not all societies can afford it. However in the absence of democracy we need the 3C’s to make society just. The only thing such a society would need to avoid are the “Blue revolutionary” Seven Deadly Sins as these corrupt and corrode civility and good manners and inflict inequality and discrimination unjustifiably.\n09.12.15 Donald Trump; a secular westerner sort of gets it….but only sort of!\nA brief post on the back of the recent pronouncement by Donald Trump that some Muslims don’t like Americans. In that bit of his analysis we agree with him and would go further and say that some Muslims don’t like the west not Just the American bit of it.\nThe secular west is not a place where people of faith find comfort; as we at Blue Revolution continually point out. Trumps ludicrous reaction to recent events however just goes to show that the mass appeal he is able like all demagogues to articulate, which is essentially ordinary peoples fear and anxiety. Whilst good at picking up the right vibe his limited skills in analysis and inability to scope realistic solutions render him a buffoon on the world stage.\nWhen there is an expectation that he goes beyond articulating fear he camps it up. For the great man Mr. Trump it would not be sufficient to merely identify a problem; he has to steam in with the Pro American saloon bar solution; thus, we had his ban on Muslims entering the US.\nAs Blue Revolution is a platform to stimulate debate sometime by being provocative, we are pleased that the question was asked “why do some Muslims hate the US”. It was also good to hear that political leaders were the ones tasked to find out why this was the case. Left there, a useful debate could have ensued about the combination of emotions ranging from embarrassment to hatred that is stirred up when people of faith encounter the kind of excessive consumption and trivial social relations that characterises the west and upon which western economies depend.\nWe don’t have to detail the litany of divorce, drink, drugs, sex, pornography and general social chaos, which is “denied” by governments who then plaster over the all too obvious social cracks with government money, in an attempt to obscure just how far from civilised the west has drifted.\nThere is a process of healing the world needs and it could start with a debate about these very complex social and economic issues. However in true buffoon mode Trump closed down the sensible debate and shifted things back to the silent status quo…..the middle ground, the don’t ask don’t tell approach to western problems. By managing to get every other Republican candidate to tell him that his opinions are invalid and ridiculous. ….which of course his conclusions are, the debate was quickly closed down. However, his question is very valid, and it takes people brighter than him to address it.\n14.12.15 Corbyn’s New Socialists don’t know their Marx from their elbow!\nThe bourgeois socialists of Britain’s Corbynista Labour Party and its hangers-on are a group of people who share several left-wing obsessions in common but not necessarily all of them at once, and not necessarily at the same time.\nSome show their credentials by supporting Russia, although Russia is behaving a little like the “spokes-country” for globally derided Christendom. A sort of non- secular westernism in the mould of 19th Century Protestantism. Other “left-wing” groups support 20th century secular Pan Arab causes, others Islamism in its various manifestations covering the whole range of Islamism types from the benign collectivised, to the highly dangerous weaponised Islamism of ISIS and their supporters.\nOne of the latest “Kids on the Block” is a bunch who wish to cleanse the Stalin brand; bringing some benign revisionism to the legacy of Uncle Joe. With the usual collection of Trots and Leninists the marketplace for the “Red Revolutionary” is looking a bit overcrowded. We thought we would offer a “Blue” perspective on our “Red” cousins, whilst also looking at some topical subjects. Regular readers will have noticed that we tend to do this; it helps to pin our brand identity on to an issue and over time to build up a patchwork of small insights that hopefully brings a coherence to the many popular agendas that perplex the world and we are about to allege the “left” lacks.\nThere can be no economic or social algorithm uniting the Left consisting as it does of groups who support an odd range of left-wing policies which often are at odds with both logic and common sense? They come from too many different economic, social and cultural backgrounds for there to be much coherence to their thinking.\nKarl Marx spoke about his theories being scientific in character. Clearly not fully developed as science but totally undermined when his scientific socialism is placed in the hands of those of a so-called left-wing bent. We have endured these people for over a century and a half be they Russian revolutionaries, Chinese revolutionaries, Cambridge Grads circa 1940, supporters of Trotsky’s Left Opposition or anyone of a whole bunch of “revolutionaries” including we suppose good old “Woolfie Smith” of the “Tooting Popular Front”…..oh and Corbyn and crew.\nSo, if what unites the Left isn’t Marxism what unites public sector workers, single mums, students, Trades Unionists, autocrats and people with a dubious grasp of economics and international relations as well as misogynists, feminists, the transgendered and those who desire to change “our way of life” by force of arms.\nWe at A Blue Revolution have been thinking about our Red Revolutionary colleagues trying to distil the unifying theory which must be buried away somewhere in their complex and confusing matrix of political likes and dislikes; what motivates them and what do these disparate groups have in common, and we think we have the answer.\nLet’s start with Capitalism; Marx understood Capitalism in the same way he understood Tribalism or Feudalism. These he saw as simply economic evolving phases that humanity went through, at different times and in different places. This is why we at Blue revolution try and avoid being too censorious about what other cultures get up to…….they may, like Somalia, be locked into a warring tribal culture that it is hard to break away from, or some others may choose to retain practices of the past like our old friend Saudi Arabia, stoning women to death for sorcery.\nFor Marx, all aspects of culture including its faith was a way of ensuring society could provide the value necessary to survive. So, hating Capitalism irrationally and not understanding its contribution to humanities evolution is no more logical than liking and promoting tribalism or dust bowl Islamism in the twenty first century. Culture is either socially and economically coherent with the way economic value is produced or it is not. If it is not, then why not!\nCapitalism whilst promoting inequality, elitism and status was morally “coherent”.\nMarx would have struggled to understand the modern manifestation of capitalism in the form of the consumer “free market” and he would have failed to grasp “Secular Westernism”. Secular Westernism is the consumer free market which is based on contract, choice and consent, but it is now devoid of any social morality. For example, welfare creating a class of adult dependents who like capitalists rely on the value created by others, but who live in idleness, ignorance and squalor. The underclass is far from a reserve army of labour as Marx would have understood them.\nThus, in a secular western world sex becomes commoditised, as do parental relationships, religion, marriage and a whole host of human relationships which should be social and psychological in nature but are in effect “commercial”. This is not “Capitalism” (although there is profit to be had) this is “Secular Westernism” and only the Bods at Blue revolution can see that it is hatred of “secular westernism” which unites the disparate collection of people who fall under the banner “left-wing”.\nThe danger is that by misunderstanding the benefits of the economic principles at the heart of any Marxist period of history, of which capitalism and the free market are but the latest manifestations, it is impossible to understand the confused moral character and motivations of the groups that form the allegiances that the left makes with anti-capitalist groups and how coherent the left is or perhaps is not, at maintaining a moral purpose based on freedom, choice and consent. they don’t know their Marx from their elbow.\n17.12.15 Empire and the EU; “history repeats itself the first as tragedy then as farce”.\nAs everyone from Jeremy Corbyn down will be aware the quote above is from Karl Marx. However, it is often a struggle to identify modern situations where the quote has both relevance and accuracy. Our recent experience of the EU and our experience of empire offer an opportunity to re consider the quote within a context that is clearly Marxian in scale.\nBritain’s imperialism was an attempt, and a relatively successful one, to expand the capacity of British culture to create and amass additional economic value. The process was very simple, the British exported their British Christian social values and economic competence and in doing so, enhanced their ability to amass economic value from the colonies by taking advantage of mass labour and cheap resources. It’s called imperialism.\nTo maximise the chances of achieving this goal the British exported, in addition to their religion and language, their evolving use of capital investment as a way of achieving increasing amounts of economic growth. The project lasted about 300 years. It ended when the elite of the people the British had conquered, grew in skill and confidence and using the “system” they had inherited from their colonial masters, felt able and empowered to grow their capitalism independently from the “parent” culture. From a Marxist perspective this was at least in part a success; in many places sweeping away tribalism and creating a proletariat. This is a point about Marxism that Modern “Socialists” don’t seem to get, as they enthusiastically rub shoulders with tribal type leaders and those who would replace one feudal dynasty with another.\nAnyway back to the main point; the issue holding these newly independent ex colonies back was that whilst the “elite” may have had the skills and ability to operate a social and commercial bureaucracy, at the grass roots the populations were not fit for such purpose and the colonial model run by the British which protected and managed all sections of society, soon became a broken system which failed to deliver a well organised mass labour movement creating economic value via willing ‘exploitation’.\nThe whole thing quickly deteriorated into the tragedy of dictatorship. But at least they got some experience as a society based on the economic freedom of labour and a modicum of gender equality that went with it. Unlike the North Africans and Arabs who were simply manipulated then “pumped” for their oil and as a result retained a culture of tribalism or feudal monarchy with little to mitigate it modern awfulness.\nThe British imperial model’s ability to fully deliver an enduring proletariat failed because it was too easy to abuse rather than economically exploit disorganised labour. The workers levels of social and economic competence meant they were powerless to withstand the abuse visited upon them by the psychotic tribal money grubbers who replaced the colonial rulers, many of the worst offenders being educated in Europe to expect status and power but having no time for capitalisms nuanced legally coherent approach. Brute force and ignorance did just as well.\nEuropean colonial powers; particularly the British, should not be too hard on themselves; they left the seeds of capitalism and from that auspicious start, correctly managed the benefits of any additional economic value created would have led to a socially more egalitarian society such as has happened in Britain since the end of the Second World War; ultimately giving rise to the possibility of a mixed economy or socialism as we call it.\nUnfortunately, the seeds of capitalism were killed by the combination of tribalism and feudalism which was latent in those who took over from the European colonials. The bit the British left behind, the civil service, whilst strangling nascent capitalism by draining the economy of economic value give what value there was to the nation’s leaders in the form of personal wealth, and thus provided the perfect feudal bureaucracy allowing the continuation of autocratic political control.\nSo perversely the bureaucrats who are supposed to be funded by the “real economy”(workers, and wealth creators) became the means by which the economy redistributed whatever economic value there is to the elite and poverty and starvation ensued. Hence the tragedy in the above quote.\nIn Marxian terms the Colonial powers took tribal societies, created nascent capitalist economies which, when they left, slipped into feudalism. However, the countries lucky enough (yes, we did say lucky enough) to have had the British colonial experience had some positive legacy to hold on to, and not just a world language and railways.\nSome European empires were simply rape of a weak country by a stronger one. The British Empire was no like this, it was a commercial empire; trading from within, not perfect by any means but offering freedom from tribalism, and severe gender oppression for those who could become “prolatarianised”. Those who by being forced to sell their labour became acquainted with the concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent, gained the basic building blocks of a modern ‘just’ society that has the possibility to re-establish itself, and start to recognise the rights of workers to have a greater share of the economic value they have created. We at Blue Revolution call Contract, Choice and Consent the trinity of any “just society”; without these no society can progress beyond feudalism.\nNow for the EU……or farce …in the above quote.\nFirstly, we must identify a few obvious differences with the Colonial model. The most obvious one is that in the modern west we create very little that could be called “value”. We create wealth. So, the notion that a redistributive model is needed in the sense that workers are being “exploited” doesn’t really apply. (we won’t go into it here, but value and wealth are not the same thing). The wealth we have, is created by government borrowing and spending, the welfare arrangements propping up consumer spending, as well arbitrary asset inflation such as houses and stock leading to consumer borrowing. We also have at the upper end of the wealth continuum the “fat cats” of the bureaucracy, and those who get rich providing consumer goods and services.\nAnother key element of the Blue Revolution is the need for any western society to understand how little value it creates; both social and economic; and be clear about where that little bit of value ends up. In the modern EU the farce is that just like in post-colonial Africa where the bureaucracy propped up a form of feudalism which impeded social progress, so in the EU, the bureaucracy impedes the progress of society beyond a form of state sanctioned bureaucratic debt redistributive socialism.\nThe problem is that with so little social or economic value being created and a population who neither understands or cares about the need to create value, when the bubble of wealth next bursts, we will have an even more dependent, entitled and under motivated population, not empowered or even willing to evolve socially and economically to start the process of value creation all over again. Like the victims of African colonialism, they will fall prone to being oppressed by whoever is able to gain control of the very limited value still available in the economy. That person or group will have to be ruthless but given the likely chaos at the time, that will be easy; look at how easy ISIS have found it. We should not be complacent about this.\nSo at the risk or repeating ourselves, in chaotic situations like another perhaps terminal economic meltdown when as a culture we have become enfeebled having grown used to spending our wealth but not creating any value upon which it is based, the only coherent reaction is to revert to control via legitimate and fanatical management of the population. A coherent method could be found in fascism, some form of oppressive socialism…Ok fascism, or even Islamofascism. Look what happens when there is a terrorist incident, for example Paris, how quickly free societies revert to social control.\nParadoxically therefore the EU, a value guzzling socialist bureaucracy of the first order, which self-promotes an elite and keeps people placid and pliable by manufacturing consumer wealth, as it simultaneously destroys social value through welfare dependence, immigration etc is a risk to us all.\nThe whole EU process is undermining the likelihood of the core western values of contract, choice and consent surviving the next great economic catastrophe. As with Colonial Africa it won’t be the bureaucrats and technocrats that suffer…..it will be the rest of us. Don’t let the current farce turn into another tragedy. You have been warned!\n19.12.15\nIf you don’t know what you really want in life, think about what you might end up with in death; if society can provide it by then of course!\nJust think about it.\n22.12.15 Ntokozo Qwabe and Cecil Rhodes; a partnership forged by Capitalism-regrettably for him!\nNtokozo Qwabe has expressed the view that the statue of the long dead patron of his Oxford scholarship should be removed as Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist and “looted Africa”. At A Blue Revolution we feel this is a topical story having appeared a day or two after our post on Tragedy and Farce. Ntokozo Qwabe’s view exemplifies the well-intentioned but misplaced conflation of political correctness, moral relativism and anti-imperialism which has dominated the debate about Empire for far too long.\nOf course, Empire was “problematic” but not in the way imagined. When the likes of Rhodes and others took charge of parts of Africa, they saw the potential to spread Christianity and without being aware of it to proletarianize those who could be taken out of the tribe and put in workplace. With slavery abolished and tribalism in decline these proletarianized workers contracted as “free” labour, had choice about who they worked for and consented to remain with their employer having in theory at least the chance to leave if they wished to. Now cries will go up that this was exploitation on a grand scale. We agree it is exploitation but disagree it was wrong if the result is greater freedom for all eventually.\nWhat Rhodes and others did was replace the poverty brutality and overt sexual discrimination of tribal life, it’s uncertainty and ritualistic practices and allowed modern values and agricultural techniques to generate greater economic value in Africa than the indigenous population could hope to have created by repeating ancient rituals and tribal superstitions. Like we always say, life is about value; how you create it, how much of it you have, who controls it, and what you do with it. Admittedly the tribal social values were pushed aside, the certainty of gender based social roles dispensed with as women were offered a degree of liberation. So, with more flexibility of labour, Empire was able to generate much greater value upon which there was greater wealth to distribute. There was more certainty, as science replaced superstition. The world of western science had started to replace world of tribal ritualism.\nNow Ntokozo Qwabe makes a couple of points which whilst perhaps true, typify the limited and constrained nature of the debate. Firstly, the value taken, as he says the “resources and labour of my people” were acquired by the Empire builders but they, in exchange, liberated people from what by modern standards would be the horror of tribalism. Where this happened, it took women away from the savagery of FGM and assisted people in general to create better lives for themselves. Tribalism whether in Afghanistan or Africa is a way of life that no longer needs to exist; but where it does, lives are impoverished superstitious, obsessive and short and women’s lives often marred by institutional violence and discrimination.\nThe other point Ntokozo Qwabe makes is to claim that Rhodes saw Anglo Saxon culture as superior to African culture. Well if life is about creating value the Anglo- Saxon model was greatly superior to that practiced within tribal societies. The amount of value created by Capitalism allowed wealth for the empire builders (right or wrong) but also allowed some of it to better the lives of the indigenous Africans. To Claim this is racist is to miss the point. Rhodes and others were almost forced to conflate culture and race. It’s how it was for them; black people lived in ineffective tribal groups; westerners had the advantage of scientific methods to drive up value and create a way of life that reduced fear and uncertainty for all. And moreover, Marx would have agreed with Rhodes rather than Ntokozo Qwabe.\nIf we imagine that the ancient Egyptians had arrived in east Anglia in the UK in say 3000 BC, they would have taken the view that the tribal groups there were ineffective at providing high levels of value allowing a structured and secure way of life for all.\nThe Egyptians too may have made an association between skin colour and the British tribes shortcomings compared to themselves, as without doubt the Egyptians along with the Samarians were able to establish a form of feudalism whilst many cultures were still tribal. They may like the Romans much later have seen Britain as a country of savages.\nNtokozo Qwabe is benefitting from the economic system that has liberated him and could go further and liberate his continent from separatism, tribalism fear and war. It does not help the process of positive change when people criticize and attempt to destroy capitalism in Africa (and other places) and expect the result to be “socialism”. Socialism only comes through the birth canal of capitalism and through no other birth canal.\nThis move to socialism without passing through a capitalist phase never happens…. it can’t until people understand the concepts of contract, choice and consent (usually by being part of a capitalist economy at some point). In the absence of this understanding and full acceptance of Contract Choice and Consent plus a value generating economy society will only ever slide back to either tribalism or as we said earlier this week, with the help of an imperial civil service, feudalism can replace a failed or not yet fully established capitalism. The failure of ‘over ripe’ Capitalism in Europe in the 1920’s gave rise to a form of “technological feudalism” called fascism. Immature capitalism in Russia gave us Leninist-Stalinism.\nIn Africa and the Middle East today we have in too many places collapsing feudal societies and their relentless slide into tribalism. In Syria feudalism is sliding into tribalism and in Western inner cities, crime empires are, and always have mirrored feudalism but with turf wars over drugs and prostitution even inner-city gangs are adopting tribal values. The western elite don’t get this and the so-called revolutionaries like Russel Brand don’t seem to grasp it either. The moral practices of these nations or inner-city groups reflect the economic reality that they operate within be that tribal, feudal or free market.\nCapitalism has failed its global mission but has left a slightly more permanent imprint in the west with its ‘market-based economy’ founded on contract choice and consent. Unfortunately, the failing market-based society (as opposed to market-based economy) undermines it and leads to corrosive “secular westernism”. The danger is that by criticising the bourgeois wealth and liberty creators of the nineteenth century Ntokozo Qwabe simply undermines the system that may still liberate the non-westernised world but with people like him the west is not out of the danger zone yet.\n29.12.15 Acceptance of all faiths and none: How far is this determined by economics?\nReference has been made to the British being accepting of all faiths and none; a fact which we at Blue Revolution whole heartedly endorse. No country apart perhaps for the United States has done more to welcome and integrate those of other faiths than the British but there is another side to this good news story. This accommodation has more recently been made at the expense of our Christian heritage as much as because of it.\nin the past British willingness to accommodate all faiths was largely due to Britain’s capacity to absorb labour due in large measure to its thriving capitalist economy; the ethic of which was to take people who had productive capacity and turn them into workers or as Marx would describe them the proletariat. The most ambitious of these used the opportunity of freedom underpinned by contract, choice and consent to carve themselves a niche within the system that began by employing them.\nSo far so good; Christianity in the form of Britain’s Protestantism driving a well-tuned economic machine which grew with enough vigour to allow immigrants to be absorbed painlessly into the economy and thence into society. The “morality” of the system was driven by the needs of the economy, so all had to yield something of their culture to the demands of the economy but as within the United States there was scope to practice the old cultures too in what was described as a social ‘melting pot’.\nThe UK’s post war settlement created a new “socialist” environment which saw the state owning and running industries and the empowerment of the working classes which resulted in a model for wealth redistribution with the “state” acting as the conduit for re allocation of wealth from business to the workers. The idea that we have rowed back from “socialism” is true only in the sense that today Britain has had to abandon re allocating capitalist wealth which was created by capitalism’s workers and now re distribute government debt to the taxpayers having created an army of state employees and a growing army of the welfare and health care dependent.\nThe upshot of this “progress” is that Christianity has been undermined by the state and this has fed what we call “secular westernism”; the pursuit of personal stimulation and self-advancement and the abandonment of personal and collective responsibility to the state. The Post war settlement only worked when the value upon which the wealth was created and distributed was created by an army of workers rather than by a handful of financial institutions.\nWelfare once shorn of its legitimising Christian influence (to get individuals back to productive independence) became the progenitor of a new class of non-worker who simply settled down to collect benefits and live an aimless life of unemployment and poor health. This is where the relevance of our title comes in as into the ranks of what is colloquially known as the ‘underclass’, comes a whole class of immigrants who are also able to avoid the demands of contracted employment and the personal growth that goes with it. Contracted employment is an activity that forges a deep commitment to “freedom” based on Contract, Choice and Consent. Some settle into an angry aimlessness and a state subsidised obsession with faith as the end goal of life as is clearly spelt out in various Hadiths of the Muslim faith.\nAs we settle into secular western ambivalence Christianity has given up being little more than a cheerleader for the post war settlement in the UK. This coupled to the economic change that economic value produced by workers is now eclipsed by dependence on debt and welfare based consumption offers the newly arrived and more traditional faiths the opportunity to try and stop our apparently relentless decline into ‘ignorance of faith and moral depravity. In Belgium and France, we see much more worrying evidence of this process than we see in the UK. There is no point in welcoming people and then allowing them to settle down to generous welfare, subsidized to stay out of step with what freedom means to people of the west.\nSo, Britain has been a tolerant country and has a proud tradition of integrating migrants. The last thirty years may through welfare, the decline in the role of Christianity and the sheer number of migrants who have no heritage of freedom based on contract, choice and consent, undermine what can still, just about, be classed as Britain’s proud claim.\n01.01.16 Reflections on 2015 from Blue Revolution.\nIt has been in too many ways a worrying year for tolerance and acceptance of all faiths and none. At the beginning of 2015 we were shocked by the murder of staff at Charlie Hebdo with too many random acts of terror littered in between, culminating in the Paris shootings. Western countries and we include the Russians in this, are now exposed to terror for trying to tackle the horror of ISIS. Yet whilst the west tries to tackle ISIS it continues to turn a blind eye to similar regimes that, whilst seemingly “civilised” by virtue to being trading nations are really autocratic bureaucracies and are as intolerant and brutal as the criminals of ISIS. By this we mean Saudi Arabia and Gulf States\nTo bring some coherence to this conflicted situation , the west needs to identify a coherent narrative which leads and inspires the world and makes a clear demarcation between the “values” of the west up to and including freedom and those of other cultures which whilst promoted by legitimate governments, operate to separate and discriminate on the basis of faith, sex, gender and sexuality.\nThe problem with creating a coherent western narrative is that the west has a whole load of problems which undermine any attempt to credibly achieve moral equivalence with more rule bound and brutal cultures.\nThe Sultan of Brunei’s restrictions on Muslims celebrating Christmas is probably as much about what Christmas has come to represent in the west as it is to simple religious chauvinism. The challenge for the west is to try and achieve a culture which promotes “freedom” based on the capitalist/Christian concepts of Contract, Choice and Consent, whilst reigning in the unintended consequences of lifestyles characterised by industrial scale illegitimate birth, divorce, adultery, pornography etc. We at Blue Revolution are not concerned with a person’s sexuality any more than we are with gender or sex (other than to promote equality and fair treatment for females) but we are concerned by social decay and the proliferation of unsustainable lifestyles of all types. We would argue that Darwinian theory rejects any social system that promotes self-interest at the expense of the family, the community and wider society.\nThe situation the west has to tackle we call “secular westernism”. It is the modern culture of pursuing self-interest based not on wealth from productive activity (creating social and economic value) but on “wealth” created through consumerism, government spending and welfare.\nThe free market is amoral and has been used by many who are immoral to create wealth for themselves at the expense of the rest of us our children and the planet. These immoral wealth creators undermine social values and bring about a slow social deterioration which requires government intervention to mitigate its effects; more welfare and healthcare! This process also undermines any attempt to be ecological as more housing and consumption is the outcome. In fact, as in the UK today economic “growth” is in too many ways a vicious cycle; welfare funded social decay masquerading as sound economic stewardship. It’s complex but think about it.\nAs far as we at Blue Revolution are concerned therefore the arguments of the so- called ‘left elite’ are incoherent because the adherents of “welfarism” fail to recognise the full corrosive nature of the social decay created in their name. They also fail to understand the life limiting effects of welfare on the individuals trapped on welfare. Additionally, the left also fetishizes the need for more state intervention to correct the declining social reality welfare creates. Hence the growing epidemic in mental health problems. We believe in welfare but not if it dulls resilience and self-reliance and promotes the social annihilation of the family.\nSo just as in a Dyson vacuum cleaner there is more than one vortex’s operating simultaneously; the “growth through social decay” vortex and the necessary “growth of “good” government” to sort out the mess. Neither is sustainable and neither are the solution to the west’s problems. Accepting this is the challenge for the west in 2016 and beyond. The people, not the government need to act and to understand the nature of the wests problems and then by becoming “Blue Revolutionaries” do something on a personal level to contribute to the wests economic and social recovery.\nPeople should use their vote to support governments who want to row back a little from the march towards the kind of elite big state socialism of the last seventy years. Big state socialism is elitist and unfair the EU arguably being by far the greatest exemplar. Another example this time of big state elitism is the farce of the Paris agreement where the “public” wanted to make no changes to their lifestyle so left it to governments to negotiate what these would be but governments have no public legitimacy to do this so all agreed to collectively hand wring on behalf of their populations.\nIn respect of other cultures with perhaps extreme Islam (be it in Saudi Arabia, or Iran) at the most intractable end, they need to accept that the west struggles to understand the causes of its problems and does not deliberately try to promote unsustainable lifestyles that intelligent people of all faiths and none would find it difficult to encourage such as casual sex, and intergenerational welfare dependence.\nThe west just lacks understanding and a coherent response to the problems its “market-based economy” has created. The non-western countries need to work with the west to stop the terrorism that is intended to destroy the west and perhaps show some understanding that with the wests freedom comes the contract, choice and consent and thus allows individuals to fail and slide into immorality.\nFinally, the review of 2015 suggests to us that if we could promote, as the basis of our narrative to the world, Contract, Choice and Consent then the west may be able to come to peaceful and constructive accommodation with non-western regimes. These regimes may wish to recognise that with our cultural components in place the future for their citizens are less likely to be compromised by the growing demand for freedom leading to repression and civil war.\nHopefully this may happen without the decline into social problems which has characterised the wests early adoption of freedom as a way of managing society.\nHappy new year.\n04.01.16 Compare Saudi Arabia and Iran to observe the different economic factors which should be used to understand ISIS\nClaims that ISIS are beaten or are on the back foot and are, losing territory are largely irrelevant to the overall life span of this disagreeable group of thugs.\nIt is unclear how ISIS are funded or indeed how they are trying to manage the complex business of winning hearts and minds, so they achieve a level of legitimacy required of any state. In the absence of wide scale legitimacy ISIS are not a state they are a group of people who have taken over parts of a state and are now systematically destroying it by pursuing their seventh century dust bowl interpretation of Islam through terror and their brand of religiously sanctioned brutality. They will, as a result of their economic illiteracy, fail hence the reason they threaten to take their terror abroad. We at Blue Revolution are economic determinists; If there is no coherent economy for ISIS there is no state and no coherent society.\nSaudi Arabia is an interesting country to compare with ISIS; Saudi Arabia is a wholly functioning state with a standard array of State attributes for example Defence, Education, Health and Justice Systems. However Saudi Arabia is a country that holds that harsh punishments including death by public beheading are a legitimate way of dealing with the consequences of an individual’s personal weakness, as well as for real crime such as murder.\nThe whole structure of government and the Saudi nation is paid for by oil that is simply pumped out of the ground and sold to an oil guzzling west. This is an under considered fact about Saudi Arabia; it is nothing without oil. ISIS are nothing full stop. For too many other North African nations “Tourism” is almost a proxy for oil and just as precarious in the long term too. The whole region is therefore at risk of long term economic and societal failure. Particularly if Islam returns to more puritanical regimes elsewhere in the Muslim world.\nThe message therefore is that unless one has an economic vision and one which is coherent with the needs of the global labour and technology markets (competing with nations like China and India Europe and the US) one cannot optimistically call ones state a “State” with a long term future. If one relies on just one natural commodity one is in a precarious state. The vulnerability of Saudi Arabia once the oil runs out, can’t be lost on the Saudi princes and may explain the regional hostility to Saudi Arabian monarchy and some recent executions.\nIran is in many ways no less intractable on punishment under Sharia law than is Saudi Arabia. The execution of gay men is commonplace. However, they are a country more embedded within the global family of nations from the perspective of aspiration, technology, and a view that their economy needs talent and education to achieve its economic objectives. With this foundation, the way Iran does business makes it more compatible with the west. This may seem odd as the west’s relationship with Saudi is recognised as that of an ally, whereas until recently Iran was classed as an enemy. Taken over a span of many decades however the consequences of picking attractive but incompatible allies (particularly if they have oil) resembles that of choosing attractive incompatible partners; the relationship will be profitable for as long as you can pretend you have something in common.\n07.01.16 The Labour Party: A party for women. Oh yeah!\nWe at Blue Revolution are going to get unusually controversial because we going to explore the claim made by two Labour party activists, one an MP that the Labour Party is the party for women. No party in our opinion can really claim to be the party for women or indeed a party for ordinary men. The country is too diverse to enable this claim to make any sense. Women like men have a variety of aspirations and expectations that may be positively influenced by the tax and benefits system or they may not. Similarly, the nature of the economy dictates terms too, as does the culture based upon it. All this is positively received or frustratingly runs counter to the expectations of individuals or indeed their best interests\nWhat these Labour party spokes women said was “promoting the interests of women” was little more than the self-defeating consequences of social engineering, that started out in earnest under Blair’s “New Labour”.\nThe modern, state regulated mixed economic system, present in most advanced western economies seems to us to financially advantage a certain type of middle class individual who benefits from either a well remunerated government job, or a well paid jobs in industries that rely on that Wizard of Oz commodity “consumer confidence”; banking for example. So, if we park these people to one side, we can look at the rest of society and look at how our “social Engineered” society has evolved since let’s say the 1990’s and how it has affected people, but in particular, women.\nFor far too many house price inflation and debt is a substitute for real value-based earnings. House price inflation coupled to a weakening of the Christian marital contract of “for richer or poorer” has resulted in many couples breaking up. Just when the “richer or poorer” clause should have come into its own too many couples discover they have a nice little nest egg within which they sit uncomfortably together, stressed out with children and no longer fired up with our modern interpretation of love; namely lust, so they leverage and part.\nMarriages break down, children are separated from parents usually men, and women (and men) go off in search of “love”. The escalating rate of sexual abuse and domestic violence reflects this “sociological” change. As does the unrelenting increase in the number of “single mums”; too many of whom are on benefits and have “boyfriends” and can’t help bringing up children with an array of emotional problems or exposure to sexual abuse but may also be committing various types of benefit fraud.\nWe must not forget though that this “sociological phenomenon” has been socially engineered, because it drives consumerism, and drives the housing market and makes people feel “good about themselves”; or it is assumed it does it.\nWe don’t have numbers but in the UK the volume of “reconstituted families” and single parent families is something the “system” does not record. It would be too morally embarrassing to admit the numbers and that outside of the “state employment sector” the next biggest driver of economic consumer confidence is probably welfare, with its blend of “in” and “out” of work benefits delivered to a hotchpotch of fluid family units.\nNow the balance sheet! By treating women as though they as a vulnerable sex as much prone to ‘unwanted’ pregnancy as their Victorian forbears we undermine their moral capacity and we do it with welfare. Unlike the Victorian who had to show moral restraint to avoid unwanted pregnancy, the modern female (and male) must show little if any restraint. This diminishes for the women the vast array of non- biological sex-based opportunities that may be available for her. For the modern woman sex is casual and sadly a social expectation. For those of faith or of a Darwinian persuasion, this leads to casual procreation; not the pursuit of social improvement but a race into the evolutionary grave yard.\nInto this environment (and I’m not talking about the state employed or well remunerated private school educated middle classes) children are exposed to uncertainty and loss of dads, grandparents, homes, friends etc. It creates a range of personality problems for young people that lead to promiscuity or violence and require more of the soothing balm of state intervention, health services and welfare to mitigate its harsher side effects. The demand for better mental health provision is all the evidence we need that we are getting something wrong.\nIt is the girls who lose out the most in the “socially engineered” but inhumane system. Boys expecting, nay demanding sex and not just pleasurable sex love as Karl Marx called it. Boys who are insecure, unreliable and porn exposed are by and large an unappealing catch, so relationships last just long enough to pop out the next clutch of welfare babies.\nThis is a society without its Christian anchor points, a society that promotes the very characteristics that Faith and civilisation have been trying to overcome since the beginning of time; namely fear, insecurity and uncertainty. Incidentally Sharia law is seen by a growing number of men and women as the antidote to what we have described above. Sharia law would solve the problem and its advocates know this, but at what cost freedom and what cost to women?\nFinally, with the breakdown of the family and the decline of choice for too many women to achieve more than their “traditional” role as mothers, but without the traditional security of a loving family to help them, the final humiliation for women comes in old age. With no independent wealth derived from a life-time of work and saving, and with a malfunctioning or estranged family, they slide into old age, too often alone, but “managed” by the state, the State acting, as in their early life, as a proxy the family.\nThis is an unintended nightmare and parody of the post war settlement, and its then proud boast; the state offering support “from cradle to grave”.\nSo, when the Labour Party wants to claim to be the party of women we ask; how so?\n09.01.16 The EU reaping the whirlwind of naive policy on immigration.\nThe immigration situation in Europe is unavoidable. The Arab States and North Africa have been kept in a state of perpetual adolescence by the British, United States and European elite as to their advanced economies took advantage of these politically under-developed Nations and could make a living simply providing oil or cheap holidays in the sun. Now due to economic under development and Western foreign and economic policy wars people are forced to migrate from nations on the slide back to tribalism.\nThe complex nature of Capitalism with its free but unequal relationships and core of Protestant Christian theology (Which we at Blue Revolution maintain gave rise to the economic trinity of Contract, Choice and Consent) drove a period of productive growth and economic expansion that continues to provide enormous wealth for those fortunate enough to be on the right side of the debt based twenty first century economic equation. Unfortunately, as peddlers of essentially one product Arab and North Africans are on the wrong side of this equation.\nWhat European as opposed to British “Capitalism” has failed to do is leave a capitalist legacy south of the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike the European Empires the British left proto “Capitalism” a legacy which whilst not perfect and exposed too often to the corruption of dictators has seen many African nations withstand the inevitable slide back into tribalism. Tribalism as we have said before is a form of social order that is rule based and discriminates against others and women.\nHowever we see tribalism returning all over the world in the same way we observe authoritarianism consolidating or even re-emerging or in the case of Iraq being destroyed by a naïve US/UK Foreign policy that believed it could impose “democracy” on a country that had a heritage of submission both to God and to the secular state.\nWhen you destroy authoritarianism as in Iraq you get tribalism and the desire to fight until a city resembles one of those pop-up car parks you see in modern city centres before the developers move in do the final pulverising. To think the UK and US considered going after Assad and even flirted with the idea of bombing Iran is absolutely frightening. These policies would have ushered in Armageddon, not with nuclear weapons but with a slow relentless guerrilla war, destruction of the west from within.\nSo, what do we at Blue Revolution consider to be the answer to what is clearly the worrying corrosion of advanced western values by gangs of uninvited guests fleeing countries destroyed by a combination of tribalism and western hubris?\nFirstly we need to understand that western culture is not about “democracy” per se. “Democracy” and “Freedom” are by products of Contract, Choice and Consent and the only way you get these dispensed on a mass scale is through the development of a capitalist economy…Sorry all you lefties but go and read your Marx again…….. and properly this time! So, we need to get our “guests” into the habit of working for their wages and to stop the subsidisation of idleness through welfare. Welfare for westerners is bad enough (see previous posts) but for people whose politics is theological and who’s theology goes little further than worshipping God, welfare turns them quickly towards thoughts of the creation of a European Caliphate.\nWe misunderstand this essential point at our peril, just look at Copenhagen and other European cities and tell us that we are really looking after the interests of western women by allowing men to systematically abuse them driving them through fear back into the home and off the streets or only to venture out accompanied or with a male relative; sound familiar?\nSecondly, we need to get the technocrats who run Europe to understand that money invested in jobs for migrants now they are here, is money well spent. The devil makes work for idle hands. We also need to recognise that the likelihood of any Arab or North African nation accepting “Freedom” based on Contract, Choice and Consent is unlikely within at least three lifetimes and containing the tribal impulse may need some form of slowly evolving feudal structure until “enlightenment” descends.\nThe EU could do this in North Africa and leave EU countries alone to get on with running themselves. We don’t need the EU, but North Africa does. Spending the EU levy to keep people in their own country and working to build their own “free” society would be money well spent.\nThe EU should be working with Assad and others and developing the Capitalist economy in the North African region as well as helping Africa to become the world’s breadbasket by removing barriers to trade. Not doing these things undermines Europe morally as well as economically and socially. The left will object but again go back to Marx and read him properly this time.\nFinally, we must accept we have been wrong over the last 80 years in respect of our policy towards the countries now devolving into chaos. And yet we don’t change tack. We have the Saudi’s, another “infantilised” nation with their oil wealth. Let us not remain silent about them, they may be our neighbour now, but they are not our neighbour out of choice more necessity. Who else can buy their oil and sell them state of the art weaponry?\nLet us also look at ourselves. “Secular Westernism” is a grotesque development of free market capitalism that has evolved because the west has lost its appetite for Christian moral behaviour. If we want to have morality springing from within each of us, rather that imposed from outside, we need to get a grip on the tendency of the market to commodify everything including sex and human relationships. Perhaps this is the biggest challenge for the west and will determine whether we succeed, or we fail to move the world towards a culture recognised globally as “good” as opposed to various types of bad.\n16.01.16 David Cameron suggests lessons in family life and the EU lessons in how to treat women AIMED AT MIGRANT MEN. Both are missing the point.\nDavid Cameron believes that the lamentable state of family life for many children in the UK can be addressed by “lessons” in how to be a family.\nThe EU equally baffled by what to do about the situation they now find themselves in with migrants roaming the street in search of single women who according their simple Islamic culture are immodest and are therefore offering themselves for sex by their “immodesty”, offer a similar solution.\nNeither really hit the point; both are a bureaucratic response that skims the psychological surface of the problem. Here at a Blue Revolution with our collection of divorces, failed relationships and reconstituted families have an alternative analysis but as with all revolutions the solution is neither easy or without pain.\nThe issue of attitudes towards family life and the way migrants treat women is fundamental to the values of the individual. It is a bit like the attitude towards debt. You know how much forbearance you have towards acquiring debt; some totally opposed to it, others rack it up and then some more. Having ‘lessons in debt’ would achieve little unless there was some “pain” that resulted from the levels of debt acquired; mere lessons would quickly be forgotten when outside of the classroom and the gains and losses could be rationalised and the conclusion reached that justified ones attitude.\nShifting social attitudes is always problematic and over thousands of years attitudes are shaped by the interplay of economic, religious and social factors. In simple societies attitude shifts are often met with a violent response until over time the economic logic of the change is apparent. And so, it is with “family life” and “attitudes towards women”. We have two different problems here, but we have one single solution. The solution is “exposure to moral hazard”.\nThis is how we at abluerelovution.com we believe it should work. Firstly, the financing of family life is returned to the employment market as opposed to being state subsidized irrespective of the “competence” of the parents. An economically “competent” couple who manage their finances competently (whatever that looks like as long as it is legal) can offer competent parenting. The current arrangement where “welfare” babies are born to the unemployable and often criminal are a social aberration that will undermine the strength and vitality of our economy and therefore our future.\nWe bang on about CONTRACT, CHOCE and CONSENT as the building blocks of a free democratic society and for this to be preserved, democracy needs to have new generations of those who have an embedded sense of Contract, Choice and Consent. This is where bureaucratic Socialism goes blindingly wrong, by compromising the three “C’s” the state ultimately undermines democracy.\nSo if your “welfare” baby is born the parents should be given activity to do; environmental work for example, that enables them to pay for the baby, a single parent will need to find a job to support themselves and in the absence of this the baby will be put up for “economic” adoption. Economic adopters are People who adopt but don’t cut the “birth parent” out the equation and get some subsidy from the “birth parent” and state. Keeping these “birth” people on board is important as they are the sad counterpart to the concept of full moral responsibility. Over time the attitude towards parenting will shift. Parenting will be it should be (and is by some) a very responsible socially and economically important job rather than is increasingly the case the product of a morally ambiguous “money shot” from two people who have entitlement and adolescence as their defining characteristic.\nSome will argue that this approach undermines women’s rights, but we say undermining a woman’s economic role by subsidising her biological role is just as undermining and skews the concept of choice.\nFinally, our migrants. Work, Work and more Work. No one should simply arrive uninvited and sit around watching TV and working themselves into an adolescent froth about the absence of tribal or authoritarian “morality”. Give them all jobs, even made up jobs doing environmental work. Also give them a warm safe place in a hostel and tell them to work (i.e. paid private sector employment) their way out of it or go home, when home is safe enough for them to go. To Mr Cameron and colleagues in the EU economics we say this the answer to your issues, economics on a very personal level.\n19.01.16 The Lefts hatred of capitalism is as irrational as the fetishizing of socialism. Both are unsafe in this slippery world.\nRussell Brand once spoke on the subject of capitalism and identified some issues….. let us try and capture his drift:\n” People are becoming hostile towards a western socio political and economic hegemony wot systematically undermines freedom and alienates the masses, creatin anger and alienation wot reflects the malfunctioning of the bankrupt prevailing military industrial system through the disillusioned antipathy of the massed ranks of workers who’s consciences must be raised by a vanguard of revolutionary leaders who highlight the exploitation of the masses and expose the criminal activities of the prevailing elite. Wot needs to change is that the mass energy of the exploited should be turned to thoughts of overthrowing this criminally obtuse system of elite self preservation……..\nWell Ok he might not have said this exactly but it is the sort of pretentious half- baked Marxian waffle he would have said….or, so we at A Blue Revolution think anyway. But whilst Brand had a point, his analysis was woefully short of the mark and his solutions non-existent. But as we say….he had a point, many people have a sense that Capitalism or rather its modern manifestation “the free market” is going a little haywire and with that other things suffer too like democracy, but what exactly is the problem and is the solution more socialism?\nHistorically the role of Capitalism has been to free people from the bondage of servitude within feudal structures in the same way that the servitude within feudalism freed people from the horror and starvation and uncertainty of tribalism. Capitalism without doubt has its problems but the biggest one is that its early manifestations were essentially elitist in character but not in the most obvious way.\nThe elite feudal overlord exploited his tied workers who were bonded and essentially the property of the overlord and his land. In exchange for this arrangement the tied worker delivered his labour unwaged to those who were above him in rank and title.\nCapitalism achieved the task of freeing the tied worker; creating the waged “employee” who whilst free to sell his labour was also “free” to starve. The illusion created was that at this level capitalism was no different from “feudalism”. But of course, in the case of the worker it was. The worker might have been horrified by things like industrialising agriculture and the mind-numbing monotony of the factory system but unlike the feudal worker he could travel freely, move up the social rankings and achieve wealth by dint of his own brain power and effort. Feudalism had few opportunities like this. There were some notable exceptions to this general rule; Henry VIII’s treasurer Cromwell was low born…but Capitalism opened the flood gates to this process of personal improvement. It took centuries though.\nWhere capitalism left a mark, usually where the British empire left its imprint outside Europe, people became workers, not slaves or feudal subjects. Capitalism is what Capitalism does. So, in terms of this process alone people became “free”. Capitalism liberated people and has liberated women, admittedly too slowly but it is the capitalist system driving social change that has brought about liberation, it is sadly not the other way around. The proto fascism of female cultural subjugation was in large measure brought under control by capitalism according “worker” status to women, slowly making the woman a “factor of production” as opposed to subordinated wife or home bound mother. This process of liberating women from biologically determined roles has now been stalled by post war “socialism” and the welfare trap within the western free market system. More of this later.\nCapitalism can only be capitalism when certain pre cursors are present and these emerged about three hundred years ago. These are what we at a Blue Revolution call the three C’s, the essential precursors to Capitalism; Contract, Choice and Consent. It was with these three factors in place that Capitalism began to shift ordinary people away from servitude towards, we admit, a rather miserable freedom. But freedom it was and freedom it remains.\nHowever, the main obstacle to workers liberation and one of the two the main and significant “feudal” throw backs within the capitalist system was that the boss simply replaced the feudal overlord. Workers might be free, but they were still exploited. They got some of what they produced back in the form of wages but the largest chunk of value they created went to the capitalist who acquired and accumulated this value giving rise to the nineteenth century socialists claim that “all property is theft”. The other throwback to feudalism is that the whole system was hierarchical in character. Ranks of managers below the boss, reflected the rank structures of feudalism and allotting a place for all within a class system.\nBut Capitalism had to happen, without it, people would not have been liberated. without it, Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn would not be able to try to arouse the ire of the free “workers”. He would have been slain for treason. Had it not been for Capitalism, large parts of the world would be excluded from an economic family that can trade on equal terms with trust borne of the freedom allowed by Contract, Choice and Consent. So, when we hear the left criticizing capitalism and demanding its overthrow, we ask “what bits of it do you want to overthrow?” because some of it should be kept in the interests of freedom and progress. Chucking out contract, choice and consent to deal with ‘unfairness’ using an elite bourgeois parliament won’t do it at all. It will make matters worse.\nTherefore, for the traditional left-wing we believe this question is a little problematic as the “quote” from comrade Brand we hope illustrates. You simply can’t overthrow an old system without dragging bits of it into your new system. The existence of hierarchy being the bit of the old system dragged into Capitalism with the ever- present threat of its rebirth at any given moment of crisis.\nThe return to authoritarianism in Europe in the 1930’s arose from the collapse of capitalism in countries which were still feudal in character. The slide back into tribalism in the modern middle east due to the collapse of their authoritarian systems; no culture of Contract, Choice and Consent to spur an emerging capitalism so as to create the liberation and freedom the west enjoys (and as our 7 deadly sins suggest we abuse).\nSo, there is a defence of capitalism! A system that gave freedom but with a financial cost to the worker. What of the lefts fetishizing of Socialism and how dangerous is this?\nSocialism would not and could not have happened without the Capitalist system; a point all too often lost by the traditional left wing. The economic model that evolves into socialism has to be based on two of that capitalist systems key features; one is the creation of value on the kind of industrial scale that can only be delivered by capitalism, and secondly to avoid the slide into fascism there must be a genuine observance of Contract, Choice and Consent.\nAll too often we hear the left-wing criticising capitalism whilst offering an alternative which lacks enough of the four components of capitalism namely worker created social and economic value, contract choice and consent to make the new socialist offering both viable financially and fair. The left talks about “ending austerity” without recognising that if your economy lacks the productive capacity to create value, you have nothing of value to re distribute. The usual response is that the government can borrow or nationalise the banks and just about everything else. State borrowing however is unfair as it places the greatest burden for repayment onto the poorest and drives the cost of borrowing up too; hardly Robin Hood. Nationalisation creates a perverse parallel universe in which the benign State becomes the malign capitalist owner of the means of production. Along with other nationalised industries the whole economy slowly becomes a calcified job creation scheme producing nothing that people want other than unproductive government jobs. Socialism is basically a wealth redistributive arrangement. It took a while but in Europe we have learnt that governments do not make good capitalists. In the past these government capitalists created too little economic value. Look at Russia in the 1950s to 1990s the economy raced to the bottom from its high point in the 1930s. Far from “all property being theft” “all property becomes debt”……exactly as it is now and we in the UK are could not cope with more, no really we could not.\nOnce the economy is under the control of the government there is a massive reduction is the amount of Choice, and Consent there is around and indeed the whole “free” basis upon which the capitalist system operates becomes eroded. Rights diminish and the system run by technocrats or so-called experts rather than the people, guide the social and moral agenda. Therefore, lovers of totalitarian ideas from fascists to Jihadists love socialism and these groups hatred of capitalism is why socialists love them back.\nNow arguably when the left talk about economic reform or identify problems with the current economic model they may have moved away from full on nationalisation. But within socialism the belief that governments know best prevails and limits progress. This desire to put government in control is the slippery path from capitalism to socialism as bureaucratic authoritarianism; top down, lacking progress, and prone to collusion, corruption and coercion. The perfect cocktail to undermine freedom anyone could possibly come up with.\nIn this slippery world of Sepp Blatters’ and corrupt regimes, to lose sight of Contract, Choice and Consent and replace them with more incompetent government and a bankrupt redistributive economic model is folly indeed.\nAnd finally the EU is precisely the kind of “government” that is unproductive and bureaucratic, run by technocrats and therefore should be seen for what it is a fanciful 20th century form of bureaucratic authoritarianism. Not progressive at all really……not now.\nSo Russell Brand had a point and if you are still with us, you will recognise that the answer to his problem is not to overthrow all that is capitalism or to replace it with all that is socialism. The answer is a Blue Collar Blue revolution.\n21.01.16 The life of economic value. Where does it end up?\nIn the west some of us delight in the world of the celebrity; we love the antics of Paris this or Justin that and the world of the acting and celebrity profession somehow adds glamour and gravitas to the view that the world is so unfair and poor people need glittery advocates to promote their interests; at no actual cost to the “profession” itself of course. The acting profession and the Z listers who clutter up the day time TV slots and magazine racks have become good at skimming off a hefty chunk of what little economic value the western world creates. The mechanism involves magazines, films and television as well as the new trend for you You Tube celebs offering advice on all things trivial.\nThere is clearly nothing wrong with the entertainment profession; the western world has enjoyed poetry, song and theatre for centuries, and now enjoys Film, TV and Radio. However when one considers that the business of creating value is typically down to those who actually toil in fields and factories with the bankers (services nor speculation) and some of the high export earning celebs (Beatles etc) coming up the rear with foreign earnings (Jeremy Clarkson!) it is clear the vast majority of those celebs who make wealth out of the economic system we call the “free market” are simply acquiring the spoils of other peoples debt, welfare and welfare supported earnings, for little of any discernable value to the individuals concerned. The question is this; is this justified?\nWell whether it is justified depends on your vantage point in respect of wealth and how it is created and then acquired. If as many do, one takes the view that the way wealth is created and is acquired does not matter “one is relaxed about wealth” as one new labour stalwart commented, then the fact that the poorest members of the community are wasting money on frivolous rubbish will be of little concern as long as someone is getting wealthy. If however one takes the view that the stewardship of what ever income or wealth one has (whether it is from earnings or welfare) is very important if one is, as one should be, serious about providing for ones family, one should be saddened about the celebrity culture in the west and the waste that goes with it.\nSo if the likes of Paris that and Justin this start to wonder about the “global hegemony” they needs to look no further than their excessive earnings, acquired largely at the expense of the poor and misguided, to see how they could do their bit to help to sort out the West’s social and economic malaise; they could stop talking stop preening and get a real job.\n30.01.16 Does the world need Britain more than Britain needs the EU.\nThe battle for the votes of the British people in their much fought for referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU is beginning to take shape. It promises to be an emotional campaign full of the usual fury and righteous indignation, shonky statistics, falsehoods exaggerations and half truths on both sides delivered by a collection of “Big Guns” who sell the “concept” in or out one way or the other. This will be a campaign short on facts and honest argument.\nStuck beneath this thick adversarial froth with be the British people, required to take sides with little understanding of what is really at stake. So to get some thoughts in early we thought we would give some pointers as to how we feel at a Blue Revolution.\nWe always talk about “Value” rather than its liquid and easily produced derivative “Wealth”. Value is to economic survival what water is to physical survival. We have consistently argued that how a person country or empire produces value and who gets to control it is absolutely fundamental to understanding how that nation is constructed and more importantly how it works; namely to who’s advantage.\nWe have written about the EU before likening it to a feudal system and imploring people to consider what might happen if the EU gets too well established by say a British yes vote and like all systems an eventual fight to survive might ensues in the face of contradictions emerging. The EU will twist and turn and diminish people power to survive. Now it is time to develop that argument a little further.\nEveryone with a basic education has heard of the aristocracy; these are the people who wield power and to secure their position acquire a nations surplus value (essentially its valuables) based smply on their inherited rank, many will have heard of a theocracy, people who within a faith based rank structure achieve pretty much the same thing and finally the plutocracy a system of power based on who has money or can control money. All are autocratic.\nAs we point out money and value are not the same thing. You can create a lot of money with very little value so a Plutocracy is not the same as an aristocracy but through their wealth the plutocrat controls society rather than through rank as it is with the aristocrat. However power is still wielded top down.\nPost war Europe needed some overarching governance arrangements to ensure that it did not slide back towards armed conflict. Imagine a post war Europe, small nation states decimated by armed conflict twice within 50 years. The EU was an aspiration based on the desire to co operate and build strength through trade and a strong single market. Unfortunately just as all our other “ocracies” have had their day the EU quickly achieved the zenith of its original aim and then settled back into becoming a bureaucracy, and then from that it became a publicsectocracy.\nThis is a Blue Revolution word made up by us at Blue revolution to describe a society where the vast amount of social and economic value is controlled by a public sector paid for by the tax payers. This society consumes value because it has to keep its bureaucrats in work. The question is; does modern Europe still require this bureaucracy, is the work of the bureaucrat still essential as it was when post war Europe needed rebuilding, can we afford to keep this Bureaucracy fed with taxpayers cash? As a substitute for the bureaucracy we have proper trading agreements, a shared understanding of the importance of autonomy among nation states, and we have got over the neurosis of the last two wars, at least in economic terms. We trade with consent, choice and contract so essentially people understand how to operate in a civilised way….we would therefore argue; we no longer need the EU…….no one in Europe does!\nThe argument we would further advance is that the world needs more trade and co operation by those who create the social and economic value beyond the boarders of Europe, Africa and the Middle East for example. We need much less of this unaccountable EU bureaucracy which employs people on inflated salaries, salaries that don’t add social or economic value but is simply personal wealth for the recipients, who as individuals deliver little if anything of any economic worth.\nIn the same way we have thrown off control by feudal overlords and the clergy we should vote against more control by publicly employed Eurocrats and their form of autocracy their EU, a massive publicsectocracy. Down with another ocracy!!!\nThe world can trust the peoples of Europe to co operate and to trade with each other and other nations beyond Europe; spreading the language of trade and co operation based on Contract, Choice and Consent.\nBritain needs to lead the way to a truly global approach to trade by voting “no” to the EU and thus “no”, to yesterday bureaucratic solution to tomorrows global problems. The world needs Britain more than Britain needs the EU and the people of Europe need Britain to vote out to get the blue revolutionary ball rolling.\n01.02.16 Blue Revolution as seen from space.\nAstrounaughts have been quoted as saying on their first orbit of the earth they talk about their nations, the second orbit their continents and the third their conversation turns to discussion about the world. They become it seems shamelessly internationalist.\nInternationalism is usually associated with two ideologies; firstly Marxism lays claim to the original internationalism. The global rise of the proletariat. A few Trots still cling to the idea that there will one day be a Marxist revolution that will encompass the whole world. But modern experience suggests to us at A Blue Revolution that there is little chance of this happening when the recent experience of red revolution is a “vanguard” or revolutionary people of vision, become the government. When government is seen as the means by which “revolutionary” change comes about out democracy goes out of the autocratic window.\nIslamism is the second pretender to the Internationalist throne. But whereas aspiring internationalist governments typically usher in an autocratic system similar to the feudal system, Islamism on the basis of recent experience ushers in Chaos and delivers horror on an industrial scale without even the small scale legitimacy conferred on an actual tribe.\nWhen the spacemen and women are looking at the world they become immune to the nature of the political reality on this planet.\nHowever we at a Blue Revolution have taken the view that it is possible to be “internationalist” without being either a government with feudal aspirations or a rag tag army of jihadists. We rely instead on the fact that more and more people on our blue planet have had their humanity and values installed by capitalism and therefore understand that human relationships both intimate, inter personal and legal are based on Contract, Choice and Consent. The western worlds legacy to our blue planet.\nWith these three harmless words emblazoned on the banners of the revolution (as opposed to their alternatives; corruption, collusion and coercion) people can begin to evaluate their contribution to the cause of Blue Internationalism with its underpinning fairness and equality.\nInternationalism cannot be delivered by governments or quasi superstates like the EU….Their role is to protect individual people and businesses who are operating from within their jurisdictions thus promoting trade. This process of trade will eventually extend to people from other nations for the benefit of mankind.\nAll freely trading nations lift their people out of poverty and move their societies towards greater freedom and democracy for all. The only word of caution has to be that to achieve this internationalist goal there has to be a moral dimension to the “global free market” which does not encourage actions which promote moral decline. Our seven deadly sins and secular westernism sum up these risks. However with the renewed prospect of real social and economic value being created through co-operation between real economies by real working people as opposed to bureaucrats there will be less need to manufacture “wealth” (ie by QE) wealth which ends up in the hands of plutocrats like “Donald Trump” and Hugh Heffner.\nWhen David Bowie sang “planet earth is blue and there is nothing I can do” we would respond with; yes there is, look at the planet and join a blue, as opposed to red or even green revolution. In today’s toxic world only ours is truly internationalist revolution…….but also perfectly safe.\n04.02.16 The EU must accept Brexit…its progressive.\nWe sometimes disagree at a Blue Revolution. Like everyone in our neck woods the EU is testing us. Some of us were solidly in and others solidly out. But overall the arguments in and out are on the basis of different parts of the debate argued simultaneously and there are further splits generationally.\nYounger people are on the whole pro EU seeing the economics of membership as essential to the survival of the UK. Statistics are used in the argument which are compelling and suggest that the possible consequences of Britain leaving the EU would be economically catastrophic. There is little evidence that this catastrophe is likely to happen….but it is a strong an powerful argument. Alongside it is the power and influence argument; we would loose power and influence if we left. On the other side of the debate we have older people who perhaps measuring the changes brought about since our membership of the EU sense that things are not quite as they expected them to be; too much immigration; too much power transferred to the EU too many restrictions and regulations.\nThe problem with this dichotomous debate is that it lacks a certain vision on both sides, but this lack of vision is without doubt most pronounced on the “out” side. Young people like vision. It is therefore from the perspective of the young a case of “In” is progressive and evolutionary and “out” is little Britain in decline. The “Out” campaign has nothing with which to build what seems to be their limited “out” vision, aside from memories of the 1970’s and echoes back to Parliament as sovereign. Thus the Out campaign is characterised by its opponents as being led by wonks, anoraks and weirdo’s and looses credibility as a result.\nAt a Blue Revolution we are people who like to think of ourselves as visionary so for us the reality of “out” is not quite so simple as unhappy feelings and a few historical facts. Here is why.\nBritain was the first nation to industrialise and to drive capitalism throughout the world via its trade links with her empire. Elsewhere the industrial revolution began to send out into the world via industrialisation the keys principles of capitalism Contract, Choice and Consent. Contract, Choice and Consent are the building blocks of all free s0cieties or societies that aspire to be free.\nThe legacy of Capitalism (apart from Contract Choice and Consent) was to generate economic “value” in quantities that would have been mindboggling to simple tribal peoples. The combination of man, materials and machines made everyone better off and as importantly made life more certain. However some people got very rich and this gave rise to demands for the “product of the workers labour” to be more equally distributed. This would not happen out of choice, all property might be theft but there was no authority who could take it away and re distribute it, at least not until the 20th Century.\nEventually socialism in the form of the state took over in the UK and governments of all colours began, via taxes and benefits, nationalisation and state control to “redistribute” value and empower the working class. To do this ministries were set up and people employed to deliver the state objectives. This process cost money and eventually it began to cost too much and deliver too little so in the UK a general drift away from state control began under the Conservatives in the 1980’s and continues, sort of, today\nWhilst this growth of socialism was going on in the Uk after the war, on the continent, wounded countries came together to achieve peace and prosperity by doing a very similar thing; creating a bureaucracy to manage relationships and economies to ensure peace between people, groups and countries. This process grew into the EEC and then EU and is still seen as an evolutionary process even though the process has really reached its zenith and has started to impede the Evolution of global free trade. Global trade that will be the liberator of peoples beyond Europe.\nThe “Internationalist” Blue Revolution vision therefore cannot come easily from a large mono ethnic and class based bureaucracy that controls many diverse and economically distinct and unique economies. But whilst that is a problem for many it does not have to be the way things are done. No European country needs this Bureaucracy to protect them and to “do their business” and “mediate” for them. They all have a deep awareness of the need to create value by respecting Contract Choice and Consent as the basis for freedom, equality and democracy. The Europe of the 21 century could safely desolve its super state and pass control back to its many nation states. This will promote the worlds next phase of evolution “Internationalism”; taking trade and co operation to the rest of the trading world thereby promoting through trade, freedom, equality and democracy and achieving greater peace in trade than can be found in war.\nThe EU was a reaction to a specific post war problem, that problem no longer exists and the EU now impedes the worlds economies preventing too many coming together to trade using the common language of Contract Choice and Consent. Britain leaving the EU is not the act of a reactionary “old” country but the evolutionary act of a revolutionary country who wants to break away from the political limits of its own continent and go out into the world to trade and trade with confidence.\n05.02.16 The US might introduce socialism with Bernie S but let us hope they preserve self respect and personal responsibility unlike the UK version.\nSocialism is a phase of social evolution identified by Karl Marx which within a Marxian paradigm is the “negation” of “capitalism”. In the west we still occasionally refer to “capitalism” as though our capitalism is the “Capitalism” that Marx would have recognised. Thankfully that capitalism no longer really exists. There are many complex reasons for this but the biggest killer of “Capitalism” has been the drift in the 20th century away from the capacity of “capitalists” to create economic “value” and the drift towards the new obsession with debt based “wealth”. This debt based wealth funds consumer spending or as it is better known “consumerism”. We no longer ask how much value does something have? we ask how much wealth or money can you get from trading it?\nCapitalism was and will always be about creating economic value its inherent unfairness or “contradiction” was that this value created by labour was misappropriated by “Capitalists”. This no longer happens, at least not in the west. The demise of “Capitalism” and the intervention of government have changed the nature of western economies. Initially in Britain there was full on Socialism with state ownership of the means of production; now there is just welfare.\nSocialism in the early to mid 20C and mainly in Europe was the point at which the state began a redistributive programme; taking value from the “Capitalists” and reallocating it through state ownership, health programmes and welfare to the workers. In Marxist terminology the government is giving more of the workers economic value back to them. It started in the UK after WWII.\nThe problem for the west is that the western economies no longer create value in anything like the quantity necessary to support all the welfare and health obligations to which they have committed themselves . We export our value creating requirements to China and within the “free market” the banking system and governments generate debt based wealth. Therefore we only seem to be able to support our people on the proceeds of debt…it is a kind of economic subterfuge; it looks like an economy based on real value but hold on, what’s this underneath it looks just like…….oh my god is it really just cash and personal wealth based on a pile of over-priced houses, stock, collateralised debt obligations and quantitative easing? Yes I’m afraid that is all it is. Welcome to post- industrial economics.\nDelivering “socialism” in the US in something that is long overdue. The likes of Trump, Heffner, Buffett et al simply benefit from debt backed wealth. So whilst Capitalism no longer exists to be “negated” this unfair US system with its strutting coiffured buffoons who somehow benefit more of the proceeds of the nations debt than any one else, needs to be tackled. The workers of the US have had their noses rubbed in it for long enough.\nIn a debt based economy there should be an equality in how much of other peoples debt you benefit from.\nSo US socialism will be debt not value based. In that sense it is like the UK welfare system is now. Debt not value is the contradiction in modern socialist type systems. Debt will eventually overwhelm the Euro zone too and slowly re shape the EU and possibly even the US.\nHowever a word of warning; as part of a “socialist programme” welfare should be a net to catch those in need, not a trap to keep them enslaved to welfare. Any US welfare system should therefore preserve self respect and self reliance and should avoid creating entitlement. failing to promote or maintain self respect and self reliance amongst too many welfare recipients is the problems with British welfare and it therefore undermines any attempt to get back to a more egalitarian “value” based economy. An eonomy where real economic value and real social value are created. An economy which balances the creation of social and economic value whilst preserving personal responsibility one might identify with as blue revolutionary.\n.",

Both managed to attract voters back from smaller parties and maintain the political hegemony. It was like the Heath and Wilson years. Labour with a more appealing cream tea as opposed to the Conservatives threats of Marxism today under Labour. Labour clearly got the youth vote and the vote of those who have been getting the brunt of the Tories ‘austerity’ measures. Austerity it really wasn’t it just didn’t feel very generous and so fed into Labour’s instinct for manufacturing class war even when the only real classes there are these days are the working class and those on welfare.\nSo we have a depleted Tory party in the HoC and a resurgent Labour party. However, from the perspective of a Blue Revolution, it is all just another attempt to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic rather than spot the financial iceberg and steer the ship away from it. The main parties can only offer palliative care to the British economy and society because A) they don’t trust the public to assist them with the task of sorting the problems out and B) the institutions of the state which make so many people very rich will resist reform at all costs. For example, why should we pay for a refurb of Parliament? Turn it into a museum and open a new ‘virtual’ parliament in Milton Keynes based on our legislative college (see manifesto). In a globalised labour market that is exactly what a private company would do. It is what parliamentarians have allowed to happen to our industry and in doing so have created the second and third generation ex-industrial unemployed or as too many of them call them, the underclass. A group that class war Corbyn has seemingly begun to target for their votes.\nThe real tragedy of this election is that we will be encouraged to think someone both knows what the hell is going on and knows how to fix it, when in fact no really does and no one, apart from us, really cares.",

The compensation is the self-justifying pretext for court action but the much more important subtext are the legal costs!\nThe law-makers being lawyers is a breach of the separation of powers but one that the lawyers, that generally quite process observant group are quite happy to overlook. There is also the fact that the law is expected to pay well so lawmakers are paid well too. Lawyer as policy and lawmakers is one reason that the interests of blue collar workers have been overlooked for too long. Our needs are secondary to the needs of the State to protect its officers, members, and hangers-on and keep the whole process hidden by a veil of legal legitimacy . This explains the left alliances (Greens, Lib Dems and Labour Party in the UK’s obsession with staying in the EU). It is only very remotely about trade it is really about maintaining the EU political system for the benefit of the Junkers and Tusks and the UK’s “left-wing” hangers on and duff politicians . For their “class” to survive the EU has to survive. This makes what the UK did in voting out as cutting edge revolutionary as anywhere in the word for many, many decades; possibly even centuries. Well done. The Blue Collar revolution starts from here. The three millennia of rule by one elite after another will start to change from here on in.\nHowever, there is one element of UK domestic policy which we believe is exploitative and which also supports the State’s overall aim of maintaining control for its elites which justifies well-paid state employment at the highest level. And that is the subsidisation and growth of the underclass. This shameless bit of social engineering has cast millions of lives into a mire of hopelessness resulting for males in drug, alcohol and crime and women into premature motherhood before that are emotionally equipped to look after themselves let alone a small defenceless child. The advantage of this horribly broken system is that it allows the left wing parties to talk the language of caring whilst promoting a system which keeps workers paying and the state receiving and the underclass locked into a moral and economic “double lock” that allows them little chance of escape. The underclass feeds the State monster, directly through the need to manage them via government jobs and government departments such as the Justice department and indirectly by encouraging workers from abroad to migrate to do low skilled work, thus pleasing the EU overlords. Migration puts pressure on the housing market so housebuilders do Ok as does the Government via taxes on building and sale.\nWe believe the Blue Collar revolution, the proper worker’s revolution needs to tackle the problem of the exploitation of the worker’s root (the underclass) and branch (the elite)\n23.10.16 Contract, Choice and Consent; a Blue Revolution’s global “trideology” for the rest of the 21st and the 22nd century and beyond.\nThe “ideology” of the EU and we have recently concluded the “ideology” of “New Labour” (RIP) are similar in one specific respect; they are both premised on the belief that social justice can be delivered by a theological or ideological “socialist” state. Free movement of people, whole swathes of people, the very young, the very old and the disabled moved around the continent to access better welfare, education and health all on the “ticket” of often a single “worker”. This is the inception of the dream of the EU social and economic engineers; a continent united in one single belief system and one single market. However it is about 200 years too premature and on this basis, it will break before it can be made to work. The analogy we would use is that the EU theologians are trying to transplant an old established Oak tree rather than cultivate a sapling and take their time over it. They are killing the tree.\nThere are lots wrong with the EU….its currency trapping weak economies into an unsustainable economic model, the free movement of people stoking up resentment for reasons obvious to anyone other than the elite. The over inflation of economies within the Customs Area of the EU luring the illiterate and the morally immature from North Africa. The consequences of “hubristic humanitarianism” on vulnerable EU communities and women.\nSo what is to be done. Well, we believe that to unite the world to encourage growth, trade and reduce the risk of war we need to promote a set of ideas that have obvious moral appeal and to a wide and culturally diverse world, and hence we have distilled “Marxism” and produced a spirit of freedom captured in Contract, Choice and Consent, our “trideology”. These three rights are drawn from Capitalism and are a legacy of that economic model conferring rights that under feudalism were denied to too many people……in fact denied to all peoples.\nThe EU needs to realise that its policy of self-promotion is denying countries that need to develop a modern morality the opportunity to do so it is doing this by discouraging the cleansing of relationships associated with free trade. The EU is not a safe pair of hands and neither is the rest of the self-regarding and the self-promoted western world…and that includes the ideological “left” who see wealth rather than rights as the main objective of their “socialism”. Grow up guys!\n28.10.16 Saint Tone, a Patron Saint of the EU theocracy offers us advice on Brexit. He like they simply don’t get it!\nThe theocrats of the EU have dispatched one of their big guns to patronise and plead on behalf of the EU elite. On the UK’s BBC radio 4 morning show, Tony Blair dished up the usual meal of warmed up “third-way” leftovers and a defence of the EU status quo which confirmed the self-regarding, paranoid and delusional view of economics, politics and society that characterises much of the Remain side of debate.\nClearly, the British people didn’t know what they were doing in voting for Brexit and don’t know what they are doing in continuing to support Brexit. The implications are that much misery will befall them and they will have to rely on their elites to sort out the ensuing Brexit mess. It could not occur to Blair because he is incapable of self-criticism that the politically mature and independently minded British might be prepared to endure short-term problems in some economic areas such as lower house prices and increased inflation as a bi-product of gaining proper democratic accountability and a reduction in the power of the technocrats and the elite. Of course, it is arguable that much of what is going on in the economy is simply a correction ofter years of EU economic engineering. The British economy needs to start living in the real world; the world of risk, value, price and profit and loss. It needs to leave the safe haven of the Alice in Wonderland economics of Tusk, Junker, Schultz…..oh and Blair. This is a world where the Elite game the economy to meet the economic, political and sociological needs of the elite themselves and use the economic levers of mass migration, Quantitative Easing and low-interest rates to create artificial short term “confidence” and thereby maintain aggregate demand across a range of EU strategic sectors. Of course, the beneficiaries of this “economic model” are the elite who fob the masses off with cheap debt and a morally ambiguous liberal social policy. All of this combines to create a long-term toxic blend of expectations and entitlements that the European economy can only hope to deliver in the short to medium term and will fail to deliver in the long term. They will fail because society will falter with too little collective social responsibility and economies will buckle under the strain of debt, ageing populations, mass migration and an absence of proper global competition keeping business sharp.\nWhat Blair et don’t understand because they are beneficiaries of the existing system is that economic value and progressive social values are longer being delivered by Western leaders in the western world. The British public have grasped this ahead of the rest of the EU and are the first to demand something is done about it; Brexit!\n29.10.16 If it were not for the ability to store value or transform debt into wealth would we be able to reveal and then solve the “puzzle of history”!\nIt was Karl Marx who said: “communism is the puzzle of history solved”. However, we have had almost one hundred years to become familiar with “communism” and it really hasn’t “solved”anything. The same goes for “socialism”; grand theories that eventually draw power to the state and thereby undermine society and an individual’s ability to fulfil their “species-essence”. So if everyone from Lenin to Corbyn has got it wrong what does “getting it right” look like. We consider whether the real workers Blue revolution solves history’s final puzzle, thereby bringing about the fabled “End of History”.\nWell firstly whether it is Communism or Socialism the actual application of the principles of both have been poorly interpreted. In the case of “socialism”, the State has shown a great reluctance to diminish its power and control and indeed under Blair in the UK and others around the world “the State” and its army of technocrats has grown as the power of western Capitalism has diminished. With Capitalism now unable to generate sufficient value to feed the workers the arms and legs of the state have stepped in to manage the operating environment of whatever bits of the productive and job-creating economy still remain active in the west. This is essentially managing the environment of the “free market” and ensuring that the real liquidity of the free market namely “confidence” is maintained. This has differed within the various parts of “the west”, but we would claim it is fair to say that the EU’s expansion was a stitch up by socialist technocrats intended to mitigate the effects of capitalism’s drift to cheaper areas of the world, and to ensure they and their class had a job for life. We call these people the “publicsectocracy”; they are the aristocracy of the “socialist system”.\nHas this socialist experiment of state management of the economic environment worked? Well, we would say yes and no. A state takes a lot of money to manage an economy and maintain the politics and social policy which rests upon it. In the UK there has been a programme of social policies since the end of WWII which could be described as progressive and the welfare state; a 19th-century idea now bloated and malfunctioning, was great in its time. Brexit proves however that overall model fails the public’s “sniff test”. Too much debt, too many pointless ” infrastructure projects”, too much immigration to fill up the city centres whilst the indigenous populations flee to the newly built out of town estates, family collapse and re-configuration driving housing demand along with the growing realisation that a worker’s right to a home will play second fiddle to the housing industry, lawyers and government, a government like all governments that needs tax revenue. Immigration, gaming the housing market in favour of builders, and the demand from family breakdown, all justifies what we call the mythology of the manufactured housing shortage. As if all that were not enough there is a moral decline as the free market “marketises” everything base including genitalia and sexual behaviour. What used to titillate older men, sooth the lonely and make schoolboys snigger is now part of the mainstream economy; it has to be, there isn’t as much of a real “value creating” economy left!\nSo overall, socialism has, like the political elite and the underclass it’s two great demographic creations, been around too long. Its army of highly paid functionaries and lawyers has become like the aristocrats of the old feudal system, unwilling or unable to see how they stand in the way of progress. So what of Communism?\nCommunism has never existed anywhere on the planet. The revolutions of the past were industrial revolutions orchestrated by the state which gave rise to rapid increases in the value the economy could create and thus gave a legitimacy to the claim higher living standards were due to “communism” as people became better off. This increase in value based wealth happened in the west under actual Capitalism. Some “Communist” or rather state capitalist societies like post-revolutionary Russia have finally settled back to become more “socialist” in character, rather more along western lines. This seems to us to be because socialism was or is what “communism” in Russia really was namely State control of the economic environment rather than by for and of the people! So in terms of solving the riddle of history, hmmm mmmm. More work to do.\n02.11.16 Trump and the White House yes or no? We endorse diversity so why shouldn’t a man with a personality disorder become President.\nAs revolutionaries, we accept that whilst revolutions in the 21st century should not be blood letting they might be gut wrenching. And so it will be with a Trump Presidency. Trump is clearly a man with one if not two personality disorders the most obvious being narcissism but with a bit of borderline thrown in too and perhaps some……..no we will stick to two. Anyway, we were debating Trump the other day and discussing the aftermath of a Trump win. It was suggested that the CIA might do him in, which whilst always possible in trigger-happy America seems unlikely.\nThe man is a revolutionary in that he has persuaded the sad, delusional and ill-informed that he stands up for them. Corbyn says the same thing in the United Kingdom and has attracted a similar constituency. However, whereas Corbyn’s natural supporters are the neurotic waifs and strays of the democratic process, Trump’s people are the gun toting and paranoid. His people hate the establishment, code word for the Clintons, as much as they fear the lawless underclass. They are sad and emotionally abandoned people though just like the lawless underclass they fear so much. As true apostles of the principles of diversity we at a Blue Revolution, however, fear no one including a President Trump; gut-wrenching as that prospect might be. Even a man with his obvious emotional shortcomings can be president in the 21st century; the US constitution almost shouts that at you as you pop out of the womb on US soil. But why do we think this way?\nWell Trump’s election as President will lead to a whole lot of soul searching as the US considers the implications of electing such an odd character to the highest office in the land, and what such a result will say to the world about the brash, money obsessed and shallow state of the American electorate as engineered, just like the UK’s not quite so lawless underclass, by a greedy and self-interested political elite. But that elite is the alternative.\nWe only had one word of caution about the election of President Trump and that was he has executive control of the codes to launch a nuclear attack. Apparently, these codes can be deployed without challenge by special advisers or military chiefs being used at the President’s discretion, causing a nuclear conflagration in fifteen minuted (four minutes to launch!).\nHowever as we have concluded that in a just world even someone as mad as Trump can be President, it doesn’t mean his special needs don’t deserve some special treatment. Therefore we recommend the appointment of the Presidential psychiatric team, who can quickly step in and deal with the US’s first President with “Special needs” and section him if required. Thus avoiding WWIII becomes a matter of his capacity for office rather than the failings of the US constitution. As our old friend Karl Marx said: “from each according to his ability to each according to his special needs”. With that proviso, we Blue Revolutionaries give a cautious thumbs up to President Trump.\nWith apologies to Karl Marx.\n03.11.16 Sharia courts in the UK! Is this really a problem? We consider the issue.\nSharia courts in the UK are accused of discriminating against women. Well, we consider the issue. Imagine a type of world where a person took responsibility for the decisions they make and were held to account. One might conclude that this is like the contract based western world where you agree to any arrangements you subject yourself to be it an employment contract or a personal loan. However when money is involved the T’s and C’s are usually rigidly enforced not so when the issue is about relationships. In the context of relationships, family life or the mundane humdrum stuff there is no direction or guidance in the west just a government willing to pick up the tab for people’s mistakes. People marry and divorce having children they can’t afford, conduct illicit relationships out of narcissism or a desire to hurt a no longer desired partner. A Sharia court only discriminates against people who have made informed decisions they now want to change. The critical question is; was the decision they made to start with, based on Contract, Choice and Consent?\nWell, the answer to this is quite simple. If the issue that is taken to the Sharia court was entered into willingly and there is no suggestion of abuse or coercion then the matter of the Sharia court is one of ensuring that people behave responsibly. We could do with a kind of Sharia court within the secular western world so we can start to tackle the blight of the irresponsible underclass.\n05.11.16 Uk’s High Court interferes with “Brexit”. The strategic wing of the publicsectocracy opens up the battlefield for the disrupting tactics of the “Remoaners”. Is this how the establishment works?\nA Government Minister resigns and oh he is a lawyer. The High Court whilst resisting the urge to comment on “Brexit” none the less make it utterly problematic to negotiate without the interference of MP’s many of whom are pro remain and lawyers. Add to that the “yesterday’s men and women” in the House of Lords and you can see the UK has a major “democratic deficit”. The Lawyer who resigned did so we imagine so he could throw the full weight of his “Publicsectocratic” mind behind the Remain campaign in Parliament. Of course with a full battalion of Political lawyers the battle to frustrate Brexit will be much easier than winning the public over to the cause of remaining in the EU with its bloated army of technocrats and wafflers.\nWe said it here that the Establishment are largely comprised of politicised lawyers. It seems that we were more right on that that the evidence at the time suggested; we have some more compelling evidence now. The separation of powers, undermined by Blair and his army of subversive lawyers still holds the nation to ransom. And we can see where the counter-revolutionaries are on all sides of the House of Commons. Democracy in crisis: “hell yeah” the country is run by lawyers, not politicians!\n07.11.16 What happens when a “virtuous circle” consisting of establishment action to tackle the effects of economic decline goes wrong. You the workers pay to keep them in well paid work!\nThe trouble with the State getting too involved in things is that its chief box-wallahs find it difficult to put aside the levers of the state when the economy, perhaps due to an over-zealous enthusiasm to intervene fails to help the economy. They believe their intervention helps because it might have helped once when there was a less globalised operating environment for the world’s economies and you could spend value in a largely closed society and could feed your population internally. However, since then the world has opened up and jobs have gone elsewhere and people move about. There is still more of the world to open up too so things could only get worse for the blue collar workers. Unless dear revolutionaries we do something very creative.\nFirstly we need to look at what the “establishment” is up to. They are creating a State that provides the well-remunerated government and legal establishment employment that they and their “enlightened” and entitled class feel they deserve. The colonisation of the legislature by the legal establishment is part of this process. Knowing little about the people in the Blue Collar demographic the legal establishment and politicians of a certain stripe warmly virtue signal themselves by wrapping the idle and promiscuous in a welfare system that keeps them in ignorance, poverty, both spiritual and material, and idleness. It requires the actual grafters to pay for this and then pay for the army of well-paid box-wallahs who extract tax to pay for this wasteful system and of course, their 100k salaries too.\nWhat happens in this situation is that the workers become the victims of the “virtuous” State and we end up with the workers paying for a system that promotes the very values the workers detest but which critically keeps the establishment in work. The outcome at this elementary stage in the revolution is Brexit and possibly Trump. In the UK Theresa May may slowly let the steam out of the blue collar pressure cooker and get us out of the clutches of the rich tax gobbling and entitled EU waffler. If this doesn’t happen then things can only get a little tense and a Blue Revolution may be superseded by a more bloody red one.\nSo what is the answer; well why not make training Britain’s young in proper practical skills easier for the talented tradesman and women of the UK, whilst making it less attractive to employ “off the shelf” workers from Eastern Europe. This doesn’t have to be abusive, simply a shift in focus away from bogus degrees and the student debt that supports “lefty” academics. We only have about a decade left to do this because we still have talented and skilled people left to do the training. This approach will embed workers values rather than the values which demand that the tax payers job is to support the “left” elite.\nSecondly and more importantly open up Britain to the intellectual talent of the Indian sub-Continent and beyond as we hope Mrs May is trying to do. So rather than replace young trainee brickies with Eastern European brickies we can replace the overpaid and entitled elite with a more modest cleverer and moral group of intellectuals from elsewhere in the English-speaking world…..Come on let’s give the establishment elite a taste of their own medicine, at least until Grammar schools deliver our own competitive working class elite. Let’s replace some of our public School elite with skilled and talented migrants. What’s good for Britain is good for the world! It’s been like that since the 18th century!\n09.11.16 Well well Trump won. No real surprise there we supported him too! But to avoid a real mess he has to deliver. We offer some advice!\nThe Trump challenge is to deliver to the constituency of the white working and middle classes who feel that the last three decades have been about undermining their economic status by exporting their jobs; then expecting them to burden themselves with debt to keep each other in work whilst the political elite skims off a little for themselves through the taxation on the debt based profits. In many ways, Trump is a challenge to the “Publicsectocracy” he is not part of the political elite, although we would argue that, in reality, he is a beneficiary of what we call debtamorphosis. His empire has a value a fraction of what it is claimed it is worth a fact he needs to accept, but it has the “worth” it has, because of debt based asset price inflation.\nHowever, there are some words of caution. His spending programme will indebt the USA to an extent greater than Clinton. However where they would spend the money on education and keeping the candle of the liberal establishment a light he will build things and invest in blue collar work but the outcome will not in a globalised world generate the endogenous growth envisaged. The Money will simply flood abroad.\nIn the end, however, Trump’s biggest challenge will be to deliver to the constituency who elected him. A constituency who will expect a quick fix for their alienation and low wages. His context is a country of mass ignorance, of sad embittered people who feel angry; scarily he needs to meet the needs of these people. He has thankfully done on behalf of the public what was needed in respect of the elite. We need less of the expert and the elite and certainly, they need less pay. However, only half of what a Blue Revolution wanted is knocking the elite. Having achieved this he has also to deliver work, wages and the American dream to the alienated masses. Donald, you are like a dog chasing a fast moving car…….however you are the dog who has caught up and has the car clamped between its jaws, what are you going to do with it.\n12.11.16 To the left leaning liberal elite “Populism” becomes fascism. Their hostility however is simply a fear that the “blue Collar” masses will challenge their now faltering social and economic model\nThe word populism isn’t used to explain Clinton winning the “popular vote” but it has been antagonisingly used to explain the upsurge in the “deplorable” vote. Somehow people voting on mass for Clinton is seen as demonstrably different from people voting on mass for Trump. This Trump Blue Revolution is seen as appalling and frightening in equal measure but for us, the worst case scenario would have been the return of Clinton voted for by the smug self-satisfied the brainwashed and downright mislead. The vast majority of Clinton supporters are brainwashed into thinking the Clinton’s “socioeconomic” model has a sustainable future, will deliver for ordinary Americans and will lead to more social justice. On all counts, we disagree emphatically. More of the same debamorphosis, funnelling tax and debt based revenue into the pockets of the elite with the overspill generously handed out to the poor as a form of virtue signalling and all delivered on an industrial scale. The mob of hucksters in the upper reaches of the US political system can’t believe that they have finally been rumbled. Clinton is probably no criminal unless ensuring you do nicely from the tax payer and public sector and big business is a criminal rather than a moral offence.\nOne small additional point we wish to emphasise is that the populism on both sides of the Trump Clinton divide is very much due to Constituency marketing. The Clinton’s went for the economically illiterate but socially aware young, the lower ranks of the publicsectocracy and the wealthy but guilty (similar to the UK’s Champagne socialists) whilst the Trump campaign went for the exact opposite. Both camps, however, miss the essential point about the tensions between their campaigns. People want to see change; the politicians gave them meat they could recognise from their polarised vantage points which achieved the result of getting Trump elected and the popular vote going to Clinton. However, most ordinary Americans (and Brits) are divided on the basis of criteria which is perhaps intended to miss their common interests.\nWhat are these common interests? The real issues that were lost in the polarisation of an angry and vexatious campaign and which clearly need sorting out if a true Blue Revolution is to energise more than about half the population. Regrettably so far only the half who are angry about knowing they have lost out, rather than those who have been seduced by the rhetoric and do not yet know they are actually losing out as well…..they just don’t know it yet. So who are those who are suffering from an “unknown known”? We go in search of the lost constituency of working class voters.\nThe most obvious group are the students. Rightly fed a diet of socially progressive ideals; tolerance to difference etc but at the same time led to believe that these progressive ideas is political as opposed to economic. The free market demands “diversity” let us be honest the marketisation of sex is driven by economics, not politics. We don’t see Hilary Clinton saying “market your genitals”. No, it is a product of economics as so is Gay Marriage, Gay rights, transgendered rights and free movement. Capitalism’s Contract Choice and Consent. To see this as purely political and therefore Clinton’s unique selling point is stupid. Trump may have appealed to blue collar workers and “red necks” but we are certain he has no negative views on most of the above.\nStudents are particularly vulnerable to liberal bull-shit. They get indebted to keep left liberals in well renumerated “academic” work. Work that is unwilling to stray into “sociological” areas that have been vacated by “lefties” since most of the numbers show they are totally wrong about everything social; immigration, big government, family life, religion, contract choice and consent no less. If students thought about their student debt and stopped obsessing about rights, they might see that the biggest threat to their long-term future is the liberal left.\nThe next big constituency is the low ranking members of the Publicsectocracy. These people think that their wages terms and conditions are safeguarded by the state. They are not. The bottom of the public sector is not protected by the top echelons of the state. The top echelons look after themselves first and the tactical end of things end up penalised and privatised. The issues that the top publicsectorcrats cite to the lower order as reasons to be “progressive” are economic rather than political, see above. Yet the economics they promote militate against the lower orders. Most notably unemployment due to immigration, high house prices due to immigration. This con trick that progressive politics is all down to the liberal left is rubbish. People want freedom, contract choice and consent and the liberal left offer the expensive, privileged and inefficient state and then more of the same. Ordinary people should see Trump and Brexit as not about restricting the freedom to be yourself but as liberating people economically from the power of the state; the Brexiteers and Trump supporters should be joined by a young constituency of people who share progressive values and yet see that currently, the power of the State can only deliver debt and unemployment for those who are not part of the elite i.e. 99.7 % of us.\n16.11.16 The dislocation of the State from the people is a symptom of an age old process of evolution. However this time it is the “liberal” state that is thwarting progress!\nDonald Trump, Brexit and the “populism” in Europe and elsewhere is likely to erupt all over the liberal elite. Or as we prefer to call them the illiberal elite. We have been scratching our heads trying to offer a practical application to illustrate why the old ways of doing things are resistant to change whilst the public knows that the western social and economic model fails the “sniff test” and needs to evolve. We had a rather interesting paper sent through to us which we think can illustrate the contradictions between the state and the people and it is concerned with the British criminal justice system. Reading it some people might have to rise above their impulsive anger but if one clears one’s mind of prejudice and tries to actively avoid making too many pre-judgements and assumptions it does open up a fertile area for debate which we think contributes a lot to understanding why the west is in the mess it is in with its general public knowing something is wrong but perhaps not why.\nSo here goes. The criminal justice system has many characteristics which have been carried over from the medieval period. The Judge dispensing justice on behalf of the monarch reflects the systems feudal origins. In the US with no monarch, the term “the people” is used but it is not clear to what extent the interests of the “people” are really considered within the US system. In the UK the be-wigged Judge elevated and enrobed was historically intended to install fear, the aim being to emphasise the awesome power of the state in a visible way intended to intimidate an illiterate “mob”. The point is clear the state needed to emphasise its power and it’s “objectivity” as it dealt with the condemned, intent on breaking them physically and mentally before their eventual and very public destruction.\nBack in those days, the State was the name given to the business of exercising powerful vested interests; the King, the aristocracy and those in lower capacities who relied on the state’s largesse. In constant fear of the mob, justice had to be brutal. Whilst by modern standards this might seem appalling, the system was “just” as if there were a revolution the system that would replace the state would be no less and possibly even more brutal than that overthrown. This was the era of retribution and deterrence. It was an unforgiving system and perhaps reflects the west’s naivety in getting embroiled in regime change in the Middle East!\nBetween the 18th and the early part of the 20th-century things were transforming, as merchants and then industrialists became the vested interests determining the nature of the then modern state. The criminal justice system began to reflect these changes eventually losing some of the brutality as more “industrial” and “scientific” methods were introduced. However whilst the criminal justice system overall might have evolved (with penal policy introducing concepts of reform and then rehabilitation) the courts remained the visible pinnacle of state power, the power over life and death for what was still seen as a largely unpredictable and illiterate mob.\nEven the low crime rate which preceded the first world war was insufficient to shift the notion that the State was under constant threat from a revolutionary mob. There were of course threats, but being realistic they were not existential threats to the nation-state. The state, unwilling to change how it presented itself to the masses, continued to offer an awesome spectacle in court, of bewigged and robed judges and officials dispensing the power of the state with the intent of breaking the miscreant and sending a clear warning to others. Whilst reform and rehabilitation were entering the criminal justice process driven by reformers who were able to distribute capitalism’s wealth benignly, the operation of the courts remained resolutely medieval in character, and so it is today. However, today we don’t have an illiterate ‘mob’ and who exactly are the vested interests shaping the nature of the State and it’s institutions of power and authority such as the courts?\nWell, ‘capitalism’ has given way to the ‘free market’ which unlike capitalism, is an utterly amoral system easily ‘gamed’ by anyone with the money and ability to work out how to best fulfil their own selfish financial interests. Capitalism had its faults, but on the plus side, it created unprecedented amounts of wealth sufficient to reform society and lifted people out of poverty into work and in so doing conferred rights like contract choice and consent. The people who benefited the most were those who previously had been enslaved and powerless, the human property of the feudal state.\nThe ‘free market’ however has only one significant legacy. The legacy of debt pursuing immoral behaviour. Whilst people are now free thanks to capitalism they are also indebted. An indebted, as oppose to illiterate ‘mob’. Whilst still possessing and dispensing power the state like the individual consumer is reliant on debt to enable it to pay for its institutions of power and authority. There is no longer productive western ‘capitalism’ funding benign developments in the capitalist systems interests.\nThe courts, community sentences and prisons come in for critical evaluation within this debt reliant economic context. The courts and prisons are for most people the most visible manifestations of state power, however, they punish the same group of individuals who fund them; the indebted ‘mob’\nbetter known as the general public. This is why the system fails the public’s ‘sniff test’. The public is feeding the system with wrongdoers and the public is funding the system with taxpayers money, the only people who benefit from the modern criminal justice system are those whose salaries are paid for by it. Can this contradiction be resolved?\nSo in summary, we have an economic system which is dependent on debt and a state which relies on mass indebtedness with it’s associated immorality to pay for its institutions of power and authority. As for the criminal justice system, it punishes the same group of people who pay for it through their debt and taxation. Those unfortunate enough to find themselves managed by the criminal justice system are those who are the weakest in this perverse debt based economic model; their behaviour being shaped either by indebtedness or the conspicuous lack of public morality. They are the victims of this immoral system and they are punished by it too.\nThe Courts\nThe British criminal and civil justice systems act as though the early 21st century is the same as the mid-nineteenth century, with the full power of capitalism’s productivity driving the engine of economic and social growth at home and within the empire. Thus the justice system reflects the fact that it believes it is operating in the name of a vested interest and that this vested interest has a different set of demands and expectations from the public, a public from whom they are artificially differentiated. The old tactics of be-wigging, robes, titles and elevation continue to reflect this differentiation, just as it always has done. These practices are a direct link back to the days of the feudal system and thus are at odds with what people actually feel about themselves and their “he who pays the piper calls the tune” relationship to the state and its institutions and powers. Whilst the public are not perceived as a revolutionary mob when they enter the court system, they are treated like one and yet….. it is the public who are in reality now the ‘vested interest’ who pay for this system and the army of staffers and officers who run it.\nThe criminal justice system works on a “just deserts” model. So much punishment, for so much crime! However, there is something wrong with a system that costs the general public billions of pounds, promotes tax indebtedness and operated in a society which exposes the most vulnerable to a corrosive lack of collective morality (divorce, children being raised by the state, widespread sexual freedom or rather an absence of sexual restraint; the commoditization of everything including people).The state and therefore the courts should be representing the interests of the people but in absence of the public being viewed as a legitimate vested interest, the state acts to represent its own interests and in so doing separates its self from the will of the people. We would argue that this is what lies behind the failure of western governments to garner more than 50% public support. This is why ‘the system’ fails the publics ‘sniff test’.\nIf the power of the courts were to be used to reflect the vested interests of the general public who unlike big business actually pay their taxes, then the public would we think demand that a number of things should change. We would guess that there would be demand for the legal profession to be reformed and the roles duplicative roles of Queens Counsel, Junior Barristers and Solicitors modified to create a simple career structure. Justice could be affordable for the workers as of course, it should be.\nSecondly, the notion of Just Deserts fails spectacularly when it is both the public who pay for the just deserts and yet provide the cannon fodder for the “just deserts” system. In reality, who really has their interests served when an 80-year-old sex offender is sent to prison for 8 years at a cost to the taxpayer of three thousand pounds per week? If they understood the system, the public would not demand “Just Deserts” as defined by the state system, they would demand “Justice” and that would mean an affordable “no more harm” approach to sentencing and punishment. More liberal and progressive perhaps than state-sponsored liberal elite!\nA thirty-foot prison wall is not always necessary to deliver “Just Deserts” or prevent “no more harm”, likewise, some cases serially re-offend and just deserts lets them continue re-offending by passing short meaningless custodial sentences. It fails the “sniff test”. This just deserts model does, however, deliver incomes and salaries to a vast array of state workers. thankfully we believe there is not too much reform required. However, the impact of the two changes described above would be catastrophic for the people who currently act “legitimately” as the only vested interest currently recognised within the system; namely the vested interest of the politicians, officials and lawyers of the state.\nCommunity Sentences\nThese owe their existence to a belief at the turn of the capitalist 20th century, that people were not only capable of reform, but they wanted to reform. Back then the culture of the western world was simple, protestant and monogamous. There was, therefore, a simple template against which all could be measured. Capitalism needed sober healthy hard working workers so invested in criminal justice believing that personal reform was not only desirable but also possible. Thus the long march towards the current array of community sentences was started. Today there are numerous interventions and initiatives all paid for by the general public who often feel the efforts to reform are a waste of money and simply create more opportunities to re-offend. Again failing the “sniff test”. The just deserts concept militates against the public’s safety and Queens Peace by keeping the low seriousness, nuisance individuals out of custody. If the criminal justice system was invested with the public’s interest as it was of the capitalists, it would demand that community punishments should be better targetted to those who would genuinely benefit from them. They would not be available for those who due to weakness, stupidity or narcissism feel no need to improve their self-management and reduce the risk they pose to others. For this group, prison is probably the answer.\nPrison\nWe began by looking at the aims of sentencing as it has evolved over the last hundred years: retribution, deterrence and more recently reform and rehabilitation have come to define the role of prison and punishment within a just deserts model. The problem, however, is that prison and punishment do not deliver deterrence, reform or rehabilitation. Prison does not deter or rehabilitate, it is a home from home for too many damaged and inadequate victims of the free market. Men and women who stumble from one social and emotional crisis to the next. The lack of any collective morality permits the system to get away with exercising little if any real influence as they lock people up for a month sometimes a week at a time.\nTo overcome some of these obvious shortcomings just deserts needs to reflect the vested interests of the general public as oppose to the vested interests of the system itself. Those who can be in the community and be made safe should be in the community and made safe, even if it appears to offend the principle of just deserts. After all, just deserts was in the past paid for by a productive capitalist economy. With the now largely broken free market economy and indebted public paying for the system, justice needs to be redefined to make it affordable, effective and defensible.\nSo bringing these threads together, the answer seems to us be some reform of the whole system of justice. Prisons should be used to house those serial offenders and dangerous people who are incapable of managing in the community, irrespective of just deserts, whilst others could gain their just deserts in the community. Just deserts in this latter sense would be delivered by a combination of tracking, tagging, monitoring, curfews, exclusions, loss of passport, driving licence etc; a very punishing regime indeed fulfilling just-deserts at very little cost to the indebted taxpayer.\nSo what is the point of all this? Well, in summary, the Criminal Justice System like all state institutions no longer represents an elite who are responsible for paying for it. The wealth held by rich individuals today is not created by productive “capitalist” type activity it is generally debt based and in addition the wealthy are first in the queue for tax avoidance. So with no wealthy elite paying for the state and getting influence as a result, the state which comprises politicians and lawyers serve their own political and legal interests. The state does not serve the people who pay for it; namely, the blue collar workers and this is why we believe we are getting the Brexit and Trump phenomenon. The disconnect comes from the public not getting the influence they deserve as they are seen by the state elite as merely the people who pay to keep the state serving itself!!! Reversing this is the stuff of a Blue Revolution.\n21.11.16 When there is a global crisis what makes “Tone” think the ordinary man and woman will value his “contribution” particularly to something like Brexit? Sometimes we ask the obvious questions.\nBoring !\n22.11.16 Why are the liberal elite, “elite”? Because they are the top end of the State of course.\nWe have explored the anatomy of the western world’s anomie and we believe that the existence of this goes some way to explaining the success of the populism of Trump and Brexit campaigns. We have enlarged on this theme and we have argued that unlike the past when the “state” promoted the vested interests of powerful economic interests it shies away from reflecting the interests of the public who pay for it and prefers instead to concern itself with ts own interests. Hence we have welfare that has gone mad, a belief that the twin blights of a housing shortage and homelessness are the sole responsibility of government to cure and that correcting every illness from body dysmorphia and infertility to gender realignment and obesity is the responsibility of the state to fund. This creeping over-reliance on the state keeps the liberal elite in well-paid occupations and enjoying “career progression” whilst directing the thoughts of those responsible for paying for it towards the virtuousness of their benevolence. This is socialism. Socialism is expensive and ultimately by the state adopting a passive response towards “mission creep” the public pay for a system that is both expensive and inefficient. Socialism is essentially the “state” doing stuff it wants to do and with no actual contract with the state the public pick up the tab whether they want to or not.\nThe power to guide the activities of the state is what the liberal “elite” are for. We the ordinary person in the street have no say over the state and what it gets up to. So as our last contributor but one suggested we have a criminal Justice System which obsessed with “just deserts” and with prison as the ultimate penalty, regularly exposes the public to the horror of urban crime whilst “manageable” risks end up languishing behind a wall at a cost of thousands per week. The public would want justice and this means protection from harm, not retribution or deterrence those feudal ideas that belong to hell holes like Saudi Arabia.\nAs it is with criminal justice so it is with health and housing. People have become ignorant of the fact that a country has to pay its way and thus the combination of welfare induced social and moral decay (all too evident in too many parts of the western world), naive post-war expectations and health and housing stock asymmetries combine to ensure that the root cause of problems is refashioned to ensure the creeping role of the state is maintained. It is all too evident to us that a good measure of a country’s moral, social and economic health is to gauge how many “middle class” people are in the pay of the state. In the Uk for example if you discounted the state workers above tactical and operational grades there would be a very small “middle class” indeed.\nWould a small middle class be a bad thing or a good thing? Well, the state provides the influential well-paid work for the liberal elite and without the state doing what it does many would be out of work. On the other hand, the public is paying a lot for their state and would be better off with some shrinkage. It is of course, possible to conceive of a state that through the proper contracting arrangement with the public could offer real policy choice and government by consent thus avoiding the “Trump effect”. This rather than the liberal elite’s view that it illiberal not to have an ever encroaching “benign” and informed state to help and guide when needed.\nJust like the debt-laden free market which games the economic system to ensure that it looks after its interests (corporations, banks and markets in the main) so the state and its elite, our state and “our” elite does what it believes is right for us, whilst we the tax payers pay for their pleasure whilst impotently standing by and watching them **** it up.\n25.11.16 Ok Blair, Clagg et al are clearly “counter revolutionary”. What should be the response of a peaceful revolution ?\nWe opted not to examine Blair’s offer to assist Britain with Brexit on the basis that the question of his motive was too obvious to require addressing. Blair is a narcissistic and delusional god complex nut case in the mould of David Ike. However, bonkers or not, he draws in a number of others, all fellow travellers amongst the liberal elite who seem to be scheming to derail Brexit. The view of these people is that the British public are too stupid to know what is best for them and that we need to be guided like children by our masters and betters.\nThe problem with the Blair model as we point out incessantly, is that it is a continuation of the socialist triumph of the state over the individual. This model, necessary after the last war in Europe has over reached and now finances an immoral system which in any period including this one is utterly unaffordable and unsustainable in the long term. However, it is a business model that makes the senior officers of the state and business people who can game the free market very wealthy. This is the EU model and Blair and co do very nicely thank you. The problem, which isn’t being discussed is that this model will eventually collapse under the weight of its unsustainable contradictions. What are these contradictions? Well, public debt is engorged by mass migration, but that translates as a positive figure in the minds of the “Remain” crew making us the “fifth largest economy in the world”. We borrow and spend and it makes our economy look healthy just like with the compulsive borrower and gambler all this stops eventually. Within an economy mass migration is a bit like a drug ; it forces the government to spend money and spending on migration like spending money on drugs makes the economy feel good and look good…. short term. But long term it has to stop often as a result of some kind of paralysis caused by the simple unaffordability of the model.\nHousing inflation feels good to those with houses but locks people out of the housing market; both as tenants and owner occupiers. Migration probably creates the largest push factor on housing (along with divorce) particularly inner city housing; driving up rent values and creating an out of town demand for “new build”. So Brexit might reduce the pressure on housing and the loss of government spending and a reduction in housing inflation will translate into a slowing economy. However long term this is sustainable and is indeed beneficial. The same goes for the devaluation of the pound. We are once again getting a sense of the British economy based on real economics not the distorting filter of Euronomics!\nWage levels are in the short term going to be driven to the minimum wage by continuing immigration. Restrict migration to only those economic elites we need in the economy (as opposed to political elites that we need fewer of) and we will probably see wages rising at the lower wage levels. Wage levels being stagnant isn’t due to Brexit it is because we remain within the EU. Out of the EU and with a global approach to recruiting the brightest and best, our economy will benefit from global talent at the top whilst our flexible private housing market and welfare reform deliver British workers to British working class jobs at the delivery end of the economy.\nWhy would Blair and co want to avoid this obvious good news story? Well as part of the EU elite Blair and co have a perverse attachment to a government model that offers people like them (and their families) well paid but essentially pointless jobs managing the people of a continent. The people of the EU are getting wise to the fact that these elite Euro jobs are largely irrelevant whilst working class jobs are under threat from migration and over regulation. But more importantly their taxes and debt pay for a system that looks sustainable in the short term but that will eventually collapse taking them down whilst the elite takes their “earnings” paid by workers taxes and move to Dubi or similar.\nIf Blair and Co loved Britain as much as they loved Brussels they would applaud Brexit and the life-affirming opportunities it gives Britain to escape the debt-burdened incoherence of the EU. Leaving the EU (hard or soft) will help other nations develop a sustainable economy that through trade brings the chance of greater peace across the planet. It will help Britain recover from the consequences of its numerous recessions and help it begin to repay its indebtedness. Free trade is the DNA of European and world peace but regrettably for Britain and us at a Blue Revolution the EU seem intent on preventing Britain from having free trade within the EU customs area. Denial of free trade is a serious weapon the EU and their elites want to use against Britain. Blair and Co working in our interests? No, as usual, just their own!\n28.11.16 The trouble for girls is clear and simple; it’s the amoral free market stoopid!\nIs the western world a safe place for girls? It seems such an unnecessary question given that in Iran a girl can’t sing in public and in Saudi Arabia being female is almost a crime. We don’t need to look at Egypt or Somalia to register that in these countries being female is a risk to your reproductive health. So in the West, we would assume girls have never had it so good.\nThe West’s progress has ensured that the laws on marriage allow easy divorce, that girls can have jobs in every field of work, that the horror of pregnancy outside of marriage is mitigated by welfare and there is abortion on demand. With the consequences of this package of 20th-century reforms, girls should have a bright and aspirational future. However, the general opinion seems to be; girls in the West are unhappy and this is reflected in low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide.\nA recent British documentary highlighted the challenges for an Afghan girl as she fought to avoid being sold as a bride (to provide money for her brother) and her fight to be free to achieve her musical ambitions. She was throughout very philosophical; even when told by her grandmother she could be sold to an eighty-year-old. As a young Western girl, you might conclude OMG!\nHowever, OMG hardly captures the reality. Too many western girls behave with a level of self-loathing that would be understandable if they were being sold to an eighty-year-old. But why? Well we believe that girls in the West have lost part of one gender identity as full-time mothers and gained another partial identity as workers whilst being sold two myths; one is that the “free market” delivers happiness via mass consumption and that the tendency to objectify themselves and therefore others is due to them personally rather than a process encouraged by the free market to maximise consumption. This latter point is reflected in attempts to get girls to “get real” about themselves. The girls need to “get real” about the “free market”!!\nThe free market is a means of making money. Unlike in the past when making money was about creating jobs today the jobs are in China or India. This has elevated consumption above production as the main economic preoccupation. Consumption doesn’t require a working class it simply requires consumers and a means of creating enough wealth to provide the means of consumption (as opposed to the means of production). This wealth can be engineered by governments in the form of welfare spending or it can be “liberated” from increased asset values like house price increases. Whilst men and women are cast in the role of consumer (consumer having replaced subject or citizen) it seems to us that being a woman has added complication in that personal consumption can be increased by dint of one’s attractiveness or ability to be relaxed about getting pregnant whilst dependent upon state benefits.\nIn the past the two roles women could take advantage of were separated by marriage. Worker prior to marriage and mother thereafter. Today they are blended but the blending is simply intended to maximise the woman’s consumer capacity, so loyalty to others disappears for them as well as for men. For both males and females being with the rich man and marrying the beautiful woman is the corrosive aspiration downloaded into everyone at birth. In the case of men low wages exclude them from the mass consumer club, for women, average looks have the same effect. (an attractive woman can “trade up”) For both, debt can, in the short-term increase ones “consumption coefficient” but for women, the conflict between the two roles is mediated if not indeed manipulated by government policy, in particular, welfare. The problem for girls is that being conflicted around serious life choices is dispiriting, depressing and confusing and eventually it is too easy to default to having children; wanted or not!! thereby opting out of the world of work or being compromised with a work life balance that puts work before children.\nFinally, for too many men the alternative to being successful is suicide; physically removing themselves from the gene pool….often having sired a couple of children. The most recent figure show that suicide is the highest cause of death for men between twenty and thirty-four. For others, crime is another “alternative” career that creates a consumer capability.\nThe free market is not wholly a force for good it has the capacity to corrupt and distort peoples expectations, turning love, loyalty and duty into different forms of greed. The public feel this on both sides of the Atlantic but possibly don’t understand where the feeling comes from. However, the “free market” loving political elite neither feel nor understand the problems with this inhuman and corroding system and are therefore shocked when the public reject them because they won’t reform, modify or control this system.\n02.12.16 The Blue Revolution has some challenges which the “liberal elite” might find uncomfortable. Let us examine one!\nThe experts have just concluded that advice and education is a waste of time when it comes to controlling alcohol misuse and pricing policy is more effective. In this world of “rational expectations” does this help us to understand how best to create a nonreligious morality fit for the 21st century?\nSince the turn of the 20th century, there has been a slow relentless decline in moral behaviour. It has been met by an ever expanding system of welfare that the public sector elites view quite wrongly as “progressive”. How such a word can be used to justify a policy which undermines moral choices is hard to comprehend. Here at a Blue Revolution, we believe in Contract, Choice, and Consent and take the view that adults should be capable of navigating their lives within this moral framework with some limited scope for state support in the short term as necessary for individuals who fall on hard times. However with a western society grown fat and lazy on welfare and state largess something needs to be done to re-engineer society back to a place where adults are fully competent moral agents and not the beneficiaries of an undermining culture of state money and a sanctimonious moral relativism. The contract, Choice, and Consent should be all that is required to underpin a truly moral society. We are going to look at Contract, Choice, and Consent in relation to procreation.\nAt the time of the birth of Britain’s welfare state, society was moral to the point where too many personal choices were deemed immoral and in some cases like homosexuality illegal. This was both a dark age and an age of peculiar enlightenment. Christianity left a legacy of marriage by consent and those mature enough to understand the awesome obligations associated with marriage went on to provide loving stable and productive homes for themselves and their children. The element of choice and consent is there and the marriage ceremony itself is an “illiterates contract”. The persecution of gays and lesbians was and remains immoral. A person sexuality has no relevance to their social or economic productivity.\nUnfortunately, society changed, in some ways for the better but not in all ways. Something commonplace during the war but which lay dormant after the war began to filter into society and that was “sexual abandon”, a bi-product of war which became “sexual liberation” in the 1960’s. Sexual liberation was heralded by the “shagging” community as a way of marking themselves out from the more buttoned up or as they would argue repressed community. The sex scandals of the present age have their origins in this “sexual liberation”. It was and still is a predators charter.\nSexual liberation is bad enough when the consequences are hurt feelings, personal disgust, and divorce, but it significantly worse when a child is produced either because of “sexual liberation” or a child is caught in the middle of “sexually liberated parent(s).\nSo having exposed what we consider to be the problem; what do we see as the solution? Well, it can’t be more of the same, state money to subsidise wanton stupidity. No, if we have to consider the financial consequences of millions of selfish “liberated” life choices we might take the view that this liberation has to stop. to avoid behaving like some prig or moral dinosaur such as we find in dust bowl Islamic societies like Saudi Arabia we need to protect individual choices and respect an adult’s moral agency. Contract, Choice and Consent does this. But what of those who fail to behave like adults, the children of the age of sexual liberation for whom Contract, Choice and Consent are irrelevant concepts.\nWell, this is where we at a Blue Revolution become a little more draconian; because a society based on Contract Choice and Consent has to have a way of encouraging compliance with responsible behaviour and disincentivize morally poor behaviour. This is done by having a national policy of DNA registration. A pregnancy is no longer an act of one sided selfishness with the more vulnerable gender picking up the moral pieces and the social disapproval. The process should be based on consent and choice and a contract between the parents to support the child. In the absence of this being negotiated by free mature moral agents, the state should step in and force the parents, confirmed via DNA to support their offspring. If education doesn’t work for alcohol misuse why would we assume it would work for reckless procreation.\nThe “liberal elite” will argue that registering DNA is an infringement of human rights. That is because there is money to be made from the social and moral chaos upon which the state thrives. However just as all our rights are now contingent on fair play to all of us taxpayers, particularly now that the wealthy corporations have decided that tax avoidance is a moral imperative, knowing who has sired whom and therefore who should pay is essential to help re-motivate people towards improved moral behaviour. We would argue that this change will be a bitter pill for the underclass to swallow, but it will we guarantee….note guarantee, improve the lives and expectations of boys and girls, put promiscuity into retreat and place children as the pinnacle of a safe and coherent union between parents who have thought about children ahead of a promiscuous lifestyle. No punishing the fornicators, no sex education explaining what to do with your “farm parts” just a lesson in contract choice and consent and the consequences of having unprotected sex on your bank balance and future happiness and prosperity. Here at Blue Revolution, we consider that as sexual intercourse releases powerful hormones it is a bit like a drug. So let’s tackle its worst social aspects in the manner of substance misuse. Let’s treat it like a dangerous substance!\n04.12.16 What is wrong with “Remainers”? Their love of the State doesn’t stop with the EU that’s what!\nThe Lib Dems are claiming to have made a come back with electoral success based they say on a campaign which was largely anti Brexit. It is not clear to us why the sort of people who live in Richmond would be 70% in favour of “remain”. However, there are other “affluent” constituencies which also have a similar profile so perhaps it is about being affluent. Here at a Blue Revolution, we are well enough educated, and global in outlook but not affluent so unlike the affluent we can’t accept the idea of an expensive government over running our lives or accept the idea of rule by superstate.\nIn the twenty-first century, the superstate is essentially an arrangement which sees the little bit of non-debt backed value created by workers being consumed by the state, for the ultimate benefit of the state. The welfare, health and human rights industries to name but three are basically the use of ordinary people’s lives and tax revenues to justify extraordinary wages for the states army of workers. Perhaps Richmond is full of well-paid state workers (£100K+) and bankers who either don’t have to worry about business profitability as they are Civil Servants or think that flogging debt to almost bankrupt European’s contributes to sustainable long-term progress.\nThe problem these affluent people face is their inability to accept there is a democratic deficit in staying in the EU. Whilst getting out might look complicated…. the problem is no one gave the tax paying public the option of opting into the superstate, it was a choice made for us by the elite. So now with all the soft fascism the elite can muster (even in the UK’s Private Eye and the Lib Dems pro-EU posturing amongst others) we need to resist the elites continued pleading for us to stick with their grand plan. We also need to resist the ideas of a left alliance of Greens and the Lib Dems who think Labour will help them salvage what for Brexiteers is the nightmare of remaining. This as we said, is a scenario that the public didn’t vote for and did actually vote against.\nIn reality and with the power of technology the State needs to wither away (a bit….or a lot ) but holding on to control and power runs against the interests of the ordinary people who want less of the State and its cost, not more. With idiots like the putative left alliance having a tantrum all over the place about everything, the prospect of the state continuing to strut it’s wholly tax gobbling and all too often self-serving and pointless stuff, is certain. Brexit starts the process of change.\n07.12.16 We are the people, the people are not the State. The State should be the servant of the people but with an elite in charge the State is our master!\nWe have commented on the relationship between the people and the State in various posts over the last few months and particularly as we worked our way towards Brexit. Concepts like “vested interests” “the establishment” only have meaning when the State and the people do not share common values. We believe that under the economic system that was known as Capitalism the State operated in the interests of the Capitalist class. Upholding “capitalist values”. These reinforced inequality in wages and flowing from that limited the rights of the workers to enjoy the full freedoms afforded by Contract, Choice and Consent. This went as far as creating a lifestyle limited environment of poor health, ignorance and low expectations.\nThe post-war era accelerated the process of turning the capitalist system around. it achieved this by putting the State centre stage, no longer operating on behalf of the vested interests of the Capitalist system which many viewed as the cause of World War II. Post war the State became the operator of big businesses, welfare protected the workers and the Grammar Schools elevated the children of “workers” into the establishment. It was like the children’s books of the day presented it; a rosy era for the working class. Those of us who remember this period remember a time when people were generally happy responsible and the state seemed to work for the people.\nThe post-war period was not all good news, however. “The People” were all too often represented by a labour movement hell bent on destroying a system that had really ceased to exist in the west BY THE 1970’S. British firms were being turned into commissioning bodies manufacturing abroad. The horror of the capitalist system was now largely inflicted on the proletariat of China, Korea, Vietnam etc. The left wing put the final nails in the coffin of what remained of the British manufacturing and extractive industries because of their blinkered ideological ignorance they viewed “Industry” as capitalist, so it was necessary to destroy industry and the jobs that went with it.\nThe challenge is this; what do you do when your capitalist system is collapsing around your ears. When not- withstanding its many flaws it no longer delivers the value and wealth necessary to support consumption by an increasingly entitled population. Well, you recognise that “globalisation” has a different way of delivering wealth and you try and game it to your advantage. This is what the people see as the problem with the current system. It is also why the traditional “left” have no answers. The state manages wealth and much of this wealth is generated by the debt and tax of workers. Unable to countenance any suggestion of a return to “capitalism” the left just promotes the same Tax and spend model to maintain demand and consumer satisfaction.\nThe problem is that by replacing vast swathes of the economy (if you don’t believe this take any British county or city and work out how many people work for its biggest employers; the NHS, Schools, County and District councils plus the odd prison or MOD Base etc) the government is trapped into maintaining itself first and foremost, and then it looks to supporting the rest of the economic system. This is the mechanism by which the state becomes the master of the people. Protecting the States interests is the main purpose of the state and its army of pointless 100K+ “Senior Leaders”. The people get in the way of this “nice little earner” hence the hissy fits from Statists like Britains Nick Clegg and an assortment of the State elites in parliaments (EU, Westminster, Scottish, Welsh, NI Assembly) and their supporting administrations; “Civil Servants” and Courts.\nSo what is the solution? Well to coin a phrase the workers need to raise their consciousness. Not like some long haired student Marxist bamboozled by the complex nature of Marxism who believes that the State is the answer to the inequalities of the world, but by realising that the State keeps a lot of people on great salaries doing very little that matters to ordinary people and these State people are the elite who work the system to their long-term advantage. A sort of perpetuating of disadvantage by pretending or virtue signalling that they are doing the opposite.\nThe modern economy has so much government in it that it can be easily characterised as a system operated by the State that takes workers debt and tax and turns it into salaries for its self-selecting elite. People like Nick Clegg, Keir Starmer, the Kinnocks, Blairs, the Judges of the higher courts and an army of people who do stuff in our name but not with our consent!!\n07.12 16 An Industrial strategy needs a policy on debt and pensions. These are yesterday’s challenge tomorrow!\nAn industrial strategy needs to cover a number of issues in the now globalised world. We think that dwarfing energy prices and other global uncertainties are the problems of debt and pensions. How did we get here? The modern free market is not capitalism. Capitalism requires the accumulation of capital. This was appropriated from workers in the form of the profits made by underpaying the workers. In a capitalist system, this capital became the basis for future investment, economic growth and of course future exploitation of workers.\nAs we argue the capitalist system had its faults but it was the progenitor of what we now have come to recognise as the modern world. It reflected the troika of Contract, Choice and Consent which underpins freedom and democracy and it demanded of those subject to its discipline a responsible way of life that required people to take care of themselves and their families and to have regard for their communities. They had to work out how to manage the wages borne of the exploitation by the capitalist. With the combination of Contract, Choice and Consent and the responsible worker looking to protect their families the fundamental building blocks of freedom and democracy became well established by the 1930’s. They endured the war and after the war, the government looked at the exploitation of an exhausted nation and intervened. They intervened to rebuild the economy and to minimise the levels of the wage exploitation by capitalists. The government never assumed that the qualities self-discipline hard wired into people by the capitalist system would not endure with a more interventionist government programme. They assumed that with welfare and pensions, health and education the future for working people was bright. It was until the beginning of the 1960’s.\nIn the 1960’s the capitalist system largely morphed into the modern free market. This is an immoral system. It has no context of responsible behaviour underpinning it. It encourages irresponsible social and economic behaviour. The post-war legacy of welfare became the means by which the free market managed to rid itself of any responsibility for the social and economic decline of the nation whilst relying on the welfare system to maintain wages and pensions. Sending work abroad and bringing migrants here allows the price of labour to decline whilst sending the manufacturing industry abroad allows free market profits to remain high. Paying for it all with debt and taxation allows consumer demand to be kept up benefitting the svengalis of the free market, people like Sir Philip Green. This is an almighty mess!\nPensions in the public sector, health care costs and a whole host of other inflating expenditures is bringing the national finances under unbearable strain. We need to start making a profit as a nation and relying on the “free market” with its urge to make money at the taxpayer’s expense really is not going to make Britain a leading industrial nation.\n10.12.16 The elite and their experts are still intent on confusing the public about the reality of Brexit and the “old world order”. But why? We look to the Uk for answers.\nIn the UK it is claimed Brexit means Brexit. Well that is like saying Justice means Justice; it means very little but unintentionally for Mrs May it sends a mixed message to those voters who Mr and Mrs Clegg and their NBF’s, the Blairs, Keir Starmer et al view as too stupid to understand the complex issues associated with the UK departing the EU; namely most of the British people both Brexiteers and Remainers.\nThe elites look down on the British people in a way that was inconceivable in the past; this is whether the people agree with them or not. Is it amongst other things our ability to load our sentences with actual often difficult meaning rather than speak articulately and yet simultaneously say nothing? it is our ability to live lives with none of the “status” craved by D-list “Slebs” and the elite in the places that warehouse them like the Big Brother House, BBC, EU and Westminster? or is it even more elemental?\nThe reason for their disdain, and if you don’t know what we mean watch Emily Thornberry MP, is the fact that we are no longer essential “factors of production” within the British economy. Factors of production that have to be “heard”, respected and won over to maintain capitalism’s promise of creating social and economic value and tax revenue for the State. We “the people” are now just a means by which the government can manipulate the economy to maintain aggregate demand through tax, debt and welfare and thus secure for a little longer the free market merry-go-round that keeps them in their positions of rank and privilege and allows some people who game the system to get rich. This maintains the pretence that the economic system is “just” and laden with opportunity for all. The modern Economic System delivers little by way of social and economic “justice”. We call it “secular wWesternism” as it delivers unhappiness, misery and destruction of the planet (no not the myth of solely man-made global warming stoopid) on an industrial scale.\nAs usual with a Blue Revolution, there is a lot in the above. Let us identify some examples. Global warming is the global issue most promoted by the elite. It helps to take the public’s eye of the “secular western” ball. The problem with the world economy is that with debt as the basis for economic prosperity there needs to be a ravenous “growth” to repay debt, replenish pensions and maintain stock and property prices. This requires an attack on our beloved planet like no other, over-population, deforestation and the volume of extraction, pollution and species annihilation, and yet whilst the elite talk of progress i.e. economic success reducing poverty and global conflict etc, we say yes, but at what price! Can it be done in a more planet-friendly way?\nTo tackle this head on the “elites” would need to scale back their own activities and recalibrate the world economy to something more sustainable and for them scary too; something measurable and achievable, co-operation and non-conflict based. Unwilling to change the nature of the western hegemony they promote “man-made global warming”; and Kyoto, the secular western elite’s impotent proxy for actually doing something to save the planet. Oh and the so called “Greens” buy into this rot too, along with the “storm troopers” of the elite……the academic “expert”.\nTo save the planet we would need to cut the birth rate through women’s education and employment, restrain the gender obsessions upon which too much of the free market is built and which across all demographics promotes reckless single parenthood. We must establish some global and universal values; we offer contract, choice and consent and we must stop the free market merry-go-round of “growth at all costs” and then more growth. This means moving away from a debt based economic model with the state as ringmaster to one based on achieving high levels of non-debt-based social and economic value by for example opening up Africa to agri-trade whilst restraining population movements by encouraging sustainable, non-growth obsessed economies in countries that currently export people rather than productivity.\nOn the Uk domestic front, the elites won’t tell you that the British economy is so dependent on migration that it actually needs “free movement of people” i.e. the movement to the UK of whole families. We have argued that “free movement of workers” is “just” and fair. However, it is unlikely to deliver the crippling levels of migration that the state needs to inflate the housing, property, stock and welfare markets which just so happen to contribute to the UK’s economic “growth”.\nThere is growth out there Jim but not as we know it, and as Brexit showed, not as we like it.\nApols to “The Firm”.\nAll Faiths Page 3\n21.10.16 The political elite and their hangers on plus the underclass; two groups who are well beyond their sell by date.\nIf observing mankind’s evolution from the swamp to highly evolved but immoral and indebted teaches us anything it is that at almost every step of the way one small group is exploiting a much larger one. Whether it is the unacknowledged exploitation of women by men in tribal culture or a feudal system furnished with value by serfs or slaves history to date teaches us that we are only slowly falteringly or in Donald Trump’s case groping our way towards more enlightened times. The enlightenment is within eye and earshot but still not achievable yet. But Why?\nAs economic determinists, we believe that to fully realise a progressive evolutionary shift we need to understand where exploitation lays in the current economic system. We have, we hope explained that there are groups of influential people out there happily manufacturing industries that allow them to line their own pockets with government cash much of this government cash is debt based and paid for by the worker. The most significant of these groups are the ambulance chasing lawyers pursuing minor public sector and health workers plus soldiers for “compensation”. Alleged wrongdoing is the context for litigation. The compensation is the self-justifying pretext for court action but the much more important subtext are the legal costs!\nThe law-makers being lawyers is a breach of the separation of powers but one that the lawyers, that generally quite process observant group are quite happy to overlook. There is also the fact that the law is expected to pay well so lawmakers are paid well too. Lawyer as policy and lawmakers is one reason that the interests of blue collar workers have been overlooked for too long. Our needs are secondary to the needs of the State to protect its officers, members, and hangers-on and keep the whole process hidden by a veil of legal legitimacy . This explains the left alliances (Greens, Lib Dems and Labour Party in the UK’s obsession with staying in the EU). It is only very remotely about trade it is really about maintaining the EU political system for the benefit of the Junkers and Tusks and the UK’s “left-wing” hangers on and duff politicians . For their “class” to survive the EU has to survive. This makes what the UK did in voting out as cutting edge revolutionary as anywhere in the word for many, many decades; possibly even centuries. Well done. The Blue Collar revolution starts from here. The three millennia of rule by one elite after another will start to change from here on in.\nHowever, there is one element of UK domestic policy which we believe is exploitative and which also supports the State’s overall aim of maintaining control for its elites which justifies well-paid state employment at the highest level. And that is the subsidisation and growth of the underclass. This shameless bit of social engineering has cast millions of lives into a mire of hopelessness resulting for males in drug, alcohol and crime and women into premature motherhood before that are emotionally equipped to look after themselves let alone a small defenceless child. The advantage of this horribly broken system is that it allows the left wing parties to talk the language of caring whilst promoting a system which keeps workers paying and the state receiving and the underclass locked into a moral and economic “double lock” that allows them little chance of escape. The underclass feeds the State monster, directly through the need to manage them via government jobs and government departments such as the Justice department and indirectly by encouraging workers from abroad to migrate to do low skilled work, thus pleasing the EU overlords. Migration puts pressure on the housing market so housebuilders do Ok as does the Government via taxes on building and sale.\nWe believe the Blue Collar revolution, the proper worker’s revolution needs to tackle the problem of the exploitation of the worker’s root (the underclass) and branch (the elite)\n23.10.16 Contract, Choice and Consent; a Blue Revolution’s global “trideology” for the rest of the 21st and the 22nd century and beyond.\nThe “ideology” of the EU and we have recently concluded the “ideology” of “New Labour” (RIP) are similar in one specific respect; they are both premised on the belief that social justice can be delivered by a theological or ideological “socialist” state. Free movement of people, whole swathes of people, the very young, the very old and the disabled moved around the continent to access better welfare, education and health all on the “ticket” of often a single “worker”. This is the inception of the dream of the EU social and economic engineers; a continent united in one single belief system and one single market. However it is about 200 years too premature and on this basis, it will break before it can be made to work. The analogy we would use is that the EU theologians are trying to transplant an old established Oak tree rather than cultivate a sapling and take their time over it. They are killing the tree.\nThere are lots wrong with the EU….its currency trapping weak economies into an unsustainable economic model, the free movement of people stoking up resentment for reasons obvious to anyone other than the elite. The over inflation of economies within the Customs Area of the EU luring the illiterate and the morally immature from North Africa. The consequences of “hubristic humanitarianism” on vulnerable EU communities and women.\nSo what is to be done. Well, we believe that to unite the world to encourage growth, trade and reduce the risk of war we need to promote a set of ideas that have obvious moral appeal and to a wide and culturally diverse world, and hence we have distilled “Marxism” and produced a spirit of freedom captured in Contract, Choice and Consent, our “trideology”. These three rights are drawn from Capitalism and are a legacy of that economic model conferring rights that under feudalism were denied to too many people……in fact denied to all peoples.\nThe EU needs to realise that its policy of self-promotion is denying countries that need to develop a modern morality the opportunity to do so it is doing this by discouraging the cleansing of relationships associated with free trade. The EU is not a safe pair of hands and neither is the rest of the self-regarding and the self-promoted western world…and that includes the ideological “left” who see wealth rather than rights as the main objective of their “socialism”. Grow up guys!\n28.10.16 Saint Tone, a Patron Saint of the EU theocracy offers us advice on Brexit. He like they simply don’t get it!\nThe theocrats of the EU have dispatched one of their big guns to patronise and plead on behalf of the EU elite. On the UK’s BBC radio 4 morning show, Tony Blair dished up the usual meal of warmed up “third-way” leftovers and a defence of the EU status quo which confirmed the self-regarding, paranoid and delusional view of economics, politics and society that characterises much of the Remain side of debate.\nClearly, the British people didn’t know what they were doing in voting for Brexit and don’t know what they are doing in continuing to support Brexit. The implications are that much misery will befall them and they will have to rely on their elites to sort out the ensuing Brexit mess. It could not occur to Blair because he is incapable of self-criticism that the politically mature and independently minded British might be prepared to endure short-term problems in some economic areas such as lower house prices and increased inflation as a bi-product of gaining proper democratic accountability and a reduction in the power of the technocrats and the elite. Of course, it is arguable that much of what is going on in the economy is simply a correction ofter years of EU economic engineering. The British economy needs to start living in the real world; the world of risk, value, price and profit and loss. It needs to leave the safe haven of the Alice in Wonderland economics of Tusk, Junker, Schultz…..oh and Blair. This is a world where the Elite game the economy to meet the economic, political and sociological needs of the elite themselves and use the economic levers of mass migration, Quantitative Easing and low-interest rates to create artificial short term “confidence” and thereby maintain aggregate demand across a range of EU strategic sectors. Of course, the beneficiaries of this “economic model” are the elite who fob the masses off with cheap debt and a morally ambiguous liberal social policy. All of this combines to create a long-term toxic blend of expectations and entitlements that the European economy can only hope to deliver in the short to medium term and will fail to deliver in the long term. They will fail because society will falter with too little collective social responsibility and economies will buckle under the strain of debt, ageing populations, mass migration and an absence of proper global competition keeping business sharp.\nWhat Blair et don’t understand because they are beneficiaries of the existing system is that economic value and progressive social values are longer being delivered by Western leaders in the western world. The British public have grasped this ahead of the rest of the EU and are the first to demand something is done about it; Brexit!\n29.10.16 If it were not for the ability to store value or transform debt into wealth would we be able to reveal and then solve the “puzzle of history”!\nIt was Karl Marx who said: “communism is the puzzle of history solved”. However, we have had almost one hundred years to become familiar with “communism” and it really hasn’t “solved”anything. The same goes for “socialism”; grand theories that eventually draw power to the state and thereby undermine society and an individual’s ability to fulfil their “species-essence”. So if everyone from Lenin to Corbyn has got it wrong what does “getting it right” look like. We consider whether the real workers Blue revolution solves history’s final puzzle, thereby bringing about the fabled “End of History”.\nWell firstly whether it is Communism or Socialism the actual application of the principles of both have been poorly interpreted. In the case of “socialism”, the State has shown a great reluctance to diminish its power and control and indeed under Blair in the UK and others around the world “the State” and its army of technocrats has grown as the power of western Capitalism has diminished. With Capitalism now unable to generate sufficient value to feed the workers the arms and legs of the state have stepped in to manage the operating environment of whatever bits of the productive and job-creating economy still remain active in the west. This is essentially managing the environment of the “free market” and ensuring that the real liquidity of the free market namely “confidence” is maintained. This has differed within the various parts of “the west”, but we would claim it is fair to say that the EU’s expansion was a stitch up by socialist technocrats intended to mitigate the effects of capitalism’s drift to cheaper areas of the world, and to ensure they and their class had a job for life. We call these people the “publicsectocracy”; they are the aristocracy of the “socialist system”.\nHas this socialist experiment of state management of the economic environment worked? Well, we would say yes and no. A state takes a lot of money to manage an economy and maintain the politics and social policy which rests upon it. In the UK there has been a programme of social policies since the end of WWII which could be described as progressive and the welfare state; a 19th-century idea now bloated and malfunctioning, was great in its time. Brexit proves however that overall model fails the public’s “sniff test”. Too much debt, too many pointless ” infrastructure projects”, too much immigration to fill up the city centres whilst the indigenous populations flee to the newly built out of town estates, family collapse and re-configuration driving housing demand along with the growing realisation that a worker’s right to a home will play second fiddle to the housing industry, lawyers and government, a government like all governments that needs tax revenue. Immigration, gaming the housing market in favour of builders, and the demand from family breakdown, all justifies what we call the mythology of the manufactured housing shortage. As if all that were not enough there is a moral decline as the free market “marketises” everything base including genitalia and sexual behaviour. What used to titillate older men, sooth the lonely and make schoolboys snigger is now part of the mainstream economy; it has to be, there isn’t as much of a real “value creating” economy left!\nSo overall, socialism has, like the political elite and the underclass it’s two great demographic creations, been around too long. Its army of highly paid functionaries and lawyers has become like the aristocrats of the old feudal system, unwilling or unable to see how they stand in the way of progress. So what of Communism?\nCommunism has never existed anywhere on the planet. The revolutions of the past were industrial revolutions orchestrated by the state which gave rise to rapid increases in the value the economy could create and thus gave a legitimacy to the claim higher living standards were due to “communism” as people became better off. This increase in value based wealth happened in the west under actual Capitalism. Some “Communist” or rather state capitalist societies like post-revolutionary Russia have finally settled back to become more “socialist” in character, rather more along western lines. This seems to us to be because socialism was or is what “communism” in Russia really was namely State control of the economic environment rather than by for and of the people! So in terms of solving the riddle of history, hmmm mmmm. More work to do.\n02.11.16 Trump and the White House yes or no? We endorse diversity so why shouldn’t a man with a personality disorder become President.\nAs revolutionaries, we accept that whilst revolutions in the 21st century should not be blood letting they might be gut wrenching. And so it will be with a Trump Presidency. Trump is clearly a man with one if not two personality disorders the most obvious being narcissism but with a bit of borderline thrown in too and perhaps some……..no we will stick to two. Anyway, we were debating Trump the other day and discussing the aftermath of a Trump win. It was suggested that the CIA might do him in, which whilst always possible in trigger-happy America seems unlikely.\nThe man is a revolutionary in that he has persuaded the sad, delusional and ill-informed that he stands up for them. Corbyn says the same thing in the United Kingdom and has attracted a similar constituency. However, whereas Corbyn’s natural supporters are the neurotic waifs and strays of the democratic process, Trump’s people are the gun toting and paranoid. His people hate the establishment, code word for the Clintons, as much as they fear the lawless underclass. They are sad and emotionally abandoned people though just like the lawless underclass they fear so much. As true apostles of the principles of diversity we at a Blue Revolution, however, fear no one including a President Trump; gut-wrenching as that prospect might be. Even a man with his obvious emotional shortcomings can be president in the 21st century; the US constitution almost shouts that at you as you pop out of the womb on US soil. But why do we think this way?\nWell Trump’s election as President will lead to a whole lot of soul searching as the US considers the implications of electing such an odd character to the highest office in the land, and what such a result will say to the world about the brash, money obsessed and shallow state of the American electorate as engineered, just like the UK’s not quite so lawless underclass, by a greedy and self-interested political elite. But that elite is the alternative.\nWe only had one word of caution about the election of President Trump and that was he has executive control of the codes to launch a nuclear attack. Apparently, these codes can be deployed without challenge by special advisers or military chiefs being used at the President’s discretion, causing a nuclear conflagration in fifteen minuted (four minutes to launch!).\nHowever as we have concluded that in a just world even someone as mad as Trump can be President, it doesn’t mean his special needs don’t deserve some special treatment. Therefore we recommend the appointment of the Presidential psychiatric team, who can quickly step in and deal with the US’s first President with “Special needs” and section him if required. Thus avoiding WWIII becomes a matter of his capacity for office rather than the failings of the US constitution. As our old friend Karl Marx said: “from each according to his ability to each according to his special needs”. With that proviso, we Blue Revolutionaries give a cautious thumbs up to President Trump.\nWith apologies to Karl Marx.\n03.11.16 Sharia courts in the UK! Is this really a problem? We consider the issue.\nSharia courts in the UK are accused of discriminating against women. Well, we consider the issue. Imagine a type of world where a person took responsibility for the decisions they make and were held to account. One might conclude that this is like the contract based western world where you agree to any arrangements you subject yourself to be it an employment contract or a personal loan. However when money is involved the T’s and C’s are usually rigidly enforced not so when the issue is about relationships. In the context of relationships, family life or the mundane humdrum stuff there is no direction or guidance in the west just a government willing to pick up the tab for people’s mistakes. People marry and divorce having children they can’t afford, conduct illicit relationships out of narcissism or a desire to hurt a no longer desired partner. A Sharia court only discriminates against people who have made informed decisions they now want to change. The critical question is; was the decision they made to start with, based on Contract, Choice and Consent?\nWell, the answer to this is quite simple. If the issue that is taken to the Sharia court was entered into willingly and there is no suggestion of abuse or coercion then the matter of the Sharia court is one of ensuring that people behave responsibly. We could do with a kind of Sharia court within the secular western world so we can start to tackle the blight of the irresponsible underclass.\n05.11.16 Uk’s High Court interferes with “Brexit”. The strategic wing of the publicsectocracy opens up the battlefield for the disrupting tactics of the “Remoaners”. Is this how the establishment works?\nA Government Minister resigns and oh he is a lawyer. The High Court whilst resisting the urge to comment on “Brexit” none the less make it utterly problematic to negotiate without the interference of MP’s many of whom are pro remain and lawyers. Add to that the “yesterday’s men and women” in the House of Lords and you can see the UK has a major “democratic deficit”. The Lawyer who resigned did so we imagine so he could throw the full weight of his “Publicsectocratic” mind behind the Remain campaign in Parliament. Of course with a full battalion of Political lawyers the battle to frustrate Brexit will be much easier than winning the public over to the cause of remaining in the EU with its bloated army of technocrats and wafflers.\nWe said it here that the Establishment are largely comprised of politicised lawyers. It seems that we were more right on that that the evidence at the time suggested; we have some more compelling evidence now. The separation of powers, undermined by Blair and his army of subversive lawyers still holds the nation to ransom. And we can see where the counter-revolutionaries are on all sides of the House of Commons. Democracy in crisis: “hell yeah” the country is run by lawyers, not politicians!\n07.11.16 What happens when a “virtuous circle” consisting of establishment action to tackle the effects of economic decline goes wrong. You the workers pay to keep them in well paid work!\nThe trouble with the State getting too involved in things is that its chief box-wallahs find it difficult to put aside the levers of the state when the economy, perhaps due to an over-zealous enthusiasm to intervene fails to help the economy. They believe their intervention helps because it might have helped once when there was a less globalised operating environment for the world’s economies and you could spend value in a largely closed society and could feed your population internally. However, since then the world has opened up and jobs have gone elsewhere and people move about. There is still more of the world to open up too so things could only get worse for the blue collar workers. Unless dear revolutionaries we do something very creative.\nFirstly we need to look at what the “establishment” is up to. They are creating a State that provides the well-remunerated government and legal establishment employment that they and their “enlightened” and entitled class feel they deserve. The colonisation of the legislature by the legal establishment is part of this process. Knowing little about the people in the Blue Collar demographic the legal establishment and politicians of a certain stripe warmly virtue signal themselves by wrapping the idle and promiscuous in a welfare system that keeps them in ignorance, poverty, both spiritual and material, and idleness. It requires the actual grafters to pay for this and then pay for the army of well-paid box-wallahs who extract tax to pay for this wasteful system and of course, their 100k salaries too.\nWhat happens in this situation is that the workers become the victims of the “virtuous” State and we end up with the workers paying for a system that promotes the very values the workers detest but which critically keeps the establishment in work. The outcome at this elementary stage in the revolution is Brexit and possibly Trump. In the UK Theresa May may slowly let the steam out of the blue collar pressure cooker and get us out of the clutches of the rich tax gobbling and entitled EU waffler. If this doesn’t happen then things can only get a little tense and a Blue Revolution may be superseded by a more bloody red one.\nSo what is the answer; well why not make training Britain’s young in proper practical skills easier for the talented tradesman and women of the UK, whilst making it less attractive to employ “off the shelf” workers from Eastern Europe. This doesn’t have to be abusive, simply a shift in focus away from bogus degrees and the student debt that supports “lefty” academics. We only have about a decade left to do this because we still have talented and skilled people left to do the training. This approach will embed workers values rather than the values which demand that the tax payers job is to support the “left” elite.\nSecondly and more importantly open up Britain to the intellectual talent of the Indian sub-Continent and beyond as we hope Mrs May is trying to do. So rather than replace young trainee brickies with Eastern European brickies we can replace the overpaid and entitled elite with a more modest cleverer and moral group of intellectuals from elsewhere in the English-speaking world…..Come on let’s give the establishment elite a taste of their own medicine, at least until Grammar schools deliver our own competitive working class elite. Let’s replace some of our public School elite with skilled and talented migrants. What’s good for Britain is good for the world! It’s been like that since the 18th century!\n09.11.16 Well well Trump won. No real surprise there we supported him too! But to avoid a real mess he has to deliver. We offer some advice!\nThe Trump challenge is to deliver to the constituency of the white working and middle classes who feel that the last three decades have been about undermining their economic status by exporting their jobs; then expecting them to burden themselves with debt to keep each other in work whilst the political elite skims off a little for themselves through the taxation on the debt based profits. In many ways, Trump is a challenge to the “Publicsectocracy” he is not part of the political elite, although we would argue that, in reality, he is a beneficiary of what we call debtamorphosis. His empire has a value a fraction of what it is claimed it is worth a fact he needs to accept, but it has the “worth” it has, because of debt based asset price inflation.\nHowever, there are some words of caution. His spending programme will indebt the USA to an extent greater than Clinton. However where they would spend the money on education and keeping the candle of the liberal establishment a light he will build things and invest in blue collar work but the outcome will not in a globalised world generate the endogenous growth envisaged. The Money will simply flood abroad.\nIn the end, however, Trump’s biggest challenge will be to deliver to the constituency who elected him. A constituency who will expect a quick fix for their alienation and low wages. His context is a country of mass ignorance, of sad embittered people who feel angry; scarily he needs to meet the needs of these people. He has thankfully done on behalf of the public what was needed in respect of the elite. We need less of the expert and the elite and certainly, they need less pay. However, only half of what a Blue Revolution wanted is knocking the elite. Having achieved this he has also to deliver work, wages and the American dream to the alienated masses. Donald, you are like a dog chasing a fast moving car…….however you are the dog who has caught up and has the car clamped between its jaws, what are you going to do with it.\n12.11.16 To the left leaning liberal elite “Populism” becomes fascism. Their hostility however is simply a fear that the “blue Collar” masses will challenge their now faltering social and economic model\nThe word populism isn’t used to explain Clinton winning the “popular vote” but it has been antagonisingly used to explain the upsurge in the “deplorable” vote. Somehow people voting on mass for Clinton is seen as demonstrably different from people voting on mass for Trump. This Trump Blue Revolution is seen as appalling and frightening in equal measure but for us, the worst case scenario would have been the return of Clinton voted for by the smug self-satisfied the brainwashed and downright mislead. The vast majority of Clinton supporters are brainwashed into thinking the Clinton’s “socioeconomic” model has a sustainable future, will deliver for ordinary Americans and will lead to more social justice. On all counts, we disagree emphatically. More of the same debamorphosis, funnelling tax and debt based revenue into the pockets of the elite with the overspill generously handed out to the poor as a form of virtue signalling and all delivered on an industrial scale. The mob of hucksters in the upper reaches of the US political system can’t believe that they have finally been rumbled. Clinton is probably no criminal unless ensuring you do nicely from the tax payer and public sector and big business is a criminal rather than a moral offence.\nOne small additional point we wish to emphasise is that the populism on both sides of the Trump Clinton divide is very much due to Constituency marketing. The Clinton’s went for the economically illiterate but socially aware young, the lower ranks of the publicsectocracy and the wealthy but guilty (similar to the UK’s Champagne socialists) whilst the Trump campaign went for the exact opposite. Both camps, however, miss the essential point about the tensions between their campaigns. People want to see change; the politicians gave them meat they could recognise from their polarised vantage points which achieved the result of getting Trump elected and the popular vote going to Clinton. However, most ordinary Americans (and Brits) are divided on the basis of criteria which is perhaps intended to miss their common interests.\nWhat are these common interests? The real issues that were lost in the polarisation of an angry and vexatious campaign and which clearly need sorting out if a true Blue Revolution is to energise more than about half the population. Regrettably so far only the half who are angry about knowing they have lost out, rather than those who have been seduced by the rhetoric and do not yet know they are actually losing out as well…..they just don’t know it yet. So who are those who are suffering from an “unknown known”? We go in search of the lost constituency of working class voters.\nThe most obvious group are the students. Rightly fed a diet of socially progressive ideals; tolerance to difference etc but at the same time led to believe that these progressive ideas is political as opposed to economic. The free market demands “diversity” let us be honest the marketisation of sex is driven by economics, not politics. We don’t see Hilary Clinton saying “market your genitals”. No, it is a product of economics as so is Gay Marriage, Gay rights, transgendered rights and free movement. Capitalism’s Contract Choice and Consent. To see this as purely political and therefore Clinton’s unique selling point is stupid. Trump may have appealed to blue collar workers and “red necks” but we are certain he has no negative views on most of the above.\nStudents are particularly vulnerable to liberal bull-shit. They get indebted to keep left liberals in well renumerated “academic” work. Work that is unwilling to stray into “sociological” areas that have been vacated by “lefties” since most of the numbers show they are totally wrong about everything social; immigration, big government, family life, religion, contract choice and consent no less. If students thought about their student debt and stopped obsessing about rights, they might see that the biggest threat to their long-term future is the liberal left.\nThe next big constituency is the low ranking members of the Publicsectocracy. These people think that their wages terms and conditions are safeguarded by the state. They are not. The bottom of the public sector is not protected by the top echelons of the state. The top echelons look after themselves first and the tactical end of things end up penalised and privatised. The issues that the top publicsectorcrats cite to the lower order as reasons to be “progressive” are economic rather than political, see above. Yet the economics they promote militate against the lower orders. Most notably unemployment due to immigration, high house prices due to immigration. This con trick that progressive politics is all down to the liberal left is rubbish. People want freedom, contract choice and consent and the liberal left offer the expensive, privileged and inefficient state and then more of the same. Ordinary people should see Trump and Brexit as not about restricting the freedom to be yourself but as liberating people economically from the power of the state; the Brexiteers and Trump supporters should be joined by a young constituency of people who share progressive values and yet see that currently, the power of the State can only deliver debt and unemployment for those who are not part of the elite i.e. 99.7 % of us.\n16.11.16 The dislocation of the State from the people is a symptom of an age old process of evolution. However this time it is the “liberal” state that is thwarting progress!\nDonald Trump, Brexit and the “populism” in Europe and elsewhere is likely to erupt all over the liberal elite. Or as we prefer to call them the illiberal elite. We have been scratching our heads trying to offer a practical application to illustrate why the old ways of doing things are resistant to change whilst the public knows that the western social and economic model fails the “sniff test” and needs to evolve. We had a rather interesting paper sent through to us which we think can illustrate the contradictions between the state and the people and it is concerned with the British criminal justice system. Reading it some people might have to rise above their impulsive anger but if one clears one’s mind of prejudice and tries to actively avoid making too many pre-judgements and assumptions it does open up a fertile area for debate which we think contributes a lot to understanding why the west is in the mess it is in with its general public knowing something is wrong but perhaps not why.\nSo here goes. The criminal justice system has many characteristics which have been carried over from the medieval period. The Judge dispensing justice on behalf of the monarch reflects the systems feudal origins. In the US with no monarch, the term “the people” is used but it is not clear to what extent the interests of the “people” are really considered within the US system. In the UK the be-wigged Judge elevated and enrobed was historically intended to install fear, the aim being to emphasise the awesome power of the state in a visible way intended to intimidate an illiterate “mob”. The point is clear the state needed to emphasise its power and it’s “objectivity” as it dealt with the condemned, intent on breaking them physically and mentally before their eventual and very public destruction.\nBack in those days, the State was the name given to the business of exercising powerful vested interests; the King, the aristocracy and those in lower capacities who relied on the state’s largesse. In constant fear of the mob, justice had to be brutal. Whilst by modern standards this might seem appalling, the system was “just” as if there were a revolution the system that would replace the state would be no less and possibly even more brutal than that overthrown. This was the era of retribution and deterrence. It was an unforgiving system and perhaps reflects the west’s naivety in getting embroiled in regime change in the Middle East!\nBetween the 18th and the early part of the 20th-century things were transforming, as merchants and then industrialists became the vested interests determining the nature of the then modern state. The criminal justice system began to reflect these changes eventually losing some of the brutality as more “industrial” and “scientific” methods were introduced. However whilst the criminal justice system overall might have evolved (with penal policy introducing concepts of reform and then rehabilitation) the courts remained the visible pinnacle of state power, the power over life and death for what was still seen as a largely unpredictable and illiterate mob.\nEven the low crime rate which preceded the first world war was insufficient to shift the notion that the State was under constant threat from a revolutionary mob. There were of course threats, but being realistic they were not existential threats to the nation-state. The state, unwilling to change how it presented itself to the masses, continued to offer an awesome spectacle in court, of bewigged and robed judges and officials dispensing the power of the state with the intent of breaking the miscreant and sending a clear warning to others. Whilst reform and rehabilitation were entering the criminal justice process driven by reformers who were able to distribute capitalism’s wealth benignly, the operation of the courts remained resolutely medieval in character, and so it is today. However, today we don’t have an illiterate ‘mob’ and who exactly are the vested interests shaping the nature of the State and it’s institutions of power and authority such as the courts?\nWell, ‘capitalism’ has given way to the ‘free market’ which unlike capitalism, is an utterly amoral system easily ‘gamed’ by anyone with the money and ability to work out how to best fulfil their own selfish financial interests. Capitalism had its faults, but on the plus side, it created unprecedented amounts of wealth sufficient to reform society and lifted people out of poverty into work and in so doing conferred rights like contract choice and consent. The people who benefited the most were those who previously had been enslaved and powerless, the human property of the feudal state.\nThe ‘free market’ however has only one significant legacy. The legacy of debt pursuing immoral behaviour. Whilst people are now free thanks to capitalism they are also indebted. An indebted, as oppose to illiterate ‘mob’. Whilst still possessing and dispensing power the state like the individual consumer is reliant on debt to enable it to pay for its institutions of power and authority. There is no longer productive western ‘capitalism’ funding benign developments in the capitalist systems interests.\nThe courts, community sentences and prisons come in for critical evaluation within this debt reliant economic context. The courts and prisons are for most people the most visible manifestations of state power, however, they punish the same group of individuals who fund them; the indebted ‘mob’\nbetter known as the general public. This is why the system fails the public’s ‘sniff test’. The public is feeding the system with wrongdoers and the public is funding the system with taxpayers money, the only people who benefit from the modern criminal justice system are those whose salaries are paid for by it. Can this contradiction be resolved?\nSo in summary, we have an economic system which is dependent on debt and a state which relies on mass indebtedness with it’s associated immorality to pay for its institutions of power and authority. As for the criminal justice system, it punishes the same group of people who pay for it through their debt and taxation. Those unfortunate enough to find themselves managed by the criminal justice system are those who are the weakest in this perverse debt based economic model; their behaviour being shaped either by indebtedness or the conspicuous lack of public morality. They are the victims of this immoral system and they are punished by it too.\nThe Courts\nThe British criminal and civil justice systems act as though the early 21st century is the same as the mid-nineteenth century, with the full power of capitalism’s productivity driving the engine of economic and social growth at home and within the empire. Thus the justice system reflects the fact that it believes it is operating in the name of a vested interest and that this vested interest has a different set of demands and expectations from the public, a public from whom they are artificially differentiated. The old tactics of be-wigging, robes, titles and elevation continue to reflect this differentiation, just as it always has done. These practices are a direct link back to the days of the feudal system and thus are at odds with what people actually feel about themselves and their “he who pays the piper calls the tune” relationship to the state and its institutions and powers. Whilst the public are not perceived as a revolutionary mob when they enter the court system, they are treated like one and yet….. it is the public who are in reality now the ‘vested interest’ who pay for this system and the army of staffers and officers who run it.\nThe criminal justice system works on a “just deserts” model. So much punishment, for so much crime! However, there is something wrong with a system that costs the general public billions of pounds, promotes tax indebtedness and operated in a society which exposes the most vulnerable to a corrosive lack of collective morality (divorce, children being raised by the state, widespread sexual freedom or rather an absence of sexual restraint; the commoditization of everything including people).The state and therefore the courts should be representing the interests of the people but in absence of the public being viewed as a legitimate vested interest, the state acts to represent its own interests and in so doing separates its self from the will of the people. We would argue that this is what lies behind the failure of western governments to garner more than 50% public support. This is why ‘the system’ fails the publics ‘sniff test’.\nIf the power of the courts were to be used to reflect the vested interests of the general public who unlike big business actually pay their taxes, then the public would we think demand that a number of things should change. We would guess that there would be demand for the legal profession to be reformed and the roles duplicative roles of Queens Counsel, Junior Barristers and Solicitors modified to create a simple career structure. Justice could be affordable for the workers as of course, it should be.\nSecondly, the notion of Just Deserts fails spectacularly when it is both the public who pay for the just deserts and yet provide the cannon fodder for the “just deserts” system. In reality, who really has their interests served when an 80-year-old sex offender is sent to prison for 8 years at a cost to the taxpayer of three thousand pounds per week? If they understood the system, the public would not demand “Just Deserts” as defined by the state system, they would demand “Justice” and that would mean an affordable “no more harm” approach to sentencing and punishment. More liberal and progressive perhaps than state-sponsored liberal elite!\nA thirty-foot prison wall is not always necessary to deliver “Just Deserts” or prevent “no more harm”, likewise, some cases serially re-offend and just deserts lets them continue re-offending by passing short meaningless custodial sentences. It fails the “sniff test”. This just deserts model does, however, deliver incomes and salaries to a vast array of state workers. thankfully we believe there is not too much reform required. However, the impact of the two changes described above would be catastrophic for the people who currently act “legitimately” as the only vested interest currently recognised within the system; namely the vested interest of the politicians, officials and lawyers of the state.\nCommunity Sentences\nThese owe their existence to a belief at the turn of the capitalist 20th century, that people were not only capable of reform, but they wanted to reform. Back then the culture of the western world was simple, protestant and monogamous. There was, therefore, a simple template against which all could be measured. Capitalism needed sober healthy hard working workers so invested in criminal justice believing that personal reform was not only desirable but also possible. Thus the long march towards the current array of community sentences was started. Today there are numerous interventions and initiatives all paid for by the general public who often feel the efforts to reform are a waste of money and simply create more opportunities to re-offend. Again failing the “sniff test”. The just deserts concept militates against the public’s safety and Queens Peace by keeping the low seriousness, nuisance individuals out of custody. If the criminal justice system was invested with the public’s interest as it was of the capitalists, it would demand that community punishments should be better targetted to those who would genuinely benefit from them. They would not be available for those who due to weakness, stupidity or narcissism feel no need to improve their self-management and reduce the risk they pose to others. For this group, prison is probably the answer.\nPrison\nWe began by looking at the aims of sentencing as it has evolved over the last hundred years: retribution, deterrence and more recently reform and rehabilitation have come to define the role of prison and punishment within a just deserts model. The problem, however, is that prison and punishment do not deliver deterrence, reform or rehabilitation. Prison does not deter or rehabilitate, it is a home from home for too many damaged and inadequate victims of the free market. Men and women who stumble from one social and emotional crisis to the next. The lack of any collective morality permits the system to get away with exercising little if any real influence as they lock people up for a month sometimes a week at a time.\nTo overcome some of these obvious shortcomings just deserts needs to reflect the vested interests of the general public as oppose to the vested interests of the system itself. Those who can be in the community and be made safe should be in the community and made safe, even if it appears to offend the principle of just deserts. After all, just deserts was in the past paid for by a productive capitalist economy. With the now largely broken free market economy and indebted public paying for the system, justice needs to be redefined to make it affordable, effective and defensible.\nSo bringing these threads together, the answer seems to us be some reform of the whole system of justice. Prisons should be used to house those serial offenders and dangerous people who are incapable of managing in the community, irrespective of just deserts, whilst others could gain their just deserts in the community. Just deserts in this latter sense would be delivered by a combination of tracking, tagging, monitoring, curfews, exclusions, loss of passport, driving licence etc; a very punishing regime indeed fulfilling just-deserts at very little cost to the indebted taxpayer.\nSo what is the point of all this? Well, in summary, the Criminal Justice System like all state institutions no longer represents an elite who are responsible for paying for it. The wealth held by rich individuals today is not created by productive “capitalist” type activity it is generally debt based and in addition the wealthy are first in the queue for tax avoidance. So with no wealthy elite paying for the state and getting influence as a result, the state which comprises politicians and lawyers serve their own political and legal interests. The state does not serve the people who pay for it; namely, the blue collar workers and this is why we believe we are getting the Brexit and Trump phenomenon. The disconnect comes from the public not getting the influence they deserve as they are seen by the state elite as merely the people who pay to keep the state serving itself!!! Reversing this is the stuff of a Blue Revolution.\n21.11.16 When there is a global crisis what makes “Tone” think the ordinary man and woman will value his “contribution” particularly to something like Brexit? Sometimes we ask the obvious questions.\nBoring !\n22.11.16 Why are the liberal elite, “elite”? Because they are the top end of the State of course.\nWe have explored the anatomy of the western world’s anomie and we believe that the existence of this goes some way to explaining the success of the populism of Trump and Brexit campaigns. We have enlarged on this theme and we have argued that unlike the past when the “state” promoted the vested interests of powerful economic interests it shies away from reflecting the interests of the public who pay for it and prefers instead to concern itself with ts own interests. Hence we have welfare that has gone mad, a belief that the twin blights of a housing shortage and homelessness are the sole responsibility of government to cure and that correcting every illness from body dysmorphia and infertility to gender realignment and obesity is the responsibility of the state to fund. This creeping over-reliance on the state keeps the liberal elite in well-paid occupations and enjoying “career progression” whilst directing the thoughts of those responsible for paying for it towards the virtuousness of their benevolence. This is socialism. Socialism is expensive and ultimately by the state adopting a passive response towards “mission creep” the public pay for a system that is both expensive and inefficient. Socialism is essentially the “state” doing stuff it wants to do and with no actual contract with the state the public pick up the tab whether they want to or not.\nThe power to guide the activities of the state is what the liberal “elite” are for. We the ordinary person in the street have no say over the state and what it gets up to. So as our last contributor but one suggested we have a criminal Justice System which obsessed with “just deserts” and with prison as the ultimate penalty, regularly exposes the public to the horror of urban crime whilst “manageable” risks end up languishing behind a wall at a cost of thousands per week. The public would want justice and this means protection from harm, not retribution or deterrence those feudal ideas that belong to hell holes like Saudi Arabia.\nAs it is with criminal justice so it is with health and housing. People have become ignorant of the fact that a country has to pay its way and thus the combination of welfare induced social and moral decay (all too evident in too many parts of the western world), naive post-war expectations and health and housing stock asymmetries combine to ensure that the root cause of problems is refashioned to ensure the creeping role of the state is maintained. It is all too evident to us that a good measure of a country’s moral, social and economic health is to gauge how many “middle class” people are in the pay of the state. In the Uk for example if you discounted the state workers above tactical and operational grades there would be a very small “middle class” indeed.\nWould a small middle class be a bad thing or a good thing? Well, the state provides the influential well-paid work for the liberal elite and without the state doing what it does many would be out of work. On the other hand, the public is paying a lot for their state and would be better off with some shrinkage. It is of course, possible to conceive of a state that through the proper contracting arrangement with the public could offer real policy choice and government by consent thus avoiding the “Trump effect”. This rather than the liberal elite’s view that it illiberal not to have an ever encroaching “benign” and informed state to help and guide when needed.\nJust like the debt-laden free market which games the economic system to ensure that it looks after its interests (corporations, banks and markets in the main) so the state and its elite, our state and “our” elite does what it believes is right for us, whilst we the tax payers pay for their pleasure whilst impotently standing by and watching them **** it up.\n25.11.16 Ok Blair, Clagg et al are clearly “counter revolutionary”. What should be the response of a peaceful revolution ?\nWe opted not to examine Blair’s offer to assist Britain with Brexit on the basis that the question of his motive was too obvious to require addressing. Blair is a narcissistic and delusional god complex nut case in the mould of David Ike. However, bonkers or not, he draws in a number of others, all fellow travellers amongst the liberal elite who seem to be scheming to derail Brexit. The view of these people is that the British public are too stupid to know what is best for them and that we need to be guided like children by our masters and betters.\nThe problem with the Blair model as we point out incessantly, is that it is a continuation of the socialist triumph of the state over the individual. This model, necessary after the last war in Europe has over reached and now finances an immoral system which in any period including this one is utterly unaffordable and unsustainable in the long term. However, it is a business model that makes the senior officers of the state and business people who can game the free market very wealthy. This is the EU model and Blair and co do very nicely thank you. The problem, which isn’t being discussed is that this model will eventually collapse under the weight of its unsustainable contradictions. What are these contradictions? Well, public debt is engorged by mass migration, but that translates as a positive figure in the minds of the “Remain” crew making us the “fifth largest economy in the world”. We borrow and spend and it makes our economy look healthy just like with the compulsive borrower and gambler all this stops eventually. Within an economy mass migration is a bit like a drug ; it forces the government to spend money and spending on migration like spending money on drugs makes the economy feel good and look good…. short term. But long term it has to stop often as a result of some kind of paralysis caused by the simple unaffordability of the model.\nHousing inflation feels good to those with houses but locks people out of the housing market; both as tenants and owner occupiers. Migration probably creates the largest push factor on housing (along with divorce) particularly inner city housing; driving up rent values and creating an out of town demand for “new build”. So Brexit might reduce the pressure on housing and the loss of government spending and a reduction in housing inflation will translate into a slowing economy. However long term this is sustainable and is indeed beneficial. The same goes for the devaluation of the pound. We are once again getting a sense of the British economy based on real economics not the distorting filter of Euronomics!\nWage levels are in the short term going to be driven to the minimum wage by continuing immigration. Restrict migration to only those economic elites we need in the economy (as opposed to political elites that we need fewer of) and we will probably see wages rising at the lower wage levels. Wage levels being stagnant isn’t due to Brexit it is because we remain within the EU. Out of the EU and with a global approach to recruiting the brightest and best, our economy will benefit from global talent at the top whilst our flexible private housing market and welfare reform deliver British workers to British working class jobs at the delivery end of the economy.\nWhy would Blair and co want to avoid this obvious good news story? Well as part of the EU elite Blair and co have a perverse attachment to a government model that offers people like them (and their families) well paid but essentially pointless jobs managing the people of a continent. The people of the EU are getting wise to the fact that these elite Euro jobs are largely irrelevant whilst working class jobs are under threat from migration and over regulation. But more importantly their taxes and debt pay for a system that looks sustainable in the short term but that will eventually collapse taking them down whilst the elite takes their “earnings” paid by workers taxes and move to Dubi or similar.\nIf Blair and Co loved Britain as much as they loved Brussels they would applaud Brexit and the life-affirming opportunities it gives Britain to escape the debt-burdened incoherence of the EU. Leaving the EU (hard or soft) will help other nations develop a sustainable economy that through trade brings the chance of greater peace across the planet. It will help Britain recover from the consequences of its numerous recessions and help it begin to repay its indebtedness. Free trade is the DNA of European and world peace but regrettably for Britain and us at a Blue Revolution the EU seem intent on preventing Britain from having free trade within the EU customs area. Denial of free trade is a serious weapon the EU and their elites want to use against Britain. Blair and Co working in our interests? No, as usual, just their own!\n28.11.16 The trouble for girls is clear and simple; it’s the amoral free market stoopid!\nIs the western world a safe place for girls? It seems such an unnecessary question given that in Iran a girl can’t sing in public and in Saudi Arabia being female is almost a crime. We don’t need to look at Egypt or Somalia to register that in these countries being female is a risk to your reproductive health. So in the West, we would assume girls have never had it so good.\nThe West’s progress has ensured that the laws on marriage allow easy divorce, that girls can have jobs in every field of work, that the horror of pregnancy outside of marriage is mitigated by welfare and there is abortion on demand. With the consequences of this package of 20th-century reforms, girls should have a bright and aspirational future. However, the general opinion seems to be; girls in the West are unhappy and this is reflected in low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide.\nA recent British documentary highlighted the challenges for an Afghan girl as she fought to avoid being sold as a bride (to provide money for her brother) and her fight to be free to achieve her musical ambitions. She was throughout very philosophical; even when told by her grandmother she could be sold to an eighty-year-old. As a young Western girl, you might conclude OMG!\nHowever, OMG hardly captures the reality. Too many western girls behave with a level of self-loathing that would be understandable if they were being sold to an eighty-year-old. But why? Well we believe that girls in the West have lost part of one gender identity as full-time mothers and gained another partial identity as workers whilst being sold two myths; one is that the “free market” delivers happiness via mass consumption and that the tendency to objectify themselves and therefore others is due to them personally rather than a process encouraged by the free market to maximise consumption. This latter point is reflected in attempts to get girls to “get real” about themselves. The girls need to “get real” about the “free market”!!\nThe free market is a means of making money. Unlike in the past when making money was about creating jobs today the jobs are in China or India. This has elevated consumption above production as the main economic preoccupation. Consumption doesn’t require a working class it simply requires consumers and a means of creating enough wealth to provide the means of consumption (as opposed to the means of production). This wealth can be engineered by governments in the form of welfare spending or it can be “liberated” from increased asset values like house price increases. Whilst men and women are cast in the role of consumer (consumer having replaced subject or citizen) it seems to us that being a woman has added complication in that personal consumption can be increased by dint of one’s attractiveness or ability to be relaxed about getting pregnant whilst dependent upon state benefits.\nIn the past the two roles women could take advantage of were separated by marriage. Worker prior to marriage and mother thereafter. Today they are blended but the blending is simply intended to maximise the woman’s consumer capacity, so loyalty to others disappears for them as well as for men. For both males and females being with the rich man and marrying the beautiful woman is the corrosive aspiration downloaded into everyone at birth. In the case of men low wages exclude them from the mass consumer club, for women, average looks have the same effect. (an attractive woman can “trade up”) For both, debt can, in the short-term increase ones “consumption coefficient” but for women, the conflict between the two roles is mediated if not indeed manipulated by government policy, in particular, welfare. The problem for girls is that being conflicted around serious life choices is dispiriting, depressing and confusing and eventually it is too easy to default to having children; wanted or not!! thereby opting out of the world of work or being compromised with a work life balance that puts work before children.\nFinally, for too many men the alternative to being successful is suicide; physically removing themselves from the gene pool….often having sired a couple of children. The most recent figure show that suicide is the highest cause of death for men between twenty and thirty-four. For others, crime is another “alternative” career that creates a consumer capability.\nThe free market is not wholly a force for good it has the capacity to corrupt and distort peoples expectations, turning love, loyalty and duty into different forms of greed. The public feel this on both sides of the Atlantic but possibly don’t understand where the feeling comes from. However, the “free market” loving political elite neither feel nor understand the problems with this inhuman and corroding system and are therefore shocked when the public reject them because they won’t reform, modify or control this system.\n02.12.16 The Blue Revolution has some challenges which the “liberal elite” might find uncomfortable. Let us examine one!\nThe experts have just concluded that advice and education is a waste of time when it comes to controlling alcohol misuse and pricing policy is more effective. In this world of “rational expectations” does this help us to understand how best to create a nonreligious morality fit for the 21st century?\nSince the turn of the 20th century, there has been a slow relentless decline in moral behaviour. It has been met by an ever expanding system of welfare that the public sector elites view quite wrongly as “progressive”. How such a word can be used to justify a policy which undermines moral choices is hard to comprehend. Here at a Blue Revolution, we believe in Contract, Choice, and Consent and take the view that adults should be capable of navigating their lives within this moral framework with some limited scope for state support in the short term as necessary for individuals who fall on hard times. However with a western society grown fat and lazy on welfare and state largess something needs to be done to re-engineer society back to a place where adults are fully competent moral agents and not the beneficiaries of an undermining culture of state money and a sanctimonious moral relativism. The contract, Choice, and Consent should be all that is required to underpin a truly moral society. We are going to look at Contract, Choice, and Consent in relation to procreation.\nAt the time of the birth of Britain’s welfare state, society was moral to the point where too many personal choices were deemed immoral and in some cases like homosexuality illegal. This was both a dark age and an age of peculiar enlightenment. Christianity left a legacy of marriage by consent and those mature enough to understand the awesome obligations associated with marriage went on to provide loving stable and productive homes for themselves and their children. The element of choice and consent is there and the marriage ceremony itself is an “illiterates contract”. The persecution of gays and lesbians was and remains immoral. A person sexuality has no relevance to their social or economic productivity.\nUnfortunately, society changed, in some ways for the better but not in all ways. Something commonplace during the war but which lay dormant after the war began to filter into society and that was “sexual abandon”, a bi-product of war which became “sexual liberation” in the 1960’s. Sexual liberation was heralded by the “shagging” community as a way of marking themselves out from the more buttoned up or as they would argue repressed community. The sex scandals of the present age have their origins in this “sexual liberation”. It was and still is a predators charter.\nSexual liberation is bad enough when the consequences are hurt feelings, personal disgust, and divorce, but it significantly worse when a child is produced either because of “sexual liberation” or a child is caught in the middle of “sexually liberated parent(s).\nSo having exposed what we consider to be the problem; what do we see as the solution? Well, it can’t be more of the same, state money to subsidise wanton stupidity. No, if we have to consider the financial consequences of millions of selfish “liberated” life choices we might take the view that this liberation has to stop. to avoid behaving like some prig or moral dinosaur such as we find in dust bowl Islamic societies like Saudi Arabia we need to protect individual choices and respect an adult’s moral agency. Contract, Choice and Consent does this. But what of those who fail to behave like adults, the children of the age of sexual liberation for whom Contract, Choice and Consent are irrelevant concepts.\nWell, this is where we at a Blue Revolution become a little more draconian; because a society based on Contract Choice and Consent has to have a way of encouraging compliance with responsible behaviour and disincentivize morally poor behaviour. This is done by having a national policy of DNA registration. A pregnancy is no longer an act of one sided selfishness with the more vulnerable gender picking up the moral pieces and the social disapproval. The process should be based on consent and choice and a contract between the parents to support the child. In the absence of this being negotiated by free mature moral agents, the state should step in and force the parents, confirmed via DNA to support their offspring. If education doesn’t work for alcohol misuse why would we assume it would work for reckless procreation.\nThe “liberal elite” will argue that registering DNA is an infringement of human rights. That is because there is money to be made from the social and moral chaos upon which the state thrives. However just as all our rights are now contingent on fair play to all of us taxpayers, particularly now that the wealthy corporations have decided that tax avoidance is a moral imperative, knowing who has sired whom and therefore who should pay is essential to help re-motivate people towards improved moral behaviour. We would argue that this change will be a bitter pill for the underclass to swallow, but it will we guarantee….note guarantee, improve the lives and expectations of boys and girls, put promiscuity into retreat and place children as the pinnacle of a safe and coherent union between parents who have thought about children ahead of a promiscuous lifestyle. No punishing the fornicators, no sex education explaining what to do with your “farm parts” just a lesson in contract choice and consent and the consequences of having unprotected sex on your bank balance and future happiness and prosperity. Here at Blue Revolution, we consider that as sexual intercourse releases powerful hormones it is a bit like a drug. So let’s tackle its worst social aspects in the manner of substance misuse. Let’s treat it like a dangerous substance!\n04.12.16 What is wrong with “Remainers”? Their love of the State doesn’t stop with the EU that’s what!\nThe Lib Dems are claiming to have made a come back with electoral success based they say on a campaign which was largely anti Brexit. It is not clear to us why the sort of people who live in Richmond would be 70% in favour of “remain”. However, there are other “affluent” constituencies which also have a similar profile so perhaps it is about being affluent. Here at a Blue Revolution, we are well enough educated, and global in outlook but not affluent so unlike the affluent we can’t accept the idea of an expensive government over running our lives or accept the idea of rule by superstate.\nIn the twenty-first century, the superstate is essentially an arrangement which sees the little bit of non-debt backed value created by workers being consumed by the state, for the ultimate benefit of the state. The welfare, health and human rights industries to name but three are basically the use of ordinary people’s lives and tax revenues to justify extraordinary wages for the states army of workers. Perhaps Richmond is full of well-paid state workers (£100K+) and bankers who either don’t have to worry about business profitability as they are Civil Servants or think that flogging debt to almost bankrupt European’s contributes to sustainable long-term progress.\nThe problem these affluent people face is their inability to accept there is a democratic deficit in staying in the EU. Whilst getting out might look complicated…. the problem is no one gave the tax paying public the option of opting into the superstate, it was a choice made for us by the elite. So now with all the soft fascism the elite can muster (even in the UK’s Private Eye and the Lib Dems pro-EU posturing amongst others) we need to resist the elites continued pleading for us to stick with their grand plan. We also need to resist the ideas of a left alliance of Greens and the Lib Dems who think Labour will help them salvage what for Brexiteers is the nightmare of remaining. This as we said, is a scenario that the public didn’t vote for and did actually vote against.\nIn reality and with the power of technology the State needs to wither away (a bit….or a lot ) but holding on to control and power runs against the interests of the ordinary people who want less of the State and its cost, not more. With idiots like the putative left alliance having a tantrum all over the place about everything, the prospect of the state continuing to strut it’s wholly tax gobbling and all too often self-serving and pointless stuff, is certain. Brexit starts the process of change.\n07.12.16 We are the people, the people are not the State. The State should be the servant of the people but with an elite in charge the State is our master!\nWe have commented on the relationship between the people and the State in various posts over the last few months and particularly as we worked our way towards Brexit. Concepts like “vested interests” “the establishment” only have meaning when the State and the people do not share common values. We believe that under the economic system that was known as Capitalism the State operated in the interests of the Capitalist class. Upholding “capitalist values”. These reinforced inequality in wages and flowing from that limited the rights of the workers to enjoy the full freedoms afforded by Contract, Choice and Consent. This went as far as creating a lifestyle limited environment of poor health, ignorance and low expectations.\nThe post-war era accelerated the process of turning the capitalist system around. it achieved this by putting the State centre stage, no longer operating on behalf of the vested interests of the Capitalist system which many viewed as the cause of World War II. Post war the State became the operator of big businesses, welfare protected the workers and the Grammar Schools elevated the children of “workers” into the establishment. It was like the children’s books of the day presented it; a rosy era for the working class. Those of us who remember this period remember a time when people were generally happy responsible and the state seemed to work for the people.\nThe post-war period was not all good news, however. “The People” were all too often represented by a labour movement hell bent on destroying a system that had really ceased to exist in the west BY THE 1970’S. British firms were being turned into commissioning bodies manufacturing abroad. The horror of the capitalist system was now largely inflicted on the proletariat of China, Korea, Vietnam etc. The left wing put the final nails in the coffin of what remained of the British manufacturing and extractive industries because of their blinkered ideological ignorance they viewed “Industry” as capitalist, so it was necessary to destroy industry and the jobs that went with it.\nThe challenge is this; what do you do when your capitalist system is collapsing around your ears. When not- withstanding its many flaws it no longer delivers the value and wealth necessary to support consumption by an increasingly entitled population. Well, you recognise that “globalisation” has a different way of delivering wealth and you try and game it to your advantage. This is what the people see as the problem with the current system. It is also why the traditional “left” have no answers. The state manages wealth and much of this wealth is generated by the debt and tax of workers. Unable to countenance any suggestion of a return to “capitalism” the left just promotes the same Tax and spend model to maintain demand and consumer satisfaction.\nThe problem is that by replacing vast swathes of the economy (if you don’t believe this take any British county or city and work out how many people work for its biggest employers; the NHS, Schools, County and District councils plus the odd prison or MOD Base etc) the government is trapped into maintaining itself first and foremost, and then it looks to supporting the rest of the economic system. This is the mechanism by which the state becomes the master of the people. Protecting the States interests is the main purpose of the state and its army of pointless 100K+ “Senior Leaders”. The people get in the way of this “nice little earner” hence the hissy fits from Statists like Britains Nick Clegg and an assortment of the State elites in parliaments (EU, Westminster, Scottish, Welsh, NI Assembly) and their supporting administrations; “Civil Servants” and Courts.\nSo what is the solution? Well to coin a phrase the workers need to raise their consciousness. Not like some long haired student Marxist bamboozled by the complex nature of Marxism who believes that the State is the answer to the inequalities of the world, but by realising that the State keeps a lot of people on great salaries doing very little that matters to ordinary people and these State people are the elite who work the system to their long-term advantage. A sort of perpetuating of disadvantage by pretending or virtue signalling that they are doing the opposite.\nThe modern economy has so much government in it that it can be easily characterised as a system operated by the State that takes workers debt and tax and turns it into salaries for its self-selecting elite. People like Nick Clegg, Keir Starmer, the Kinnocks, Blairs, the Judges of the higher courts and an army of people who do stuff in our name but not with our consent!!\n07.12 16 An Industrial strategy needs a policy on debt and pensions. These are yesterday’s challenge tomorrow!\nAn industrial strategy needs to cover a number of issues in the now globalised world. We think that dwarfing energy prices and other global uncertainties are the problems of debt and pensions. How did we get here? The modern free market is not capitalism. Capitalism requires the accumulation of capital. This was appropriated from workers in the form of the profits made by underpaying the workers. In a capitalist system, this capital became the basis for future investment, economic growth and of course future exploitation of workers.\nAs we argue the capitalist system had its faults but it was the progenitor of what we now have come to recognise as the modern world. It reflected the troika of Contract, Choice and Consent which underpins freedom and democracy and it demanded of those subject to its discipline a responsible way of life that required people to take care of themselves and their families and to have regard for their communities. They had to work out how to manage the wages borne of the exploitation by the capitalist. With the combination of Contract, Choice and Consent and the responsible worker looking to protect their families the fundamental building blocks of freedom and democracy became well established by the 1930’s. They endured the war and after the war, the government looked at the exploitation of an exhausted nation and intervened. They intervened to rebuild the economy and to minimise the levels of the wage exploitation by capitalists. The government never assumed that the qualities self-discipline hard wired into people by the capitalist system would not endure with a more interventionist government programme. They assumed that with welfare and pensions, health and education the future for working people was bright. It was until the beginning of the 1960’s.\nIn the 1960’s the capitalist system largely morphed into the modern free market. This is an immoral system. It has no context of responsible behaviour underpinning it. It encourages irresponsible social and economic behaviour. The post-war legacy of welfare became the means by which the free market managed to rid itself of any responsibility for the social and economic decline of the nation whilst relying on the welfare system to maintain wages and pensions. Sending work abroad and bringing migrants here allows the price of labour to decline whilst sending the manufacturing industry abroad allows free market profits to remain high. Paying for it all with debt and taxation allows consumer demand to be kept up benefitting the svengalis of the free market, people like Sir Philip Green. This is an almighty mess!\nPensions in the public sector, health care costs and a whole host of other inflating expenditures is bringing the national finances under unbearable strain. We need to start making a profit as a nation and relying on the “free market” with its urge to make money at the taxpayer’s expense really is not going to make Britain a leading industrial nation.\n10.12.16 The elite and their experts are still intent on confusing the public about the reality of Brexit and the “old world order”. But why? We look to the Uk for answers.\nIn the UK it is claimed Brexit means Brexit. Well that is like saying Justice means Justice; it means very little but unintentionally for Mrs May it sends a mixed message to those voters who Mr and Mrs Clegg and their NBF’s, the Blairs, Keir Starmer et al view as too stupid to understand the complex issues associated with the UK departing the EU; namely most of the British people both Brexiteers and Remainers.\nThe elites look down on the British people in a way that was inconceivable in the past; this is whether the people agree with them or not. Is it amongst other things our ability to load our sentences with actual often difficult meaning rather than speak articulately and yet simultaneously say nothing? it is our ability to live lives with none of the “status” craved by D-list “Slebs” and the elite in the places that warehouse them like the Big Brother House, BBC, EU and Westminster? or is it even more elemental?\nThe reason for their disdain, and if you don’t know what we mean watch Emily Thornberry MP, is the fact that we are no longer essential “factors of production” within the British economy. Factors of production that have to be “heard”, respected and won over to maintain capitalism’s promise of creating social and economic value and tax revenue for the State. We “the people” are now just a means by which the government can manipulate the economy to maintain aggregate demand through tax, debt and welfare and thus secure for a little longer the free market merry-go-round that keeps them in their positions of rank and privilege and allows some people who game the system to get rich. This maintains the pretence that the economic system is “just” and laden with opportunity for all. The modern Economic System delivers little by way of social and economic “justice”. We call it “secular wWesternism” as it delivers unhappiness, misery and destruction of the planet (no not the myth of solely man-made global warming stoopid) on an industrial scale.\nAs usual with a Blue Revolution, there is a lot in the above. Let us identify some examples. Global warming is the global issue most promoted by the elite. It helps to take the public’s eye of the “secular western” ball. The problem with the world economy is that with debt as the basis for economic prosperity there needs to be a ravenous “growth” to repay debt, replenish pensions and maintain stock and property prices. This requires an attack on our beloved planet like no other, over-population, deforestation and the volume of extraction, pollution and species annihilation, and yet whilst the elite talk of progress i.e. economic success reducing poverty and global conflict etc, we say yes, but at what price! Can it be done in a more planet-friendly way?\nTo tackle this head on the “elites” would need to scale back their own activities and recalibrate the world economy to something more sustainable and for them scary too; something measurable and achievable, co-operation and non-conflict based. Unwilling to change the nature of the western hegemony they promote “man-made global warming”; and Kyoto, the secular western elite’s impotent proxy for actually doing something to save the planet. Oh and the so called “Greens” buy into this rot too, along with the “storm troopers” of the elite……the academic “expert”.\nTo save the planet we would need to cut the birth rate through women’s education and employment, restrain the gender obsessions upon which too much of the free market is built and which across all demographics promotes reckless single parenthood. We must establish some global and universal values; we offer contract, choice and consent and we must stop the free market merry-go-round of “growth at all costs” and then more growth. This means moving away from a debt based economic model with the state as ringmaster to one based on achieving high levels of non-debt-based social and economic value by for example opening up Africa to agri-trade whilst restraining population movements by encouraging sustainable, non-growth obsessed economies in countries that currently export people rather than productivity.\nOn the Uk domestic front, the elites won’t tell you that the British economy is so dependent on migration that it actually needs “free movement of people” i.e. the movement to the UK of whole families. We have argued that “free movement of workers” is “just” and fair. However, it is unlikely to deliver the crippling levels of migration that the state needs to inflate the housing, property, stock and welfare markets which just so happen to contribute to the UK’s economic “growth”.\nThere is growth out there Jim but not as we know it, and as Brexit showed, not as we like it.\nApols to “The Firm”.",

A friend of the Millennials? We don’t think so! The state will simply continue to undermine the Nation something it is getting better and better at!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_where-are-the-weaknesses-in-the-main-parties-as-we-move-towards-a-general-election/content_310.html": "Where are the weaknesses in the main parties as we move towards a General Election?\nLet us start with the Conservative Party. Probably the only credible party of government in England and Wales. Whilst the Scots Nats are in Government in Scotland they can hardly be described as credible given their obsession with independence and lack of any grown up economic literacy. An independent Scotland would be bankrupt within five years but Sturgeon and co will have done Ok out of it before the collapse.\nThe Conservative Party is the party of the Nation State but a Nation State that still reflects the interests of those large corporations that are doing very well living off the fat of the nation’s debt. They can see there are problems with the way the nation operates, but they have no credible solution to solve the problems other than more of what has been tried before. More privatisation, more tax and National Insurance, more attempts by the public sector to cut services as it models itself on the private sector by simply creating more tax payer funded millionaires. The Tories aren’t going to be revolutionary but at least for the time being the engine of the nation state still runs.\nThe Brexit issue is also a bit toxic as there will be consequences following withdrawal from the EU. We argue these consequences might look bad, falling house prices (won’t that upset the banks), reduction in value of the Pound, and issues around migration. However, these are the issues that drive the debt and house price based economy and as such any change is in the long term going to be positive. The conventional parties will not want to see the economy contract and as now will simply tax us more to make up for reductions in the Governments income. The Tories like the other parties don’t recognise that it is we the people who’s interests they should serve and it is the cost of government, not our services that should be cut. But who is going to do that?\nWe think the Tories will win the election but with a small majority as now and a mandate to fudge and deplete the terms upon which Britain leaves the EU. Probably a fudge on the Customs Union to keep world trade out of the EU via Britain’s back door. That should keep the EU staffers happy.\nLabour are schizophrenic with a Blairite wing who still hanker after the “third way” mumbo jumbo and the “hard left” who hanker after a class war long after the “revolutionary” industrial and agricultural classes ceased to exist in any revolutionary form. They have morphed into the sad spectacle of what is described as the “underclass” the second and third generation unemployed industrial and agricultural workers. A horrible term for a group for whom the Blair “third way” offered the loss of work, family, status, and “self-reliance” and ushered in a life of ignorance and idleness on the dole. Labour have become out of step with all the main constituencies the Blairite middle class will vote Tory or Lib Dem or Green. The inner cities with their “culturally progressively” Labour Party branches will continue to return most Labour MP’s\nThe Lib Dems all but annihilated in 2015 will make a striking come back with an offer that every well-paid state “staffer”, banker and Remainer will support. The Lib Dems like the Green’s are terribly well intentioned but have no grasp on the realities of how their policies drive an economy to the brink of failure. They like the Green’s and Labour believe in the transformative power of the state, yet experience tells us that the state is incapable of transforming anything because it can’t cut costs and can’t transform itself.\nFinally the Green’s and Ukip. The Greens will offer socialism with a solar panel or two. Completely missing the point that the aggregate demand they seek to stimulate through “anti-austerity” simply allows the west to illegitimately gobble up more of the planet than in reality we should be able to afford. They do nothing to challenge the debt based economics that funds our consumption and lifestyles. It is possible the Greens might get a seat or two.\nUkip were a one trick pony. Great trick…..we have seen it now it’s time to **** ***. We don’t anticipate any wins for Ukip, the Tories will keep most of their seats with a bit of shuffling around between the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems. Ukip will experience their first existential crisis.",

But still the Tories should be worried.\nLet us just take a few issues. A lack of cultural integration, a debt based economy, an inefficient state sector that is barely democratic, a legal system too elite, remote and expensive for most to access, a political system designed to promote the interests of groups in binary opposition, a criminal justice system that still sees imprisonment as the ultimate sanction irrespective of whether the criminal is a danger to the public, a housing bubble that feeds the economy with debt and services the financial sector whilst relying on immigration and family breakdown to fuel the demand for more housing. A student demographic who can anticipate a form of pauperism as they progress asset-less and debt-burdened into the mid 21st century. We could go on but it is too depressing.\nWhat is needed is a revolution but not the big state oppression promised to the youth by Corbyn. His brand of socialism will not offer the young what they want, freedom, equality and opportunity but more state indebtedness, a lack of freedom in the economy and a perverse array of special pleading that will capture and sustain inequality within Labours various client groups. This is as we have said before largely gender inequality but could conceivably be anti-Semitic or homophobic so large and weird is Labours “big tent”.\nThe problem for the Tories is that Labours rubbish revolution is the only one in town and whilst he is moving backwards at least Corbyn is moving. The Tories, by contrast, have lost the optimism and vision that saw many of them, quite rightly lead the Brexit campaign on the basis of a global role for Britain in a world crying out for a new form of efficient values based 21s century leadership in a western world full of creaking and expensive post-war bureaucracies, just like the EU run by elites on behalf of elites.\nThe problems we have highlighted at the top of this post will not go away and those problems will get worse. Labour offers jam tomorrow but at a huge cost to future generations and as we have said there is too much weirdness making a prediction of what Britain might look like under a Labour government impossible to predict. It is possible that Corbyn will become the heir to Blair and we will have a return to the middle ground. But whether it is the middle ground from the Tories or Corbyn or 1970’s socialism from Corbyn, neither are the revolution Britain, the EU and the rest of the western world needs.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_will-labour-undermine-the-principle-consent-with-their-socialist-obsessions/content_348.html": "Will Labour undermine the principle of consent with their ‘socialist’ obsessions?\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels were clear; however “unfair” Capitalism was, it liberated people from any servitude based on inherited status or gender (as opposed to class) and had the transformative capacity to deliver justice based on the proletarianisation of all workers whether male or female. Their view was that capitalism’s principles (we call them Contract, Choice and Consent) should become enshrined in the brief socialist phase of history, before being seared into a post-socialist society by the “dictatorship of the proletariat”. Liberation from exploitation, of whatever sort (status, gender or class) was Marx’s “riddle of history solved”.\nSocialism is, therefore, a phase on the road to the full liberation of workers, not the end stop of that process. To work as it should, socialism needs a profitable capitalist system upon which to feed prior to the “dictatorship of the proletariat” emerging from the socialist state itself.\nThere are problems with this essentially 19th-century vision today, however, not least of which is the absence of real profitability generated by the exploitation of the worker within a powerful western capitalist economic system. A capitalist system that can be placed initially under the control of the state and then the working classes.\nToday it is the western blue-collar workers who finance the Nation State its politicians, banks and well-paid hangers-on. It is equally true that working class people are also more than likely to be of this unlovely collection, cast out into a kind of economic oblivion brought about by global forces, in particular, relatively high wage levels and low western economic productivity.\nThe free market racketeer who is often passed off as a ‘capitalist’ offshores profits and gets the Chinese government to exploit its workers on their behalf by producing ‘consumables’ in planet-destroying quantities. Globally this is a racket, not a system. It bears little resemblance to Capitalism, it is gamed by powerful forces including candidates like corporations and global investment, as well as unlikely characters like the BBC and political parties.\nIs there any good news in all this?\nWell yes, there is excellent news. Firstly with capitalism lasting as long as it did, socialism and social liberalism was able to give “social character” to values based on the capitalist principles of Contract Choice and Consent. We now have solid humane and liberal values within a framework of law which protects groups that in primitive (pre-capitalist) societies are hounded, bullied, persecuted or killed. This includes apostates, dissenters, gay people and women seeking liberation from the tyranny inflicted on their gender by state, tribe or caste. Capitalism has left a legacy of justice even though it was unarguably a very unfair system. To fail to understand this distinction between justice and fairness leaves the “socialist” open to the kind of idiocy one observes within the “Marxist” Labour Party today.\nEssentially the current iteration of Labour has a misguided view of capitalism’s legacy fetishised into ‘Tory’ hating. They fail to grasp that Western Capitalism is already dead replaced by global racketeering and that their parochial economic plans will be an insufferable burden on the working class for hundreds of years. They fail to understand the origins of liberal values within the capitalist system and so oblivious to real liberalism, hobnob with a collection of groups who like them might hate capitalism, but also hate its liberation of women and others too. They fail to grasp that control, exclusion and coercion are pre-capitalist principles and that by flirting with people who adopt them (and by adopting them themselves) they place the liberty of us all in jeopardy.\nOur economic situation is precarious enough with the racketeering of the global elites undermining our Nation States all over the western world, but with Labour, not only do we as workers have that to contend with but the probability under a Labour Government of a slow and remorseless rolling back of our freedoms to Contract, Choose and Consent to take us back to an age of overt State control. Marx and Engles were wary of the State. As with their mangling of the “many and the few” once again it’s clear to us Labour’s ideas are not what Marx or Engels would have had in mind when crafting their beliefs. Consent is not safe with Labour and we should all worry.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-challenge-of-islam-and-21st-century-consciousness/content_238.html": "The Challenge of Islam and 21st-century consciousness\nIslam’…….. what feelings does the word invoke? What feelings is the word intended to invoke? Well, that depends on who is saying ‘Islam’. In this brief paper by one of the founder six members of the group Blue Revolution, we are going to examine Islam from two perspectives and use as the basis for our examination the concept of consciousness which Blue Revolution believe is the best way of understanding the tensions which exist between those who embrace Islam hand those who don’t.\nIslam originated in the tribal areas of the seventh century Arab Peninsular when Mohammed the Prophet of Islam received the ‘word of God’, revealed to him by the Angel Gabriel. Gabriel had made an appearance some six hundred years earlier when he foretold of the Birth of Jesus who it was claimed by Christians was the son of God. The role of Gabriel gives these religions what we call their ‘Divine Narrative’. Divine Narrative is ‘evidence’ that what we are told is not simply a reflection of the life of Jesus the man or the Quran are thoughts of Mohammed another man, but they are both related to God. It was common in the period of antiquity to use such grand claims to make people accept things they might otherwise choose to reject. Plato the Greek Philosopher used such a grand claim he called a ‘Noble Lie’ to justify the rule of philosopher Kings over the masses.\nIslam has two core elements the Quran, the word of God revealed to Mohammed, and the Hadith. The Hadith is as important to most Muslims as the Quran, but the Hadith is a series of narrations by different people who claim to have known Mohammed. These narrations are not claimed to be related to God like the Quran.\nSo, in the Hadith, there are numerous references to Mohammed such as “I saw the prophet do this” or “I heard the prophet say that”. It is in the Hadith that one can read a lot about seventh-century tribal reality. How people had sex, what if any obligations one has to non-believers and how women are to be treated or indeed trained in the way of Islam. It is in the Hadith that stoning for adulterous behaviour is referenced. The punishment in the Quran for adultery is a modest one hundred lashes. However, It is fairly clear from both Quran and Hadith that adultery is to be punished with serious physical harm, that homosexuality is an abomination and that Islam is at constant war, a sort of holy tribal war, to vanquish all other cultures and impose on humanity the doctrines of.\nIslam is monotheistic, there is only one God Allah. The doctrine which supports this belief is called Tawhid. Tawhid is the concept of one perfect God and also reflects within this belief the unity of human behaviour with the word of God if people obey the Quran. It is clear why this is a challenge. The Quran does not easily fit in with the expectations of 21st Century people. Tawhid reflects the unity of God and humanity, as long as you do as God or Mohammed says.\nIf one could achieve Tawhid, argue some Islamic scholars one would create a “Heaven on Earth”, the perfect community an Islamic community. This desire to achieve unity between God and humanity via religious observance is what influences the consciousness of ISIS and other Islamist groups. The belief that applying Quranic law and Mohammed’s examples of social behaviour described in the Hadith leads to Heaven on Earth. The problem is, this Heaven on Earth requires women to accept God-given deficiency in ‘faith and intellect’ and Homosexuals to accept being killed as punishment for their ‘sin’. The overarching problem is therefore that everyone must submit to the same ‘idea’ of ‘The Word of God’ and interpretations of the numerous Hadith. A big ask even in Islam as no single doctrine exists in Islam which is accepted by all Muslims.\nTherefore the descriptions of the seventh century captured in the Quran and Hadith become the basis for disagreement among scholars and of course any male can revert to the argument that the Quran must be taken literally if confronted with revisionism or ‘liberal interpretations’. After all the Quran is Gods word.\nSo far nothing remotely controversial has been said. Many Muslims would agree with some or all of what has been referred to above. Maybe some might challenge us on Gabriel’s first-century assertion that Jesus was the Son of God (rather than just another prophet) who preceded Mohammed.\nThe main challenge for Islamic Scholars is to persuade us in the 21st-century that the vision of social and economic perfection based on the Quran and Hadith, can improve human existence. They also need to explain why women should accept as a sex their deficiency. or Homosexuals should accept being punished in the name of God.\nIslam is only perfect in theory. No one has ever made Islam perfect in reality. Notwithstanding this, Islam is the perfect ideology with which to attack others for being ‘different’ and therefore ungodly. It is hard to imagine gaining many followers if Islam’s expectations about human behaviour are so unrepresentative of people and their more enlightened expectations even in 21st-century Islamic countries.\nHaving highlighted some uncontroversial observations about Islam which many Muslims would accept, it is time to consider why Islam escapes serious scrutiny, when it is clear that scrutiny is simply asking Islamic scholars to explain Islamic doctrine and justify Islamic law in the context of the enlightened 21st-century. The problem really is not about Islam but about a form of inverted racism practised by a misguided liberal establishment that prevents proper scrutiny of Islam and it’s doctrines. We call this bourgeois racism. It is the racism of the well-intended but anxious elite.\nIslam as we have said has some uncompromising attitudes which are clearly out of step with modern progressive values. The problem for the elite however is that they have a superficial understanding of Islam which is shaped by how Islam is presented to non-believers by the Islamic community. It is also influenced by fear of racism.\nStarting with ignorance. The liberal mind has become shaped by concepts like moral relativity. ‘Relativity’ is fine when one is doing one’s schoolwork on Islam and one compares church with Mosque or Zakat with Charity or maybe, look at rituals like fasting in Lent and fasting at Ramadan. So, the idea in the consciousness of the modern liberal is that Islam is like other religions, it has its ‘divine narrative’, which they would reject as fanciful nonsense, as they do with Christianity. But, and it is a big but, to the liberal, Islam is exclusively practised by people with a darker skin colour so to criticise Islam is like racism and against the liberal ideology of being ‘welcoming’ and ‘inclusive’.\nThis conflation of religion and skin colour has become so established that Islamicists have taken to associating criticism of Islam with a ‘kind of racism’. The upshot of this confusion about Islamic ideas and the association of Islam with race is that there is perceived by the BBC or other liberal organisations to be no problem with Islam. Any ‘problem’ is not a problem at all, its racism.\nThe consciousness of the traditional Muslim whilst at odds with much western thinking should in the 21st-century be open to robust challenge. But it is not! Many are happy to believe in the Quran and Hadith and see in Islam a God-ordained antidote to western secularism. Any difficulty secularists and non-believers face challenging Islam are therefore caused by an ignorant, patronising smug bourgeois elite treating Muslims as potential victims of ‘racial’ abuse, if anyone says anything bad about their faith of Islam.\nSo, what is the answer? Well in classical Marxist terms religion reflects various stages in the development of human consciousness. The consciousness associated with twenty-first-century western enlightenment cannot be passed over as an irrelevance whilst one fetishizes belief systems and codes of morality based on first or seventh-century ideas. To do so is dangerous. Dangerous because its too easy to slide back to where you have been rather than progress to an uncertain and maybe more equal, less faith-based and therefore less elitist future. Open and respectful dialogue with people who stand up for their belief system whatever it is is essential. As is an end to seeing Islam race-based. Islam is no more raced based than say socialism. Ideas are not racial but people are.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_are-you-a-marxist-worker-or-part-of-the-liberal-identity-left-we-redefine-left-wing-politics/content_137.html": "Marxism and 21st Century working people: friend or foe?\nMarxism in the twenty-first century: should we all be Marxists now?\nWe are ordinary people who would like to express an opinion and hopefully tilt politics in favour of ordinary working individuals.\nAs a solution to the political and social difficulties faced by nations within the western free market system (we avoid the term capitalism because capitalism involves a form of exploitative economic self-regulation not seen since the early twentieth century) the so-called political Left have discovered an audience which includes old socialists, minority groups and some of the disgruntled and indebted young. Often this traditional Left self-refer to Karl Marx or Marxism which guilds their ideas with a radical legitimacy. We would like to encourage politicians and journalists to avoid giving this traditional Left the endorsement of ‘Marxism’. They are undeserving of it and equally, it serves to polarise debate around the socialism versus capitalism narrative. This narrative is not relevant anymore but the implications of imposing twentieth-century socialist economics would be as catastrophic on the nation as re-adopting the exploiting self-regulation of nineteenth-century capitalism.\nKarl Marx was as we are sure you know a political philosopher. His economics has over the last one hundred and fifty years become largely irrelevant. That said the concept of justice enshrined in all his writing has never been properly understood by the Left leaving a legacy of murder, destroyed lives and economies at the hands of false prophets and egotists, as Marx himself might have put it.\nMarx recognised that human beings have species essence, the ability to plan and co-operate in pursuit of the survival of our species. The energy used which he called labour power eventually becoming mastered by various elites enabling them to enrich themselves at the people’s expense. The combination of economic reality and concocted legitimacy in institutions like the Church enabled wealthy elites to maintain their privilege because economic reality formed the basis for people’s consciousness making certain values and expectations legitimate. Eventually, however, consciousness matures until in Marx’s words the power imbalances or contradictions finally burst the economic system asunder. This is Marx’s explanation for revolution. The word privilege has been erroneously adopted as a term of class derision by the traditional Left without them fully understanding its origin or their own Parliamentary Party based privilege today.\nIn the twenty-first century, we must view our consciousness as working people within the context of a new economic reality. The global free market. In Britain, this economic reality underpins an essentially eighteenth-century political and public sector built by capitalism to promote the interests of capitalists. The bourgeoisie as Marx called them. Applying Marx’s notion of contradictions, it is, we argue, possible to view the state and the political and legal system as trying to restrain the kind of changed consciousness (one of equality and fairness) that is emerging within western working communities and they are thus creating the very contradictions that if suppressed give rise to violent revolution. The political system is doing this, and it applies as much to the left as the right, to protect privilege and power, just as it was set up to do.\nBecause the political system and its legal and state-ordered elements like local authorities can’t seem to adapt to the pressure from working people for more political involvement and fairness, they adopt several approaches a couple of which in conclusion we will explore here. The most obvious result of the state feeling the power of the people but being unwilling to yield real power to us is to offer policies that appease. ‘If people want fairness, we will give them fairness….in fact, we will ram it down their throats’ you can hear politicians saying from Tony Blair to Teresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. But this fairness is not based on mass consciousness it is based simply on the guilty conscience of the elite. Delivered from the top by politicians in their party based political ivory tower and endorsed by celebrities and people with financial privilege, it is seen by the working people for what it is, patronising political correctness. Arrogant meddling in the realities of working people. It’s not a real desire to politically empower working people but an excuse to ram home concocted fairness out of a guilty conscience rather than yield to the class consciousness of working people and open political power to the many, not the few. The political class fear people power as we would restrict their power and bring fairness to tax-payed funded public bodies like Parliament and the BBC.\nTo differentiate consciousness from a guilty conscience we offer an example. Teresa May, Emma Thompson, Emily Thornberry or Seamus Milne might be concerned about the fact that there are poorer people than them and want the state to do something about it. That is a bourgeois guilty conscience. They will be unable to comprehend however that there is unfairness in a system that makes them so much richer and more powerful than us and that needs dealing with too. That is working class consciousness.\nOne final observation and that is that in the absence of systems that actually do empower people, people will have no option but to vote for the goofball who best enshrines their view that politicians need taking down a peg or two. The Farage phenomenon created by the BBC as a foil for serious politicians like Blair and Cameron backfired because people no longer need a Cameron or a Blair. People want more political power. Trump is a product of the same phenomenon in the U.S. People are stuck with a political system that excludes them from power. The same phenomenon afflicts France and the EU in general.\nPeople don’t want the guilt-based conscience of the Left and celebs pushing political correctness or the goofball guilt free politics of the right promoting Trump and a variety of other populists. People who in a truly Marxist sense have a raised collective consciousness for fairness and equality now want to have power. Power to the people.\nPoliticians on the traditional left and on the right need to understand that political change is in the air. Working people have good humane values and don’t need to be hectored by an expensive state run by privileged political parties. Making global corporations pay their way and reducing personal debts, will also empower working people. We want the freedom and choice of the free market reflected in our politics. That isn’t happening because the bourgeoisie of the political left and right don’t want to give up their eighteenth-century class privilege.\nBlue Revolution. For the People, not the Party",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_mrs-may-is-a-thoroughly-modern-girl-if-it-were-1978-but-what-about-now/content_303.html": "Mrs May is a thoroughly modern girl if it were 1978 but what about now?\n“She’s so 20th century, she’s so 1970’s she knows the right things to say she knows the right clothes to wear coz she’s a modern girl oh yeah”. Bob Geldoff somehow caught the spirit of Mrs May back in 1978 and after the one nation One Show sofa saga it seems opportune to remind ourselves that modern politics is currently being cast in the past, the 1970’s for both Mr Corbyn and Mrs May. We would suggest a little earlier for Mr Corbyn, perhaps 1973 to Mrs Mays 1976. In any event, we are experiencing politics which is clearly forty years out of date. Brexit which should be understood by all as a liberation from the yoke of an oppressive and tax gobbling overlord is seen by many an opportunity to renegotiate on the basis of a 1970’s EEC-type iteration of the EU. Not wholly bad but again a bit 1970’s.\nThe problem with the EU and its component parts is that it is manifestly inefficient like a middle-aged man living comfortably off a credit card with a huge credit limit but who’s income always seems to fall a little short of expenditure each month “old boy!”. As a result of this predictable long-term terminal decline we have a duty to not just to try to negotiate a safe 1970’s EEC style deal, if indeed we get that, we still might get nothing, but we should also be a critical friend to the countries of the EU. Like the disassociation that exists between the parliamentary system in the UK and the people who pay for, it the EU is not hugely popular with many ordinary Europeans. Like the Brits with Brexit, most EU citizens understand the EU doesn’t pass the sniff test but they are powerless to deal with it as no mainstream party wants to come on board. Like Clegg and Cameron, the mainstream continental parties see the EU as an exciting place to waffle, shuffle paper, and make a lot of money from somewhere. Macron is like that too so all the best to France. So we should stop being so 1970’s in our dealings with the EU and help the EU reach a position of sane self-awareness.\nThe EU is a continental sized liability a few short watery miles away and we are not living in 1976. The threat of the EU is enormous not as a warrior but as an unstable and unsustainable economic behemoth. A rendering back of power to nations states with an EEC style deal for all of the countries of the EU would at least offer the prospect of a controlled implosion when it finally comes. As it is we are facing at some point the collapse of a bloated arrogant and self-deluded pseudo-nation state with all the horrendous economic and social consequences its collapse will inflict on both them and us.\nIt is not good being too 1970’s about this, Mrs May needs to understand that it’s not just what you wear and what you say…..it’s what you think that matters and in what decade you think it!!",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-05-05-15-to-07-09-15/content_42.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 05.05.15 to 07.09.15\n05.05.15 British Labour Candidates at Muslim segregated event; is there an issue here?\nWell for all the talk of “diversity” that took place during the period under “New Labour” the ability to mix it up as a celebration of diversity seems to have failed to reach certain elements within the Muslim community and certain rather silly Labour candidates. Here at Blue Revolution are full on advocates of diversity but also extend a critical eye when certain practices remain fixed or fetishized in the 21st century. So, what do we make of this segregated event? Well firstly if this faith group choose to exclude gender mixing that is up to them. A gentle way of showing that there is respect for both sexes and more importantly trust between them has been missed. What is particularly odd however is the attendance at this event of male Labour party candidates who by attending “uncritically” have reinforced and endorsed the idea that the sexes should be kept apart.\nAs we have said in the past all culture is about survival and faith forms the most -important part of culture; so, at some point in the past it was both rational and “normal” to separate the sexes. This would have had its origins in the obvious differential roles played by men and women in societies that struggled to create the value necessary to guarantee the future of the tribe or kingdom. The women’s social role would have precluded them from any economic or military role and so separation would have been an obvious reflection of this rational situation. However today we create value; social and economic by our ability to collaborate not differentiate. By attending this event the Labour candidates were endorsing a view of the world that is as far from “diversity” as it is possible to get; Clearly, they are not very bright.\nThe Blue Revolution, view is that there is no place for this kind of separation not just in the Uk….as Nigel Farage suggested but anywhere in the word. The world will not start to generate the real levels of social and economic value necessary for us to survive in the 21st century and beyond if we adopt the cultural practices of the past. Value both social and economic in the modern world needs equality and there is no place for reinforcing the notion of irrational difference. Our view is that the Labour MP’s should have explained this position and if their views were considered too “modern” they should have politely refused to attend. Clearly the group of men were not only economically and socially illiterate; they are no great fans of women either.\n10.05.15 Sin Number two: Objectification\nWe hear the word objectification used by some commentators specifically in respect of women; the ease with which men resort to treating women as objects to be ogled at treated not as people but as things. Pornography being the most obvious manifestation of this process. This is the standard version of objectification and as you would expect here at Blue Revolution we can understand the motivation for this and the upsetting consequences for the person on the receiving end. However, this Male objectifying of women is essentially a western problem as women are freer to be objectified as our concept of modesty has been largely abandoned by those who wish to abandon it.\nMankind has always sought out the most beautiful and strongest mates as they have the highest value. Wolf whistling and mild pornography are rather silly modern by-products of this process, essentially tolerable if one wants to promote and protect freedom; particularly women’s freedom. Whilst it is unacceptable even at its lowest level, it is largely harmless. Women of course also engage in objectifying men as any middle-aged bald man in a bar will attest when he has the temerity to speak to any young female. The “Mr Darcy” effect applies to attractive men too. Objectification at this level is pretty gender neutral.\nOf course, seeking out the best mate being a “timeless practice” intended to promote the survival of the fittest it will have manifestations and controls in many cultures that exist today. The most obvious examples are head and face veiling in which the woman is rendered unseen as anything other than an object defined only by gender. This happens to varying degrees. Objectified by the requirements of her culture; the aim to avoid the lustful glances of men with whom she is not allowed to have any contact, to protect her virtue and in some cultures her life. This objectification can cause some very mixed opinions in western culture, but few people see it as “objectification”; more an expression of cultural or faith-based difference, and therefore there are several opinions about how one should react to it. However, when woman is objectified in this way it denies the culture the freedom to be creative and to generate value via inter gender trust and co-operation and it reflects suspicion between the sexes that requires control by male hegemony.\nThe most prevalent of objectification is everywhere and is silent and unseen; it never announces itself; far from it is never acknowledged. It is the objectification we do to ourselves; be we pumped-up muscle-bound jocks or the naked girls pleading for trade in the windows of a brothel in Amsterdam or on “Babe Station”. It is the preening look at me way certain people make themselves look to attract others; making objects of themselves. They are playing on the fact that we have the timeless practice of seeking out beauty and strength and they want to be the one that picks up the accolade of being objectified as often and as frequently as possible but only with someone who is worthy enough to reflect the objectified value they see in themselves. For some people being objectified generates positive feelings and hence the craving to be it and receive it may continue beyond the point where a mate is chosen, and children born, and it probably contributes the most to jealousy and relationship problems. That is why it is my second most serious deadly sin. Pornography, sexual crime, child abuse war and discrimination also have their origins in Objectification as does the rush to punish harshly or publicly humiliate.\nHowever, it is the casual thoughtless objectifications that adversely affect western society the most at the social level. So much harm is done when people express their needs either by objectifying others, or objectifying themselves, and in numbers too large to avoid moral catastrophe. To survive a society needs stability and higher moral purpose. We at Blue Revolution often think that objectification is what in many relationships passes as love.\nTo avoid Objectifying people we need to learn to treat all people as subjects and accord them the status of people with moods, thoughts, intellect, and feelings rather than objects to be looked at and despised or admired. Objectification be it via cloaking in a shrouding garment or viewing as objects for titillation is unhelpful to spiritual growth and proper economic value growth and we should not do it to ourselves or others.\n19.05 15 Refugees are a problem of value versus wealth\nRefugees and desperate migrants are a sad spectacle crammed in boats and dragged from port to port in Indonesia or often drowning in the Mediterranean if they are not successful in making shore in Italy. The current solution is to hand wring and accept them into the countries they are trying to get to. This is the only solution to date but at Blue Revolution we believe we need to look at the causes as these may guide the solution. In Indonesia the cause is discrimination which is a social value limiting modern day travesty of natural justice. Value as we at Blue Revolution assert all the time, is that product which a person or state creates, and which is necessary to support and sustain its population. The more value created the wealthier the country. Value is manifest in two ways; social value which is how well people function together and how little economic value is consumed in achieving this. Social Value in democracies should be social stability based on Contract, Choice, Consent, Freedom Democracy for example. However, these often abused for selfish personal gain, so a lot of economic value is consumed “correcting” the undesirable outcomes, divorce, crime, delinquency for example. In some other cultures social value is based on rules, obedience, submission and harsh punishments from government down to the family unit. But to create what little value these countries can; stability has to be imposed as opposed to consented to.\nWith social value comes the context to create economic value and from this process we generate wealth. This can be created in the form of manufactured goods; produced as harvested food, or simply pumped out of the ground in the form of oil and gas.\nRefugees are a product of the host country, be it Libya or Minamar failing to create the stable social context with enough social value to enable individuals to create the economic value necessary to support the country and its population. This comes about due to war corruption and incompetence. The solution therefore is to help the countries in difficulty provide the basic stability necessary to enable people to begin the process of creating economic value and thereby create the incentive to stay where they are. Even if this arrangement is less than democratic, as long as it is contract and consent based the democracy can come later. The EU could do this as the EU is well placed by proximity to North Africa to offer a social and economic model which is a little short of democratic but which could offer countries like Libya some “scrutiny” and economic support and therefore the stability to begin unleashing the economic potential of its people.\nThe paradox of the refugee situation is of course the All-Faiths-and-None old chestnut of the relative lack of overall social value in the west (governments now operate where social value once held sway and what a mess it is under the glitz and gloss) and the tendency for refugees to travel to a so called wealthy country which has a social morality which shocks and alarms them and leads to alienation, suspicion and mistrust. In the west, in all honesty, economic value is much lower than the wealth created with it, this apparent wealth too, acts as a draw for migrants. If we want to help solve the migrant issue therefore, we must improve the levels of social value in the west whilst increasing the levels of economic value in the countries that lack it. Over to someone!\n23.05.15 Sin number three: prejudice\nPrejudice is a very simple concept to understand but achieves the status of a modern sin by virtue of its role promoting the previous two Sins; cruelty and objectification. Many of us have been guilty of casually cussing at groups; single mothers, foreign people living in our communities, people of different faiths to our faith, or people with no faith at all. Prejudice is looking through the person and not seeing the individual. It is a limited and narrow-minded way of understanding a group or having a conversation about different groups of people without acknowledging they have differences and individual elements of uniqueness including rights which they can exercise. However, when prejudice runs out of control in the hearts of people of faith and no faith it becomes a frightening phenomenon indeed. The whole phenomenon of Nazi Germany would have started with casual prejudice against Jewish people or Gay people and was corralled by the Nazi propaganda machine into a cruel and objectifying ideology that whipped up into mass support. The Nazi’s could not have made progress without population familiar with casual prejudice. In Great Britain there is a tendency to be prejudiced against individuals particularly Eastern Europeans and this is encouraged by some political parties. The issue of migration does not go away, but it is important that the debate is not driven by prejudice.\nToday we see casual prejudice everywhere; different religions harbour prejudice against their faith “rivals”; ISIS have a whole creed built on prejudice; they however have, like the Nazis weaponized their prejudice and given the availability of money to support them they are able to turn prejudice into a cruel and barbaric ideology. We must all be on our guard for prejudice in our own treatment of people and our thoughts about them. That said there are debates to be had about important issues such as migration; radicalisation; western culture, welfare etc, however we don’t have to treat individual people who may share some of these characteristics as an exemplar of our particular issue and be prejudiced against them for it. Because prejudice feeds objectification and cruelty it is my third modern deadly sin.\n31.05.15 Hot Feminist- a view from Blue Revolution\nWe have recently been made aware of a book called “Hot Feminist” written we guess by a self-declared “hot feminist”. The redeeming characteristic of this book is that it encourages women to be loyal to one another and not engage in the kind of woman on woman character assassination that so many women tell us blights their lives; and this is particularly so in respect of insecure and vulnerable younger girls. However, with that bit of positive woo out of the way what are we to make of a book that tells women to ignore the “rules” of feminism and embrace sexiness and self-promotion.\nHaving only recently written about the corrosive effects of objectification we were amazed to find that here was a book promoting our second most deadly modern sin. Sexiness is important to men and to women; it is the way we attract a mate so that we can move from the sphere of singledom and its limiting social and economic value creation to the realm of coupledom with the possible expectation that our roles will be merged or will morph to allow us to bring a child or two into the world; a secure world of certainty and the absence of unnecessary contingency and risk. What the “Hot Feminist” advocates however is a form of self-objectified narcissism. The “old feminists” with their tribal rules warned against the objectification of women by men….and rightly so. The modern “Hot Feminist” wants to get in first; objectify herself and be the sexy one in the workplace as well as the bedroom. How exactly we ask can this total act of self-absorption assist society in its job of bringing up well balanced children and particularly girls. “Hot feminists” will almost certainly wish to attract otherwise committed men and potentially undermine the family (not intentionally perhaps but by default). Alternatively, they will tire of the man who doesn’t salivate whenever they purr into the room. They will make other women jealous and angry and even more importantly they will set themselves a very high bench mark for their own psychological gratification which will be fine as long as they are young and attractive or in respect of the many relationships being “Hot” is likely to lead to, compliant with the demands of the men they seek to be involved with and whose role is to reinforce their self-perception as “Hot”. As they get older dissatisfaction with life and looks will set in (it does for us all) and may possibly lead to depression and loneliness as well as Botox and plastic surgery for those who can afford it. Such nonsense as the “Hot Feminist” peddles undermines the most impressionable women in their longer term by filling their heads with rubbish in the short term and has no place in a society which desperately needs to address a shortage of solid social values (loyalty, modesty, chastity, selfrestraint even politeness etc) if it is ever going to stop wasting hard borrowed economic value to pay for government initiatives in health and welfare that plaster over the social cracks that make modern society lonely and uncertain and for the young and vulnerable a fairly psychologically toxic place to grow up……..something we think the “Hot Feminist” needs to do; and before she settles down and has children.\n11.06.15 Girl bares breasts in Malaysia and goes to prison – nothing sums the worlds moral contradictions better\nA young woman and a few friends get naked in Malaysia…apparently triggering an earthquake and end up in prison. Nothing sums up the sad state of modern world morality better than this rather strange tale. For the Malaysians we at All-Faiths-and -None ask “What” are you serious! However, whilst the “earthquake element” is probably a bit of casual tabloid sub contextualized racism the point for the west to consider is why is it considered so Ok or indeed normal to behave in this way. Nakedness because of its association with sex and reproductive intimacy immediately causes one to forget the person and concentrate on the sexual object when seen out of an intimate context. This is bad enough but on a mountain, with friends it clearly falls outside the context of intimate behaviour occurring within an environment where intimacy should take place. In the west nakedness, sex and stimulation are seen as goods, products to be pursued and even traded with no concept of the consequences; be those consequences “offending the gods” or getting pregnant with a child neither parent really wants.\n29.06.15 Tunisian Beach Massacre-Do we really understand this war on our way of life.\nFrom the slightly ridiculous “breasts on the mountain” conflict between the East and Western culture we have another far more tragedy with 36 people dead on a holiday beach. Again, the politician’s response is correctly to identify this as a war on our way of life; criminals identified with Islam shooting half naked holiday makers on a beach. The Prime Minister of Britain comments that it is a challenge to our democracy peace and tolerance”. At A-Faiths-a-none we believe a slightly different direction needs to be taken in respect of this debate. We saw with Charlie Hebdo that our desire to poke the wasps nest ends up causing a loss of life often more than one life at that and always more than the mild provocation merited or could ever justify. But still it goes on.\n“Islam is a religion of peace”, all faiths have promoted themselves as religions of peace; but until comparatively recently this peace applied to “believers” only. As we have said before faith helps bring stability to groups of people be they family, country, or empire. Faith removes the uncertainty and fear that would make civilisation impossible. Islamic “civilisation” was a place of rules and strict punishments that worked when a society was eking out a living in a dust bowl or an area of economic and social uncertainty. These Islamic rules of civilisation are no longer needed by the western societies. We don’t need to make the world “gendered” and discriminatory. We have through welfare and economic growth all but removed economic insecurity. However, in doing this we have created a social world in which common place rules of Islam are flouted at every turn. Immodesty being one obvious one but also the abandonment of the family to a make it up as you go along lifestyle. We don’t want to go over all the issues here but perhaps the real problem between the west and Islam is similar to the conflict of beliefs between the unconstrained secular world (the world of porn, over consumption, social uncertainty and valueless wealth creation) and the beliefs of those of faith….any faith and those with a secular morality which puts the long term ahead of immediate need for gratification; that is one of lifestyle. To a simple Muslim way of thinking our high levels of “immorality” renders our way of live unsustainable; and ready to be brought down.\nPerhaps our western societies with our lack of collective moral identity and behaviour in respect of so much of what extremist Islam is still obsessing about, is our main weakness. Perhaps we should accept that what we do and the way we do it, promote it and brook no dissension that it is “liberating” for us all, is a problem. If we don’t get this right soon, we will for very many in the world confuse with immorality with democracy; a very much unintended consequence. By seeking a wider debate with those of all faiths and none we might understand a little better why the “western lifestyle” is hated by a growing number of people in the world……before it is too late.\n03.07.15 The Left and the cause of the confusion over faith race and extremism\nWe have commented on this topic before and suggested that any attempt to segregate the sexes is a romantic throwback to an era and culture when segregation was more a fact of hard economics than a fetishized behaviour by zealots which cannot capture or promote the way modern society either should do or needs to operate.\nHowever, the topic does not go away due to the link all things gender related have with “extremism” and the apparent sympathetic view taken towards those who peddle gender discrimination, perversely get from the British left; particularly the student left. All-faiths-and-none being both faith based and Darwinian always view the opinions of the young as generally a little ill-informed as their views are generally not based on tried and trusted social or economic progressive models but on the need to experiment with some daft ideas and theoretical concepts which offend parents in particular but any authority in general. However whilst most youthful opinion is generally seen as harmless and indeed “progressive”…evolutionary if you like…sympathy with segregation is most definitely devolutionary and harmful to society in general and women in particular; giving modern western women the taste of an era and culture where women were routinely segregated out of economic and social necessity. This really hasn’t happened in western cultures for thousands of years and certainly not on the grand scale you see in the modern Middle East even now. So what is really going on, is the student left is supporting a form of cultural imperialism, demanded by Islamic cultural extremists, that has no and never has had any connection with the culture of the west…..probably but they are too ill informed to know that. Is that a problem…..well no if segregation is not forced on the unwilling and is understood as being both an irrelevant and discriminatory practice that is alien to the West and counter-productive in terms of enhancing social and economic value but yes if somehow it is enforced and used to try and undermine the wests attempts to preserve freedom and equality.\nTo preserve and promote a culture based on gender discrimination you have to undermine any society and its economy if it is based on freedom and choice, contract and consent. The student British left are like the man sawing off the branch of the tree he is sitting on. Beware of what you wish for guys ……the girls may never forgive you.\n08.07.15 To counter the pessimism of Tony Blair let us explore “Secular Westernism” as a cause of terrorism\nTerrorism is not inevitable; it is caused and fuelled by ideological and religious forces with only the very fringes objecting to democracy, freedom and equality. However, a far larger group of the faithful of many faiths object to the culture of what we at Blue Revolution call “Western Secularism”. The interpretation of secularism peculiar to the west which has perverted most of what is essentially good about western culture, good which is inherent within the wests “free market” systems (consent, choice and contract). We call it Secular Westernism, as opposed to say Chinese secularism, simply because they are very different, have different influences and radically different outcomes.\nWhat we argue is this; that the faith community and those Darwinians who promote the concept of the long term survival of the most able and adaptable societies, dislike the outcomes of Secular Westernism and the combination of unrestrained moral freedom and the free market effectively marketizing areas that were once managed on a personal level by individuals making pro social moral choices. This was most often based on a belief in the preservation of social value (community, the family etc), all-be-that in the past, supported by religious faith. Today too many people enjoy unrestrained personal excess as the expense of the State, the community, the family and indeed their own good health and moral hygiene and have no concept of wider moral values beyond their own immediate freedoms and needs.\nSo, let us not pretend there is no solution to the problem of terrorism and religious intolerance. That is true if you are as Tony Blair arguably is, the high priest of Western Secularism…….but not if you believe as we do that there is an alternative in the form of encouraging a new wide spread moral revolution…..as we call it; the Blue Revolution.\n11.07.15 The Next Modern Deadly Sin-Number 4; Breach of Trust\nThis one is relatively simple to explain but breach of it can be devastating as it applies to situations where there is an expectation of trust such as a workplace or as in our “Sin” a relationship. What should we make of a society where many; perhaps too many intimate relationships fail out of complacency or boredom and the people in those relationships deceitfully seek comfort elsewhere?\nOf course, relationships should end when there is violence or cruelty and ending it is the best option for all parties. However, we have looked at “objectification” as a sin and where this exists there is pressure to move to a more adoring partner or seek more excitement. This often happens deceitfully as no one wants to be breaching trust and therefor being essentially dishonest. We have therefore built breach of trust into the normal expectation of relationships and as relationships are the building blocks of society, so we have built it into the wider expectations of society. No society can thrive with dishonesty “downloaded” into its informal social structure and in the west, we survive because the moral jeopardy associated with relationship dishonesty is largely met by governments.\nBreach of trust in relationships is a “sin”, it damages people and families it undermines communities and so widespread is it, that one could claim it is a part of the Secular Western culture we describe as “Secular Westernism”, as described in the last posting. To avoid “breaching trust” within the no faiths secular community, failing relationships should be consciously uncoupled or ended with respect on both sides, and both parties move on in the knowledge that no dishonesty has taken place. Hopefully without children. However in respect of the faith communities we would support the view that a relationship failure should be avoided and care should be taken to ensure faith based friendship is the key stone of the relationship rather than money, looks, narcissism, or objectification rendering it a short term arrangement at the outset. The term Secular Westernism really sums up the values totality of the western world with all its marvels of freedom, choice, consent, contract but with the downside of our “seven deadly sins” letting the side down and antagonizing too many people of faith. More sins to follow.\n20.07.15 ISIS are not the same as religious extremists; David Cameron needs to understand the difference\nAs we have said in the past ISIS are simply criminals; people who destroy value or impede the creation of value are criminals and the evidence of this seeps out of ISIS controlled areas daily. Brutality and destruction, fear and hatred provide no framework for creating the economic value and wealth necessary to support a population. But ISIS don’t care because they don’t understand economics and if they did, they would probably regard brutality as the only way to run, what we at A-F-a N call a dust bowl economy. A dust bowl economy for those unfamiliar with the term is any economy where economic value is not created by diverse human endeavour either because such value either doesn’t exist even in the raw form of primary resources (as in ISIS territory) or is simply pumped out of the ground by industrial processes whilst the wealth extracted props up an oppressive feudal system.\nI hope you can see where we might be going with this.\nAnyway, David Cameron the British PM wants to tackle extremists when what we suspect he means are either violent extremists or better still Criminals identifying themselves as Muslims. The culture of Westernism is confused about Islam; as it is about all faiths, having abandoned faith-based morality, in favour of a now failing secular model of morality based around consumption as opposed to production. This happened sometime after the Second World War. We believe the “driver” for this was the belief that politics could deliver what Christian faith would or could not, namely “equality”. But an apparent equality to consume is not the same as real political equality, a point we will I am sure develop over the next few years.\nAs with Marxism the prevailing post war view was that religion was the opium of the people. Holding back the desire for political and economic equality. There was at that time as now the basic principles of contract, choice and consent; the building blocks of freedom and democracy, but these were, it was argued, not delivering “equality” thus this equality was not available to all. Women, and those who’s sexuality was not heterosexual were penalised and the poor and working classes were seen as having limited economic choices, so the religious morality underpinning Christian Westernism had to go. The point that was missed though was that Christian morality was more about ensuring economic stability to produce rather than as now creating economic conditions to consume. The point however is that the culture back the was very different from today’s culture even though we had the same core principals the social outcomes were vastly different.\nSo, what you may ask has this got to do with extremism. Well back before the rise of Secular Westernism we imprisoned gay people, women had unequal pay and a Christian wife was expected to give way in all things to her husband. Rape was not illegal in marriage and an establishment ran things their way with their morality designed to protect them and preserve their little peccadilloes. Sounds to me like the views of extremists and all of that apparently (if not actually) supported by state religion; Christian religion. These were extremist times, but they were not violent extremist times. And the non-violent extremists are still out there; many Muslims like their devout Christian compatriots have strident views about sexual morality, women’s rights, welfare, marriage, abortion and so on and so forth. They have views about modesty, adultery and illegitimacy but it doesn’t make them want to go out and bomb, mutilate and stone people (even though some might argue for this). Extremist Muslims are just one group of the very devout who don’t like Secular Westernism, but they must not be confused with the criminals and violent extremists who are ISIS and want to destroy it. They must also not be identified as people who threaten the West’s culture of freedom and democracy based as it is on Contract Choice and Consent because, like the West, they can enjoy wealth created by the economic value available within our diverse society and with choice and consent they can practice their faith as they see fit. What they are quite right to do; as we at Blue Revolution do and that is look at the positives that Secular Westernism has delivered…..but also look at how by opting out of faith based morality altogether Western Secularism has creates a moral context which offends very many faith communities and not just Muslims. David Cameron understands this but like the secularised Church of England……he doesn’t I suspect want to be seen to do morality!\nDisliking Secular Westernism now that it has gone too far from being overtly moral in character is no proof of criminality any more than seeing Saudi Arabia as a brutal and oppressive throwback to the moral Dark Ages makes you a racist or cultural imperialist. Strong moral views are good, irrespective of how much someone may loath them…….enforcing them on others with violence is criminal and should be treated as such.\n26.07.15 British Lib Dem equivocates over homosexuality- is this Ok we ask?\nTim Farron the Lib Dem leader who is a Christian is evasive about homosexuality. The British left wing is now on a mission to “out” him as an intolerant bigot so the public can be reassured that morality in safe in the hands of the British Left and the “Guardian” reading intellectuals. We at Blue Revolution say what rot. The mischief here is that in the realm of opinion as opposed to behaviour Mr Farron cannot hold a moral position without being taken to task and effectively “closed down”. The role of religion has become so removed from Western culture in all but a few symbolic relics such as “Presidential Oath of Office” in the US or in GB the State opening of Parliament etc it is now seen as irrelevant; unless of course its views conflict with those of the oh so right on morally muddled Left Wing.\nWhat gives the British Left the right to close down someone’s argument simply because they have private views that they, the left wing doesn’t like. Mr Farron would we are sure bear no malice towards gay people, he would we are sure afford them respect and the right to live their life as they see fit. However, he may not identify this lifestyle as one that morally fits into his framework of reference as he is a Christian. If you ask the young men coming out of Mosques their opinions, they may agree with Mr Farron but unlike the Christian many may express harder opinions perhaps including punishment for Gay people.\nThe left of course fails to see that any faith or moral opinion that does not wholeheartedly support homosexuality, is not necessarily un-accepting of that different lifestyle. We at Blue Revolution do not support adultery as a lifestyle choice, but we don’t think people who are adulterous should be punished. And so, I am sure it is with Mr Farron and his views on homosexuality. The real sadness in this story is that the collectivist Left long associated with despotism and intolerance, for those who don’t concede to their dogma, are at it again, peddling intolerance and stupidity. There is more similarity between the modus operandi of the left wing and the regimes of Saudi Arabia and The Peoples Republic of China than there is between Mr Farron the British left or these ghastly regimes. He needs to openly uphold the right to have moral opinions which differs from that of the Left, and by implication much of mainstream Secular Westernism. By doing this he will be allowing people (Christian and Muslim alike) to experience moral disagreement within a free society which promotes peaceful acceptance of all beliefs within the rule of law. Something the left wing has never really “got”.\n01.08.15 Migrants in Calais-what does a coherent response look like; the Blue Revolution view\nThe BBC sympathises, or appears to, the left criticizes the language used to describe the migrants, “swarms” for example, the French want rid of them and the British don’t want them so they try and keep them in France. The British Army may be mobilised; but what is really going to sort out this long- term global problem. In reality the problem can and will get worse; and it is a bad problem because whilst the human rights lobby see this as a simple an easy enough to fix humanitarian crisis and extend concern, understanding and a home in the UK, the crisis is essentially an economic, cultural and moral crisis and is best understood as such.\nAs we at Blue Revolution continually say; faith and culture are and should be intrinsically tied up with the creation of value both social and financial, out of which a society can support its population; faith or lack of it can promote or hinder this process. In the west value both social and economic is created by the diverse interplay of people of all faiths and none with an enthusiastic acceptance that, whilst we all may have different views about many things, we are on the whole united in our belief that limiting human productivity on the basis of gender race, age disability or sexuality is wrong. This is the basic culture of the west; delivered by its Christian but now largely secular heritage. There are problems however, we are too promiscuous, and our family units are unstable, we don’t manage those who fail the system very well either, so we have depression, crime and substance misuse. Plus, we have too many who commit our new “seven Deadly Sins” (some still to follow) and undermine the basic “good” in western culture.\nThere in lies the problem.\nThe Eritreans, Somalis, Sudanese, young men queuing up at Calais are not bringing with them values which we need or can realistically use, so in large numbers they will fail to deliver “value” in our complex society; be that social value or economic value. Whilst there may be exceptions to this, on the whole they will bring a set of beliefs and values that will be ideal for supporting a more traditional society of rule based morality where there are clear definitions of moral and immoral behaviour which as with all traditional societies (completely understandably by us here at Blue Revolution) relates to gender and sexuality much more so than it does in the west. They will have views which identify difference as something to be feared and therefore fought and punished. In our view this is the main misunderstanding by the “human rights lobby”. We believe it makes us look delusional in our dealings with other faiths and cultures and to some extend makes us vulnerable as a culture to being taken advantage of.\nIf the west and in particular Europe wants to deal with this crisis in a humane way they must first understand the moral background of the people who want to come here and on that basis stop being as deluded about what the migrants can offer, as the migrants are themselves. Then they should ensure that the tide of migration stops at the ports in North Africa and that the vast amounts of money wasted in supporting the EU “machine” is used to promote diverse and thriving economies in the countries of North Africa. The entrepreneurs who “swarm” here would be better using their risk taking resilience to build value of a more 21st century character into their own societies benefitting from the liberalising effects of trade, rather than coming to the west; becoming overwhelmed and angered by a culture that alienates them…..and many of us too.\nThere can be no justification for propping up a failing Bureaucracy in Europe whilst Europe as an economy is being assailed by migrants who simply become dependent on its social welfare systems and resentful of its culture and its failure to respect and absorb their more intolerant values. We all need to look more critically and objectively at what being part of different cultures actually means for both the migrant and ourselves. Of course the crisis situation in Calais is humanitarian…..but it is cultural as well, on both sides.\n05.08.15 Thought Crime, conflict and faith\nWe were thinking the other day having written a number of blogs relating to subjects such as extremism, sexuality and Immigration and the role of faith in the debate about these issues that the western world has over the last decade or so entered a period of casual but very obvious “thought crime”; whilst we believe what we have said is moderate, we experience in daily life the views of faith communities being challenged as extreme, abusive, fundamentalist for example. Words like “problematic”, “unacceptable” become ways of closing discussion and stifling the evolution of the human mind and human shared experience. This is done by ushering in a slow devolution of the human mind and spirit by limiting the topics and views one can express in the political or public sphere. The two words above are the opposites of acceptance and understanding, particularly when the prefix is “that is” and the suffix is “to me”. This elevates silencing debate to a level of emotional manipulation which is at odds with an open society and, as during the New Labour years, is a way of deliberately closing debate, then done under the banner of “diversity” to “protect” “vulnerable groups”. Protection is the least likely outcome. The effect is that such tactics simply send the controversial discussions underground and as a result makes the public feel alienated and angry. We have seen this within working class communities with the whole issue of the EU and immigration and within other communities it manifests itself in a deep dislike of the “decadent” culture of Secular Westernism. Don’t stifle debate whatever the topic…..\n08.08.15 What price Love- Kids Company and the bean counters\nCamilla Batmanghelidjh the articulate and eccentric head of Kids Company (KC) managed to get philanthropists and Prime Ministers to part with large sums of their own and tax-payers money to support her project offering hope to inner city Kids. The main issue seems to be she claimed KC were helping tens of thousands of children, yet the evidence indicated numbers in the mid to late hundreds. Another issue seems to be that envelopes of cash were being given to kids with no accountability as to how the money was being spent. From the Blue Revolution perspective there are two things which are relevant to this story. The first is that Camilla Batmanghelidjh and I am sure the salaried people who worked for KC loved the children they worked with. The evident chaos and mismanagement criticised by Civil Servants would happily reflect the environment of the big loving family so evident in the past but less in evidence now. Today and more so in our inner cities we produce too few loving families and too many “family units” comprising an array of characters some permanent some temporary, and the young, displaced by this arrangement end up, in South London at least, seeking love and care with people like Ms Batmanghelidjh. The second point and perhaps the keystone to the whole saga is that today in every relevant context “love means money”. The problem for Ms Batmanghelidjh is that the money was tax-payers money. How many middle-class families have very much loved, sons and daughters who need the odd £20.00 un-repayable “loan” two or three times a week.\nWe at Blue Revolution don’t know how one squares this circle, but it seems to us everyone in this story has a valid point. The problem is the valid points do not solve the puzzle of how we provide the love that is missing in a society where a component of love has unfortunately become money. Perhaps the whole thing starts; as we have said before, with people making moral choices about whether and when to have children and with whom; and when those children arrive, making the now superhuman effort to bring them up properly so they don’t lawlessly spill out onto the streets at all hours. We would then not need Ms Batmanghelidjh or the tax-payers money she is accused of wasting. However as with much of the Blue Revolution philosophy, that is not likely to happen anytime soon.\n10.08.15 Deadly Sin Number 5- Want based consumption.\nOf the Seven Modern Deadly Sins this one is the widest ranging and touches upon almost all of the subjects covered in this blog to date. It touches on philosophy, economics, theology and perhaps somewhat unexpectedly ecology. It is not the most harmful of the seven deadly sins, harmful to individuals in the short term at least, but its range is vast and over time its impact will be massive. It forms a large component of what we call “Secular Westernism”\nIn the past the culture that most people were exposed to was shaped by the needs of the economy and reflected the social reality to which the economic realities gave rise. The nomads and slash and burn economies were differentiated by the different ways’ wealth was created. Wealth being maybe a regular supply of forage or hard-won meat such as Deer. As we have said in previous posts the dust bowl economy of the Middle East was a thousand years ago a hard environment to fashion into wealth creation so the culture was hard and rigid; this was to minimise waste and avoid any dissent which might undermine the economic model in existence at the time. The accent was on production and inequality was a powerful element in ensuring the value created as high as possible. The slave society and social rank played a part in keeping the economy supplied with sufficient value to allow all but the most dissenting and troublesome to survive.\nObedience to the social norms meant personal and family or clan survival. This is the context that ISIS operate within today and the place their policy of violent destruction of western values, would like to return. At Blue Revolution we believe this desire to return to the dust bowl is so we can exist in a pure rule based moral state complete with stoning and beheadings to remind us that we live in society where Value is hard to create and they the criminals of ISIS are in charge of the production of what little value is created. The enlightenment and Christian faiths ability to adapt to it finally liberated us from the horror of this type of existence three hundred years or more ago. However, we have we believe at Blue Revolution thrown the value creating baby out with the want based consumption bath water.\nBased on the Blue Revolution analysis (should you choose to accept it) the dust bowl or fearful and meagre existence of the past is a place we have been to and not a place we should be in any hurry to return to. However, life is full of paradox and by maintaining a culture on the basis that want drives the economy rather than need, we have moved too far away from the production of value as the factor that underpins Western culture and morality. We call this Secular Westernism as it is what happens when you remove the moral rule book and allow people through millions of individual choices to drive an economy based on their personal desire to consume, when that consumption is derived not from production but from credit and overzealous Government spending and welfare programmes.\nWe all share some of the blame for the Banking crisis, for social instability and the many other sins and vices that we at Blue Revolution gather up and call Secular Westernism. As a result of these issues we produce too little economic value, too little social value and the bit that makes it look like this broken system works is want based consumption paid for by debt and the funny money of government spending. Secular Westernism is essentially a Junk Society; a high calorie confection of spending, insecurity and debt with no nourishment.\nWith production of real value as the base of the economy rather than want based consumption, people’s expectations would be more realistic. Families would hang together, as getting out of the family would not in these circumstances, lead to a widening of the income sources available for want based consumption; by freeing equity for example. Want based consumption is planet destroying; it promotes an unsustainable birth rate amongst groups who would be economically incapable of having children were the state not to step in and subsidize their offspring. More tellingly every Pound Stirling, dollar or Euro produced to meet consumption needs (predominantly via consumption debt) is driving the carbon economy more than any other single factor. A modern parable is useful here. It is about two men; one wise and one not so wise.\nThe wiseman who produced fruit in his fields sold his produce at market and made himself very wealthy. He took his wealth much of which he did not need for the support of his family and pot it in a large hole in the ground, unmarked and with the expectation he would never dig it up. His neighbour sole his fruit at market but used the money he made to buy cars and take holidays, his expectations and those of his family became set at a life style too high for the fluctuations in the harvest to support so the man borrowed to enable his lifestyle to continue. Who might you ask was kinder to the planet?\n21,08.15 Jeremy Corbyn; left wing ideology and violent Islam What does this love in tell us about all three.\nLeft wing politics; the home of supposed tolerance, is also the home of anti Semitism, trans activism and radical feminism and to varying degrees has framed policies that over the years we at Blue Revolution believe have undermined the family, the rights of fathers and children and ushered into existence a hitherto unheard of a class of people who are detached from the expectation that they should work, behave responsibly, and make some kind of social or economic contribution for the benefit of wider society.\nThe so called “under class” is a product of a welfare system shorn of moral content as it was set up by Victorian capitalists to correct short term labour market failure. Only the naïve Guardian reader or handwringing beneficiary of a salary from working within the system could possibly see this as a good system. Its bi products of this cash on demand system are divorce, promiscuity, drink, drugs and industrial scale illegitimacy and are clearly not the kinds of outcomes that any traditional rule based society would tolerate. Indeed in Isil territory as we know, stoning takes place as it does in Saudi Arabia for “crimes” such as “Harlotry”. How many “Harlots” do we have in many of our towns and cities of whom violent Islamicists would exercise little sympathy and where the promiscuous male becomes the persecutor of immoral behaviour when that immoral behaviour is homosexuality or promiscuity by women. Collective moral action it could be called shorn of any respect for the individual based on contract, choice and consent.\nAnd yet it is the British left who are cradled in the loving arms of the very men who would have a violent reaction to most of the policies the British left has introduced and continues to support and promote.\nWe at Blue Revolution also support acceptance and the freedom to be homosexual or promiscuous but we on the other hand don’t accept the behaviour of violent Islamicist and so would not hob nob with them as the British left do. This situation of mutual support between the violent religious and political group think and the left is one of those paradoxes which only makes sense if you look at the whole thing at once; a bit like an Escher drawing. The Left’s support for Islamic traditionalism makes sense if you look at it as racial, as underprivilege to be addressed by taxation of the rich, or wealth redistribution, or social projects to support diversity or Palestine or alleged American Imperialism. But look further beyond those safe set piece areas of common ground, and it all starts to look a little less safe for the individual. There is much bad about the West its Capitalism and its “secular westernism”; but left-wing collective action combined with other collectivist groups of a more intolerant hue probably isn’t the answer.\nWe need to de construct the relationship between the British left and violent Islamicism to understand the risks, and when we do, we will see that the British left is intolerant and in its own way aggressive to the rights of the individual. Gays and women are at serious risk of harm from the views of the violent Islamicists becoming lodged into the wholly naïve views of British left. Their muddled idealism will act as the vector for forces hostile to the rights of the individual. The lingering remnants of “dust bowl” morality in the world will be nourished by these naïve people who fail to see that their grand political causes are simply a means for the intolerant to undermine the rights and freedoms of others.\nMarxism began life as a liberal ideology; and Marx himself in many ways never removed himself too far from the rights of the individual, seeing the role of Capitalism to confer bourgeois rights on the individual to trade and contract freely, admittedly in purely economic terms, but at the core of the model was freedom…….including as he rightly condemned the freedom to fail and to starve. The latter becoming the emotional driver for state intervention which in turn became collectivist as opposed to liberal Marxism, with its violent revolution and its perverse willingness to see people starve.\nRevolutionary Marxism caused limits to be placed on the rights of the individual as the revolutionary model requires individual rights to be set aside in favour of the rights of the collective. One extreme of this is National Socialism, or perhaps the role of Socialism in giving collective heft to theocratic revolutions such as Iran in the 1970’s, or Arab Nationalism where getting a mob to support an idea was the required way of gaining and keeping power.\nAt the other rather more harmless end of collectivism where for example equal pay was undermined in the 1940’s to the 1970’s collectively by Trades Unions in favour of male employment, and then when equal pay came in companies went bankrupt as they had to level their wages up.\nThe failure of Capitalism it could be argued has been in not bedding into other cultures the concept of personal freedom and in the case of advanced capitalism, not expressing personal freedom fully and democratically. Capitalism in attempting to protect its system from the mob limits power to Parliamentary process. In addition, too many communities remain dominated by control of the individual be that control exercised through religious or patriarchal means.\nBecause the Left abandoned Marxist “freedom”, in favour of harnessing the collective “will of the people” shaped and managed by experts or leaders, it meshes very well with other collectivist bodies and groups many of which are unreformed rule based and religious or political in character. For these groups respect for the individual does not extend to protecting individuals from deliberate physical or psychological harm.\nIt is this fit which makes the Left and Mr Corbyn a man to watch. Blairism for all its many failings was pro individual rights, Blair’s success in promoting extended rights to minorities was in part a product of the slow relentless decline of the “industrial powerhouses” of Trades Unionism where since the war Misogyny and homophobia was casual and common place as anyone over 40 will surely remember. A characteristic of the masculine culture of the time.\nCorbyn is essentially a useful fool for the likes of Hezbollah, and Hamas the IRA or even perhaps Isis……he clearly does not understand that freedom is based not on Government empowerment of the interests of the aggressive political or theological collectives. Remember the adage that one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. Freedom from tyranny comes with empowerment of the individual through amongst other things the Blue Revolution trio of Contract, Choice and Consent, practiced within a regulated free market framework and available universally to all adults.\nIf we support our politicians siding with those whose obligations are to the collective and the collective, whoever that is, believes some horrible stuff, our politicians won’t be able to put the genie of individual rights back in the bottle if that genie escapes…….they can only hope as they are rubbing the lamp that the genie stays put.\n26.08.15 British girls-unhappiest in EU. But why?\nMuch of what we have covered so far is relevant to the question; why British girls are so unhappy. Commentators speculate about pressures of school-work, broken families and relationships, but these applies to boys also. As an insightful group of people we thought we would add our Blue Revolution perspective on what in public health terms is probably as much a problem, if not a more serious problem, than the British diabetes epidemic. We will explain why.\nWe recently wrote about the jihadi brides, and more recently still about the inherent misogyny of “collectivist” cultures into which we folded groups who ignore individual rights (by for example blowing people up) such as Isis, Hamas, the IRA as well as to a less extreme degree the hard left of the Labour movement. At the most extreme the Jihadi brides expose the terrible conflicts faced by girls. To be desirable to a man but not to be overtly desirable conflicts with cultural expectations. To be cleaver but not so that it confers independence and may result in the traditional social role ascribed to girls being undermined. To be subordinate to one’s culture in a world which offers the most grotesque forms of self-promotion and self-expression. Being conflicted is hard to deal with…..ask any abused person who loves their abuser! So, in the case of Jihadi Brides the easiest way of escaping this psychological torture chamber is to opt for one side of the conflict or the other. Violent Islam wins out against Secular Westernism. The fact these Brides are too western to cut it with Isis we presume only dawns on them once they are trapped in a pitiless well of psychopathy and random aggression.\nIf Jihadi brides are the extreme how can this conflicted situation apply to Secular Western girls with one presumes no such personal, familial and religious challenges. Well just because there is no obvious religious pressure it does not follow that there is not an oppressive secular western culture causing conflicts of psychological intensity for girls. We have our seven modern deadly sins to complete, but so far we have looked at cruelty, objectification, breach of trust, want based consumption, and arguably just these four set a confusing context for young people.\nBeing measured by looks with the unwanted attention that this brings, whilst being insecure due to the absence of trust within many modern relationships will be stressful. Having the expectations that looks will bring financial success and therefore “want based consumption” whilst also having to grapple with the reality that childbirth will takes much of it away. Even in the 21st century childbirth remains the foundation of the proto fascism in the form of men’s dominion over woman.\nThe politically naïve and ideologically muddled Jeremy Corbyn supports women only carriages on trains an obvious throwback to women’s primary role and mankind’s primary expectation of women; childbirth and seclusion, whether they like it or not. In western culture girls who see themselves as having no economic role, do what nature requires of them, but not as society intended. For many there is no loving coupling but life as a stressed single mum whose choice was never “free” but heavily influenced by “welfare”; promoting the lifestyle of babies with no greater economic role but to consume benefits.\nWith the west offering, but not always delivering or fully respecting, the hard fought for “economic role” for girls, is it any wonder girls are unhappy. Boys don’t have this complexity to navigate. Girls do have this psychologically conflicted set of choices and in all honesty only the very brightest and economically most literate can navigate a coherent way through it. Perhaps we should focus on the economic role of girls, rather than the biological role that has led to thousands of years of oppression. We should stop promoting and subsidising childbirth as an option for girls, aside perhaps from only those who can cope with it sharing the role with a partner as necessary, in order to do it properly.\nPromoting the idea that girls have an important economic role without babies, do not have to have babies to be valued by society, and should avoid being seduced by the state into having babies for purely individual economic reasons, will surely help girls feel less conflicted and therefore a little bit happier.\n03.09.15 Faith and revolution- Red or Blue\nFaith and religion has had a mixed reception politically; somehow linked, but closely, obliquely or distantly depending on its political use. Roman Catholic attempts to regime change in South American nations three or more decades ago; as well as the revolution in Iran in the late 1970’s and in Burma much more recently. There has been Marx’s view that it was the “opium of the people” whilst Russia and China suppressed it in the same way that the dust bowl elements of Islam do the same to all faith but their own. In Britain the success of Christianity has been its failing as its ability to drive enterprise and risk taking has delivered past economic success whilst paying for relentless moral decline. The state in the form of Her Majesty’s Government stepping in to prevent some form of 21st century Peasants Revolt but making the problem worse. In pre Tudor times poverty was revered and the poor and those who gave alms were chosen for heaven, through to the 16th Century when the idea began to emerge that being poor was a crime to be punished and therefore to be avoided and not subsidised by state or the wealthy.\nIn the west and in America what faith there is, is too often associated with narcissism, hubris and greed. Theology offering wealth to the devout and God-fearing TV subscribers! In the Middle East we have a combination of dust bowl economies, some super rich and immoral by modern standards, and some poor and immoral as well as criminal. In the west and in Britain we have an established church which has defaulted to secularism in the last 30 years to such an extent the theology might best be described as the theology of being nice, with a nice undemanding liturgy to go along with it. However today alongside nice faith we have angry people looking for an angry faith or an angry politics. I need not dwell too much on this but to invite people to think about where these angry impulses are finding expression.\nThe faith that seems to offer some hope to some people is Islam, rule based and helpfully for some dogmatic. The politics which has gained recent traction is a kind of nationalism which has no traditional left right dimensions but is all about expecting “Government” to protect us; in Britain, it’s never clear protecting us from what. The Bankers, migrants, immigrants, the rich, the poor, who knows, but for some reason best known to Britain’s army of middle aged, armchair Prime Ministers, both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage capture the spirit of what they are supporting politically. And that seems to us to be a kind of collectivism that for these people binds the nation together, nationalism as a substitute for class, although we don’t think many would recognise that as informing their opinions. In this post class world, the nation unites and binds in the way that class used to. hence the success of Ukip and SNP and strangely perhaps the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. Should we be concerned? Are we at Blue Revolution concerned? Well yes and no.\nIn Britain the problem for the Church of England is that without the church being linked to a political collectivism, like class, it loses the ties that bind people to the faith, thus in the west the Christian faith is in terminal decline. In Britain the C of E is still operating, though on the back of wealth accumulated over the last 600 years or so. In America faith survives with televangelism and snake oil, but like in the UK, not in places where faith is really needed.\nWith Islam the theology is more political, both local and global. Immoral immodest behaviour at home, western aggression or indifference abroad. The political issues grant a collective legitimacy to Islam that is echoed and respected in the political collectivism of the left. Though as we have said in previous posts this attraction isn’t really understood by either side. A bit like two people drawn to each other but neither really understand why. Thus, there is a political and faith convergence which would be a cause for celebration amongst people of faith like us, if the thing that linked them wasn’t an out of date and possibly hazardous collectivism. Collectivism we believe leads to the rights of the individual being ignored as the individual is pushed aside by the clamour to achieve “collective outcomes by collective action”. The growing albeit ill defined demand for collectivism and government intervention amongst our armchair PM’s both erstwhile and new labour party “supporters” will lead the Labour Party in the UK to fracturing somewhere down a fault line to the left of its centre. The centre right parliamentary party we believe, will be pushed to breaking point by the accession of Jeremy Corbyn. The centre right MP’s will either be shoved out, to find a home in other parties or will just go willingly elsewhere. The Political left and the collectivist hangers on will make the Labour Party, not a serious party of government, but a left wing campaigning collective with a hotch potch of ideas that will in time increasingly ignore the rights of individuals and groups that don’t fit in to their world picture. It certainly won’t be All Faiths and None but more my “faith” not yours. This is the problem with the British hard left, they won’t know when they have fired the starting pistol for an attempt at a Red Revolution.\nWe at Blue Revolution advocate a Blue Revolution. It should be clear what this is from what we have written so far. It is a revolution in the hearts and minds of individuals who recognise that peace comes from using the freedoms accorded by Contract, Choice and Consent in a moral faith based way (Blue Revolution) that supports democracy, supports and respects all people of all faiths and none and rejects behaviour which is cruel, immodest, needlessly consuming, untrustworthy etc but all delivered at a personal level by individual moral agents….because in a world dominated by immoral or sinful behaviours only the collective action of the state can bring control to the chaos……..it’s a pity no mainstream faith can combine their theology with the theology of freedom as reflected in the Blue revolution.\n07.09.15 Sexual offending, exclusions, unhappiness- What is going on with British students\nThis is going to be a short but topical post to try and offer the Blue Revolution perspective on British youth who have hit the headlines this week for some of the worst reasons. It has to be accepted that there are some inspiring young people, those who are brave in the face of adversity and challenge and those with potential to achieve great things on behalf of themselves and their family and their community. However in this post industrial world of Secular Westernism too many young people lack belief ; belief in a creed, belief in a God or even a belief in themselves. The Blue Revolution view is that this leaves them vulnerable to the superficial temptations of Secular Western culture with its self medicating stimulants of Sex and drugs and needless consumption. When these are not easily attainable by a growing number of low aspiring young people the lack of belief in themselves to achieve something for themselves encourages rule breaking. Thus we have too much sexual offending and too much unruly behaviour and low performance and further reduced expectations.\nWe are not called Blue Revolution because we believe some people don’t have faith in themselves, but because we accept that not all people have a religious faith; however we accept Darwinism as a substitute for faith and we can identify the concept of group survival as integral to the role all faith has had in mankind’s evolution since we first became self conscious thousands of years ago. Hence the need to accept all faiths….. and none. More young people need to be inspired to have faith, even if it is limited to faith in themselves and the contribution they can make to the long term development of humanity as reflected in their group or community. Every human being regardless of age or ability is gaining, through technology, the opportunity to contribute to their group and community; but for some the lack of personal belief set in a world of superficial social and economic charms, proves to be too tempting for them, and thus harmful to others.\nThe revolution starts in the heart of the individual and not the head of the group.",

So far so good. The spiteful ‘Old’ Labour idea of squeezing the private sector wealthy as though they were some kind of hideous raptor screwing the country over, whilst allowing the well-heeled public sector elite to up their wages to compensate for higher taxes is outrageous.

Elderly people being overlooked by offspring who have been conditioned to think of themselves as economic consumer units rather than social creatures with human obligations towards the young and elderly. Enabling some twisting within the economy to allow the economically active to step out of role seems fair but it will come at a cost. We calculate the cost will be considered justified on the basis that it is cheaper than adult social care. However, people being out of the workplace are a cost to companies and the state, particularly when you have to consider covering their absence with temporary staff and then taking them back later. There is also the problem of the stressed public sector which can’t recruit at the best of times and the sheer grind of coal face work in the public sector making the option of opting out very attractive. Unfortunately, Mrs May’s new labour policies are just more of the state putting a sticking plaster and another expensive one at that on the gaping wound of failed economic and social policies. It very much reflects but in a different way the problem of how to manage the millions of people who now form the second and third generation unemployed ex-industrial and agricultural workers who have been patronised and outrageously labelled the underclass by remote politicians who patch them up with welfare and healthcare, rather than work.\nHowever, there may be a proper solution to these twin problems. How about turning the welfare benefits system into a public wage system and require everyone in the benefits system to work pro rata at the living wage for their welfare. The welfare system was set up when a man (we are talking about 7o years ago) could lose an industrial job and get another one relatively quickly. Now mortgages and debt trap people and the jobs are not going to come back anytime soon. So rather than politicians holding out the forlorn hope of the unemployed moving to another industrial job, why not empower and pay the unemployed to look after their own. Turning the second and third generation unemployed ex-industrial and agricultural workers into the first generation community social workers. We would say that was welfare well spent.",

The players were like bankers and lawyers mere flunkies of the capitalist. At that time the political system was set up to efficiently manage the capitalist economy and ensure the competing needs of the big players, the landowners and men of capital, could have their differences reconciled without taking up arms. The whole process worked so well that by the 1750’s the British Empire spanned the globe bringing trade that would eventually liberate people from poverty and disease.\nThe 17th and 18th centuries were the period when a free people and a free capitalist class drove up economic value in such vast amounts that London was so wealthy it became a city of expensive architectural marvels. The Law Courts in London, the Naval HQ at Greenwich from where the Empire was policed and the end of slavery enforced, and of course Parliament itself. The Capitalist political model was adopted elsewhere in the world, notably the UAS signifying the success of the Bourgeois revolution…..or as it is known in Britain the “Glorious Revolution”.\nPoliticians were there to promote and protect this capitalist model and secure its future. The Monarch has by this time acquired a purely symbolic function and has discharged this role competently right up to the present day. And long may that part of the State continue. It is the least problematic part of the British State by a country mile.\nThe problem is that the capitalist model is now defunct! Lets stop there and think about that. How is the capitalist system defunct? Well to be capitalist, capitalism has to produce economic value by combining things like land and labour thus creating Goods and resources that can be traded for money. This money builds up as wealth. This wealth enables the rich to pay taxes and the state to function in the interests of the economic players the Capitalist and Landowners, and by the 20th century the workers too. If we accept this definition of capitalism, capitalism has had its heyday and has been replaced by the debt dependent “free market”.\nThe free market was an important element of the Capitalist system. Based on Contract, Choice and Consent it allowed “trade” to flourish. However without the economic underbelly of “capitalism” it has spawned a virulent form of immoral consumerism driven by debt. This consumerism is unsustainable, planet destroying and will eventually, like capitalism itself fail spectacularly. When this happens, and unless we prepare for a properly democratic “managed decline” involving ordinary people making decisions about their future, we are likely to lose the elements of Contract, Choice and Consent that were the kingpin of the last three hundred years of trade, freedom and democracy and find ourselves governed by an indifferent elite. Worse than now trust us!\nSo how do our modern western politicians fit into this doomsday scenario? Well as we said at the beginning they were originally there to promote the interests of the bourgeois economy and that bourgeois economy paid for the state and therefore paid them and those who administered the State.\nNow of course the State pays for them with no bourgeois economy paying for the state. The State pays for almost everything else too. To meet its obligations the State relies on debt.\nWith the State indebting us up to our ears and ordinary taxpayers indebted up to their ears too, paying taxes on a salary that relatively speaking would have been too low to tax by 18th century standards, we are all paying hand over fist to keep a political, public sector and “free market elite” in well remunerated work but for no discernible reason. Frankly the old the young the taxpayer the planet and the indebted can no longer afford to support this outdated system.\nBlue Revolution says “move over State elite and let the people take over, it’s our country and it’s our planet”.",

The anxious foot-soldiers of the illiberal elite clearly believe that Trump represents a shamelessly divisive and discriminatory perspective and will roll back decades of progress in respect of social integration and sexual equality. This is of course, as far as we are concerned, rubbish. The reason is that the U.S. is a democracy with a constitution that makes it impossible for Trump to deliver an agenda based on hatred or discrimination. He may send some reproductive rights back to the individual States but that is pretty much as far as he could go.\nWhat the foot soldiers of the illiberal elite are protesting about is that Clinton didn’t have an argument at the U.S. election and therefore lost. She and the elite demonstrated an absence of a so-called “liberal ideology” that takes America beyond the Clinton, Bush, Obama status quo. A status quo which has sucked up to amongst others the Saudi’s with their heroic record of women’s rights whilst turning on others no better but certainly no worse.\nThe foot soldiers of the elite don’t know who to blame for the mess America (and the EU)) is in. The wealth inequality, the celebrity culture, the banking crisis, social and moral decay etc. The foot soldiers can’t possibly blame themselves or the liberal elite who have helped them gain their individual personal identity and employed them in the government sector. All this whilst giving the blue collar workers the order of the boot as their jobs were exported abroad.\nSo they will blame Trump for…. well-being Trump, a seventy-year-old locker room jock with wandering hands, bad hair, cringeworthy chat up lines, and a self-important turn of phrase. In the overall scheme of things Trump probably comes in well ahead of Obama and Bush in the sexual preoccupation stakes……but well behind “old man” Clinton, the adulterers’ adulterer.\nAs we posted yesterday Trump will, of course, be his own undoing. Which is sad. But it is unlikely to be a sexual impropriety that does for him.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_537/content_304.html": "Trust us, the western world could ball itself up and toss itself into the dustbin of history. Why? because we have no positive “narrative”.\nLook around the world and you see nations engaging in a kind of verbal warfare. Better of course than actual warfare but pointless and limiting. The problem is or so it seems to us, too many countries fail to understand their shared value base. They, for one reason or another, prefer to obsess about difference rather than what is similar or familiar. The reason is probably because they came to where they are via different routes.\nJust as you can “hack” across the English countryside to get to Sheffield, you can also take the motorway. Both journeys end up at the same place but the experience of getting there will be very different. So like Russia and the West we have arrived at a 21st century socioeconomic system that is broadly the same; Debt based and consumer driven. This is currently where all western type nations stand. Nations who have, by dint of capitalist exploitation or exploitation by the industrialised state, got to a point where working people have acquired a level of freedom which is different from cultures which are for other reasons locked into a mediaeval “dark ages”. North Korea, Saudi Arabia and most of the Middle East, are feudal systems propped up by wealth controlled by a state elite who ruthlessly control power. No good being an outspoken soldier in North Korea or an outspoken woman is Saudi. This would be too much for the “state”. Death would await.\nThe perversity of why the West is as it is, is to us quite simple. Before you can equalise people (moving away from gender or race based discrimination for example) you have to prolatarianise them. It is the process of prolatarianisation, be it private capitalist or state capitalist systems like Russia, which drives the demand for equality. Industrialisation simply needs workers, not male workers or female workers, black workers or white workers but workers! Eventually Gay workers etc. Countries that have not industrialised and have not therefore prolatarianised cannot deliver freedom and equality. It simply isn’t in the cultural vocabulary for them to do so. So invariably you end up with a North Korea or Saudi Arabia, Myanmar or wherever. It is just the way it is. Look at a woman in a Burka and you don’t see a person defined by her work you see a woman defined by her gender. Scary stuff if you are a woman on the left wing of politics!\nNow this reflects a problem for the West in that we no longer have a “capitalist” system, reinforcing capitalist principles of contract, choice and consent.\nCapitalism, before it morphed into the ghastly debt based “free market”, had spawned one very significant but ignorant and ungrateful offspring, namely socialism. Socialists don’t seem to see that the wealth spent by socialist governments came from capitalism, wealth they spent on welfare systems and social reform.\nSocialists somehow think that this bounteous wealth came from the actions of socialist governments alone and not from the actions of industry and workers. It’s ignorance makes it careless about the freedoms that have flowed from capitalism. The freedom for women to work, to be part of the political system, to freely marry divorce and have lives determined by them and not the state or their gender, is thanks, not to socialism alone, but to the principles laid down in early capitalist society. Without those principle socialism would have had neither the vocabulary nor the money to effect real change in peoples lives via health, welfare and personal rights.\nHowever modern socialism with its state managed obsessions about diversity and its embrace of all things anti capitalist, is now in danger of promoting systems of rights which are pre capitalist and pre socialist. Rights defined by gender predominantly. Today socialism provides a fertile home, particularly in the United Kingdom,for islamists, misogynists, anti Semites and homophobes to flourish. The sad thing is most modern socialists including our old friend Jeremy Corbyn are too ill informed about socialisms roots to realise it, or to understand how they contribute to it…..as too are most of their voters.\nOnly a Blue Revolution can take ordinary workers on a progressive journey into the future, preserving our hard fought for workers rights and freedoms. Sadly the modern left will simply bankrupt us, ball us up and drop our culture into the dustbin of history, followed shortly by socialism itself!",

Finally, blue is the colour of the last hat in our proposed decision-making process.\nRevolution: Our aim as a political platform is to bring an end to the Party Political system.\nThe Platform for Ending Party Politics\nHaving a party political system means we have elected politicians who are conflicted between what is right for their party and that which is right for their constituents.\nIt is the constituents who vote for their representative by name, not by party. To us at a Blue Revolution, it is the voters who deserve full representative without the party confusing the situation.\nThere are examples of fully independent councils and they have great outcomes because the members vote on conscious and what they believe is best for their area with no confusion from the Political Party System.\nSuccessive Prime Ministers and Opposition Leaders have discussed bringing an end to the confrontational style of politics, ‘Punch and Judy’ as David Cameron called it, at Prime Ministers Question Time.\nEach of the Six Thinking Hats represents a different style of thinking. Here’s a quick outline.\n1. White Hat\nThis is for putting up facts and figures neutrally and objectively. Look at the available information and also identify information gaps, so we can choose to fill them or just take account of them. This is where you provide background information, and analyse and extrapolate historical trends.\n2. Red Hat\nThe red hat represents the emotional view. It recognizes and gives visibility to feelings, intuition and gut reaction as an important part of thinking. The red hat allows a thinker to switch in and out of his feeling mode, and also to invite others to share their feelings, in a non-judgemental way. By making emotions visible, we can observe their influence in the thinking process.\n3. Black Hat\nThe black hat represents caution and what could go wrong. It points out what doesn’t fit, what may not work, what is wrong, and hence protects us from fatal flaws and wasted resources. The black hat recognizes the value of caution and risk assessment; it makes our plans more robust.\n4. Yellow Hat\nThe yellow hat focuses on value, benefits and optimism. It is positive and constructive. It helps us to develop “value sensitivity” and invest time to seek out value.\n5. Green Hat\nThe green hat is about creativity, new ideas and change. This is when we present alternative and new ideas, possibilities, and modify or improve suggested ideas. It is about recognizing the value of creative effort and allocating time for it.\n6. Blue Hat\nThe blue hat is for process control, and for managing and organizing thinking. It has a strategic role in laying out the overall plan, and also for moment-to-moment instructions. It helps to organize the other hats, assess priorities, list constraints etc. Unlike the other hats, the blue hat is a permanent role. It is worn by the facilitator or chairperson of the meeting, though the leader may also assign the blue-hat role to others, or invite participants to wear the blue hat.\nSource: – https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-six-thinking-hats/\nWith the ‘Six Thinking Hats’ style of working, we would no longer need party politics because everybody will be doing what is best for the country and their constituents and not conflicted by the party.\nShould a constituent not agree the elected representative’s direction after the ‘Six Thinking Hats’ process, the thinking behind the decision can be shared with the individual to understand the decision and put forward an alternative idea if needed.\nThis will enable a new level of transparency that is not clouded by underlying party political allegiances and donor influences.\nIf like us you would like to see a new cleaner, more honest decision-making process within our democratic system please join our political platform and help this new future become a reality.\n5 Aims | About | Introduction | History | Economy | The People | Who | 3C’s | Education | Blue Planet | Glossary",

Its why the Labour Party lost the 2019 election.\n25th December 2019\nDear Friend\nI am from a small political group based in Boston Lincolnshire. Although we all hold slightly different political views, we are all united in the belief that the political system is undemocratic and is holding Britain back. I personally write about these issues from a Classical Marxist perspective usually for a centre-right audience. In view of the recent Tory Party General Election success, I thought you might like to consider our broad view on their success and Labour’s failure to connect with the electorate – particularly their traditional electoral strongholds in the Midlands and North.\nTo understand the Tory Party success in the 2019 General Election it is necessary to grasp the concept of voter consciousness and to view this through the prism of classical Marxism. At Blue Revolution, we offer a twenty-first-century Marxist analysis which we hope will inform debates across the whole political spectrum and which we hope will contribute to the development of radical and progressive policies. The aim of these policies would be the continued empowerment of ordinary working people; the modern working class.\nUntil the late twentieth century, working-class militancy was driven by fury at the perception of burning economic and social injustices. These injustices were linked by the British left-wing, to the illegitimate use of economic elitism, unfairness and class-based status. The Tory Party became to many on the left and remains for some, the enduring political symbol of these injustices. However, there is a growing awareness among working people that the situation is more complicated than this simple political trope suggests. Working people have enjoyed growing political sophistication explained in Marxist terms as raised consciousness. People can see through political simplicities.\nThe consciousness of the working class is, according to Marx, formed by a complex set of significant economic and social factors. There was the industrial reality of the nineteenth century that demanded worker co-operation in the production of goods and services, yet simultaneously alienated them from the working environment. Alienation is a feeling of being disconnected from the process of production – being in effect simply a cog in a wheel.\nAnother significant factor in the development of worker consciousness was ‘exploitation’. Whilst workers created wealth, they saw no benefit from having done so. Only the bourgeoisie aka capitalists got rich on the wealth created by workers’ labour-power. In Marx’s day ordinary workers worked long unregulated hours, they were ill-educated, unhealthy and poor with no political rights.\nCapitalism in its creation had struggled out from under the ‘yoke’ of feudalism by developing revolutionary legal principles; most relevantly, contract, choice and consent. In the 1840s these principles, of course, were only enjoyed by the capitalists, but in theory, as opposed to eighteenth and nineteenth-century practice they could legally apply to the working class too. The fact they didn’t was due to the capitalists preventing working people from enjoying these principles to maintain their ‘class advantage’.\nWhilst the capitalist system was good for capitalists and the political elite who maintained this ‘bourgeois’ political system and economy for them, it was bad for workers. In Marxist terms, it had within it the ‘the seeds of its own destruction’. These seeds were growing resentment at the poor treatment of workers, coupled to rising worker consciousness of the capitalist systems legal principles of contract, choice and consent. Over time workers become aware of how these legal principles were being used illegitimately to promote elitism and unfairness. The upshot according to Marx would be a revolution.\nTo overcome their enforced alienation, exploitation and denial of the rights to ‘freely’ contract, choose and consent, workers had to overcome false consciousness. Religion, the concept of a capitalist ‘fair wage’ and exclusion from political power, all helped to reinforced worker false consciousness or acceptance of the status quo. Having acquired collective raised consciousness i.e. being able to see disadvantage and being unwilling to accept it, a revolution would ensue.\nAfter the revolution, the workers would acquire for themselves the rights associated with the bourgeoisie. Had an actual Marxist revolution ever taken place the working class would not only have assumed control of the means of production – thus ending alienation and exploitation – but they would take control of the state too, thus providing for themselves an education, welfare and healthcare. The Russian revolution failed to deliver ‘justice’ because the people were denied power by Lenin and then Stalin’s autocratic state.\nAs a result of progressive social policies in Britain, the circumstances for modern working people do not resemble those of the nineteenth-century proletariat. Working people have acquired many of the economic freedoms and social benefits denied to us in Marx’s mid-nineteenth century. We have thus had our collective demands fulfilled by evolution rather than revolution. This has removed the anger which fuelled the urge for revolution amongst our forebears. Our collective consciousness no longer demands, but now expects worker’s rights to be upheld, universal education, healthcare and a fair welfare system. The working class has moved on. Sadly, our political system hasn’t moved on with us.\nWhere the bourgeois system continues to alienate the working class is now not so much in economic as political terms. Parliament itself stands as a proud symbol of bourgeois status, class and elitism, denying the working class the political power a properly Marxist revolution would have delivered.\nWorking-class consciousness is now shaped by contract, choice and consent, the enlightenment principles underpinning the free market. People might not routinely articulate these principles, but as Marx would have said that’s because as principles they have taken on ‘social character’. People don’t need to articulate them, but they feel it when these principles are breached against their class interests. These principles more than the burning social and economic injustices of the nineteenth century define the collective consciousness of the twenty-first century working class.\nThat said ordinary people have a growing awareness that these principles remain gifts to be granted to working people by those in power. They do not belong to us by right. The Brexit debacle proved that. Our bourgeois parliament controls our nation and is not under any obligation to us. A referendum is only ever advisory. It advises our bourgeois parliament, which is quite within its rights to ignore our views.\nBourgeois political systems across the western world continue to maintain political power structures based on eighteenth-century elitism in the face of working-class demands for greater contract and consent. There is a growing recognition that elitist political structures don’t justify the existence of political elites. The reality for working people ‘buffering’ against the old elitist structures has created a fractious political climate that the personality of Boris Johnson and his apparent stance on Brexit has been able to temporarily overcome. Hence his landslide victory.\nThere are many policy areas where people have been denied a voice by the Westminster political class; the policy of greater EU integration or the war in Iraq are two. However, we will look at Brexit and the continuing influence of ‘religion’ in politics. The aim is to illustrate the point that a new twenty-first-century radicalism is needed which is relevant to working people’s expectations and brings an end to political structures that neither reflect modern working-class consciousness nor promote progressive values but reinforce political elitism.\nIn 2016 the British had Project Fear unleashed on them by a Brussels-obsessed political elite. The elite promoted unfairness by failing to listen to ordinary people and by promoting themselves as an entitled and informed political class. The narrowness of the leave victory was a success for Project Fear. The triumph of a white, middle-class and remote parliamentary elite offended the class consciousness of Britain’s working people. The British working class with no ‘skin’ in the EU game recognised that the EU project was bureaucratic, unfathomable and unnecessary for the business of trade and friendship. The upshot of parliament supporting the EU was a miserable failure of the bourgeois left to make headway on this issue in the 2019 General Election. The left had stopped listening to working people and had consolidated around their London elite. The EU issue was also a failure of the political system to reflect working people’s expectations and highlighted how little real power we have. The success of Boris Johnson will be used to justify the current political system, which for growing numbers of working people is simply not good enough.\nOur next issue being more about modern values than policy reflects the absence of a confident political maturity on the part of the political class compared to the maturity of Britain’s working people.\nMost people in Britain have no time for religion and fewer than half believe in God. This is an important and progressive part of working-class collective consciousness. Of those who do believe in God, their God if Judaeo Christian or Islamic comes packaged as an ideology that Karl Marx said reflected various stages in the development of humanity’s evolving consciousness.\nWe have a working class that is perhaps mildly interested in cultural symbolism but is basically disinterested in God or religion. A bit culturally Christian but possessing an enlightened consciousness based on choice and consent underpinned not by God but by science. This large class has been forced to witness uncritical support for the faith of Islam, a faith that reveals doctrinally no grasp of the importance of choice and consent but which is regularly promoted and protected from criticism by a culturally-illiterate and largely (but not exclusively) left-wing elite.\nBy failing to understand the basic fact that the history of God is a history of class exploitation and gender discrimination of one sort or another, the left is failing to connect with working-class values of the twenty-first century.\nIf the left continues to promote religious ideologies of all types which are seen by working people to promote sectarianism, as well as divinely sanctioned discrimination, particularly against gay people and women, it will never be considered progressive. Moreover, it goes against the grain of classical Marxism, being a failure on the part of the left to liberate people from the remnants of global exploitation and oppression, which continues to be justified on the basis that it’s divinely ordained. Think Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nIn the twenty-first century the challenge for western politics is to reform our elite political systems so working people have more influence over the state and those who operate it on our behalf. Currently, the only option open to working people is to seek out political heroes and give them landslide majorities. The Labour Party hoped Corbyn would do this in 2017 and 2019. The process of a personality like Thatcher, Blair, Corbyn, Johnson or Trump tapping into working-class consciousness isn’t new. When it happens, it is a symptom that the political system is unwilling or incapable of giving real power to working people. Under such a system working people only have hero-worship to fall back on and that has, in the past, gone badly wrong! Sadly, as was seen during the 2019 General Election campaign having ‘outspoken’ working-class candidates supposedly representing working-class people isn’t the same as giving working-class people real political power.\nSo, what are the radicals who are prepared to break the system from the left or indeed right going to do? Well, we have some ideas which are intended to empower local authority council members to scrutinise parliamentary policy and in time acquire the right to become part of the legislature. This would run alongside scrapping the House of Lords. We hope you will do your bit to shift the debate about democracy away from making the current system look like its working and argue for changing the current system – because frankly, it doesn’t work and never really has worked for the many, just the few.\nYours sincerely\nMike Gilbert part of a Blue Revolution",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_open-letter-to-black-lives-matter-a-british-marxist-perspective-from-blue-revolution/content_265.html": "Open Letter to Black Lives Matter\nOpen Letter to Black Lives Matter – A British Perspective from Blue Revolution.\nDear Black Lives Matter,\nHaving read about your organisation from your website it seems that your aim is not just to bring about greater harmony between people of different races by highlighting the disproportionate impact of structural inequality on the black community. Your aim seems to be to destroy what is described as ‘capitalism’, imperialism, patriarchy, and white supremacy. These terms can be understood in a variety of ways, but I choose to understand them from a classical Marxist perspective. As you appear to be offering a revolutionary social programme not too dissimilar to some programmes which were associated with nineteenth-century Marxism, it is important to remind ourselves that those programmes failed to preserve liberty and opportunity for all working people. With all twentieth-century type Marxist programmes, there is a risk that the programme will simply cause chaos and eventually bring about the end of freedom and liberty and return society to authoritarianism in the name of maintaining social order and the pursuit of the ‘idea’ of socialism.\nTo tackle inequality, unfairness and elitism, such as the domination of modern institutions by the upper middle classes people would be better off joining together rather than becoming alienated from one another and letting the elite off the hook by allowing them to think that structural inequality is caused by the white ‘far-right’ working-class discriminating against the black working class. Workers and ordinary people of all colours should unite around the world.\nCapitalism, as critiqued by Karl Marx was an inevitable phase of history and involved workers, under the veil of ‘bourgeois’ freedom being forced on pain of starvation to sell their labour-power, under contract to capitalists and thereby ‘freely’ accepting their own exploitation. Freedom itself was not the problem, it was the way the bourgeoisie used worker ‘freedom’ to effectively trap them into a world of low pay, with no welfare, no education, no healthcare, and no pensions. These were the issues for Marx. Freedom was a social good, but the absence of social provision coupled with low pay created a toxic economic environment that could only be addressed by collective action.\nToday we have retained our freedom and for the last eighty years enlightened governments, under pressure from workers, particularly in Europe, no longer allow ‘naked’ exploitation. We do not in Europe, or the United Kingdom have a wholly ‘capitalist’ domestic economy as Marx would have understood it. Our domestic economy is broadly what Marx would have called socialist and whilst there are still ‘structural problems’ that need addressing, those structural problems affect white people as well as black people and should be addressed by us together.\nWhilst the global economy is ‘capitalist’ it is hard to imagine how any movement will achieve anything without mass multiracial global cooperation by the worlds working classes. This is unlikely to be forthcoming in anything like the near future. The results will be that direct violent action only serves to reverse what achievements have been made on behalf of all workers so far. These achievements in the United Kingdom are not inconsiderable. There is also the risk that the process of direct action may destroy the freedoms all workers have achieved too and thus empower totalitarian nations to exploit western workers of all backgrounds.\nImperialism is understood by most on the traditional as well as classically Marxist left as the expansion of one nation’s economy by invasion into another nation’s markets by military force, otherwise known as colonialism. Western nations have been actively engaged in abandoning their old colonies, so colonialism is no longer an issue for the worlds free nations.\nWe have global capitalism largely unregulated and therefore widespread global trade. This has been called neo-colonialism. The need to invade to shore up collapsing national economies or to gain global influence is no longer necessary, global bodies like the World Trade Organisation make such action unnecessary and the United Nations renders such action illegal. But the drive for free trade or neo-colonialism is more complex. Whilst Marxists would agree that global capitalism has a corrosive effect on the planet and the lives of millions of people, by spreading trade, and peace, as well as freedom, and cooperation, global values are being promoted. Without the principles of capitalist freedom underpinning free trade, nations burdened by tyranny, a lack of democracy or oppression would struggle to liberate their people. Neo-Colonialism is, therefore, a two-edged sword. Like capitalism itself.\nDestroying imperialism is therefore unnecessary as it no longer goes on via military conquest. Destroying global capitalism is unlikely to happen at the moment as power structures inside and outside the western world remain largely indifferent to change. Failing to recognise capitalisms positive contributions, ignores the reality that many countries that were victims of past imperialism are now successful global traders and freely participating in the world economy, improving the lives of their people and introducing democracy. So Global capitalism is not wholly good, but it is not wholly bad either, as Marx said it is a phase in humanities evolution. It must be allowed to leave behind a legacy of freedom and democracy. If it were possible to destroy global capitalism by direct action in one country, for example, the United States, it may not actually serve the interests of the worlds, ordinary workers at this stage of humanities social and economic evolution.\nIn respect of patriarchy, this is a post tribal reality for females, being the control of females and their sexual behaviour with men, to control male personal wealth and power, its ownership and inheritance. There is now little control of females in the west for this purpose. Patriarchy exists in the world, but the western world does not control female’s sexual behaviour for any reason including the ownership and the inheritance of wealth. Females are considered the equals of males and this is enshrined in legislation. How do Black lives Matter propose to dismantle patriarchy without sending females back to a pre-patriarchal world where the only characteristic of interest to men was not the wealth females represented, but their simple collective reproductive capacity? This ambition of abolishing patriarchy sounds laudable but the implications for women are truly outrageous. Look at virtually every country outside of the west? You will see patriarchy being proudly promoted. It is particularly prevalent in the Islamic world.\nFinally, white supremacy. In my paragraph on capitalism above, I referred to ‘structural inequality’. This is best summed up as the institutional disparity in wealth and power between different groups in society. The impact of structural inequality impacts on both the poor white community and the poor black community. It might be more visible in the case of the black community but the exploitation of the working class historically, and the structural inequalities prevalent today in Britain affect white people and black people equally. There is nothing a poor white person can legally do which a poor black person cannot do but both can and are excluded from achieving a fulfilling life by our political and economic systems continued unfairness, elitism, and inequality.\nAmerica does not need a socially and economically destructive revolution it simply needs to develop as an interim phase of its history the kind of socialism that exists in the United Kingdom and Europe. The revolution will need to wait.\nBlue Revolution",

Bourgeois socialist: is someone who knows that the western economic system creates social, political and economic inequalities but they do not want to change the system they will just be anxious about it.\n(2) Abraham Maslow stated that there was a hierarchy of human needs at the base people needed food water and shelter at the top relationships and ultimately to fulfil their own personal aspirations.\n(3) Karl Marx was a political philosopher who identified how working people had been either exploited openly by elites in pre capitalist times or were exploited under the cloak of ‘freedom’ based on contract, choice and consent under capitalism. He called his theory scientific socialism.\n(4) Consciousness is seeing the world framed in a way which benefits you and your class. Bourgeois consciousness is about protecting elitism, unfairness and maintaining class distinction and identity. Working class consciousness is recognising that bourgeois principles like contract, choice and consent should not be used as an excuse to exploit workers and that elitism, unfairness and bourgeois class identity undermine everyone’s right to live democratically, freely and fairly.\n(5) Alienation: The experience of being detached from any ownership of your work and alienated from other people by the monotony of the workplace.\n(6) Exploitation: The process by which capitalist make profit from the workers and then turn this profit into their own private property. It is an abuse of the principles of contract, choice and consent as the worker is never told that they will not receive their share of the profits they create. The economics of capitalist exploitation have become more complicated in the modern era and are of limited value today.\n(7) Patriarchal: A system that controls women in interests of property ownership, control and inheritance. It is based on the privilege of men over women. It began after tribal times and extended in an economic from in the west into the twentieth century. It is still prevalent elsewhere in the world.\n(8) This Marxist quote means that what we do collectively to provide for our family and society whether it is within a tribal, feudal or capitalist system shapes how we see the world and our way of thinking (our group consciousness)…rather than our group way of thinking shaping the way we provide for our families. It is putting action before thought. For example, it would not have occurred to anyone to think about ‘freedom’ before capitalism required people to be ‘free’.\n(9) See 1 above.\n(10) Social value is everything that contributes to society being well organised and efficient.\n(11) Conscience is a belief or feeling that something is wrong and harmful to others.",

This along with the demand for gender segregation in universities who have accepted some Islamic guest speakers, as well as the use of the veil and other kinds culturally specific practices and behaviours, seems to have caused confusion to commentators and some politicians alike. There seems to be among some well- intended and liberal minded people the view that acceptance of these requirements confers important inclusive status on them.\nPerversely there has also been a growing intolerance by some females who identify themselves as liberal feminists but who rail against men who have the audacity to speak to them in public. Whether these men are “chatting them up” or are simply trying to make polite conversation in that strained British way, is perhaps irrelevant; the point is why react so aggressively to what is on the face of it harmless attempt at human interaction. Perhaps segregation provides the answer.\nThe main issue in these scenarios is that it is gender based and thus open to a whole world of confusion and misunderstanding; particularly in respect of what is suggested and intended. This happens in the absence of a coherent position about why such segregation is demanded. Should that position statement offer support for segregation though? Should it be general segregation, segregation in lecture halls, segregation on trains and the veil as a means of emphasising segregation. Are these the right and proper responses to the issues thrown up practically and culturally by men and women sharing the same space in lecture halls, trains and the world in general. We at Blue Revolution think not and wonder why there is little compelling analysis of why not. The well-intentioned liberal sleepwalking towards a world of sexual discrimination on the back of demands for cultural inclusion. You couldn’t make it up.\nCulturally mankind has been through phases where such segregating behaviour was not only logical it was necessary to preserve the social and economic context that provided the value and wealth necessary to sustain the community, be that a family, tribe or nation. Men and women had separate spheres of influence and therefore separation seemed logical and created stability where otherwise instability may have cast a shadow over survival. Like much that is outdated but “cultural” such practices become totemic of particular cultures or as with the veil, fetishized politically as a means of emphasising one’s faith based moral superiority. This is done not always with a calm and deep conviction that adherence to such beliefs about modesty is about personal identity, but as a loud expression of cultural and group difference. Culture can get caught in a time warp and distorts faith so it provides a reactionary solution to very modern problems if indeed some of these things are problems. Things like being chatted up on a train; solution; women only carriages, sexual delinquency in the community; public separation of the sexes, abuse of women by men; the veil. Really?\nOf course rather than accept these ideas at face value it makes sense to explore them sensibly and to arrive at a coherent perspective; the danger of not doing so is that the rights argument kicks in and the whole issue is drowned out as it is in France by the application of competing rights to do and not do. A kind of fetishism develops on both sides of the argument. The real question is this; just how necessary is segregation, in a world that needs to progress cooperation between the sexes so that mankind’s creative social and economic power can be maximised and perhaps the production of people curtailed.\nDo we really need to adopt practices which were more in keeping for an age of uncertainty, contingency, war, disease and famine?\nNow apart from confusion about how to solve the wests gender related social problems, what often leads to the demand for gender separation amongst the liberal minded is that the advocates are largely from a range of nationalities who feel their largely Islamic faith is persecuted by the west, thus oddly legitimising any anti-western cultural position on anything. So, some on the left give advocates of separation a sympathetic hearing. Some thinkers and even feminists appear sold on the idea that the capitalist world commodifies or objectifies people on gender lines too, therefore a solution is to segregate the sexes for non- capitalist reasons and thus neutralise the power of that capitalist objectification. This for us at Blue Revolution is like accepting the removal of a leg to cure the pain of an ingrowing toenail. We have explored objectification ourselves in previous posts. It is one of our deadly sins, the solution is nor separation though.\nOf course, the west has issues, big ones too. The freedoms allowed in the individuals having rights to Consent, Contract and Choose means that we can promote lifestyles which of excessive and bad for us and for our communities. We at Blue Revolution call this negative side to western culture “Secular Westernism”. However, the solution cannot be separation or segregation. We need to address the West’s problems be they problem of debt based over consumption, illegitimacy, divorce, depression, drug or alcohol misuse; but we can’t do this at the expense of our freedoms and our ability to mix and mingle together as genders because this is how we deliver social and economic value.\nIf you look at the joyous outcomes of the West’s freedom; the technology, engineering, space exploration, medicine, arts and sports one would not want to turn the clock back to any kind of separation or segregation based on a social and economic model that is now largely defunct apart from in ISIS territory. The blue revolution is not about taking away choice, contract and consent or removing anything that is positive about the way the west has evolved; it is about analysing and understanding why things are as they are including oddities like the demand for segregation.\nHowever, we counter these demands with a positive celebration what the West could achieve if individuals controlled their personal behaviour and adopted a more coherent view of life based on the freedoms they enjoy, but with the practice of personal self-restraint. This Blue Revolution is in the minds of individuals and unlike past “Red” revolutions not in the head of the group, be that group a segregated one or not as the case may be.\n14.09.15 What should a Corby win mean for those of faith?\nThis may be a bit polemical but it is clear for the Labour Party that a coalition of the socially vulnerable, the ill-informed and the downright stupid have elected leaders of such breath-taking economic illiteracy that it is to be hoped that they never have control of the leavers of government. People of faith or no faith, people who value their freedom to live a moral life or faith based life, feel safe to hold their own opinions and express their genuine fears about the state of the world however they see it, should worry a little more now. There will be unwanted interference from a party, even in opposition, who have declared a will to tax high and disincentivise work, effort and profit and who will, more importantly, try and define and control the social and economic paradigm in a way never seen before; simply to maintain fear and build support. This will mean the views of the Labour movement or the spokes people at its head, determine what is politically acceptable or unacceptable, who is in and who is out; what is socially acceptable and what is not, all driven by naïve collectivist thinking influenced by goodness knows who.\nThere is no “capitalism” that needs bringing to heel; we are not living in the 1900’s. The changes that have been positive at least in part since the last world war, have delivered a socialism (Initially the catastrophic government ownership of business and industry then re distributing wealth and protecting the vulnerable). However, the socialist dream in Britain and the American dream in the USA have delivered from “Capitalism” a free market system that has many faults and flaws. It has given rise to the commodification of people, given rise to illegitimacy and substance abuse plus needless consumption and waste of the planet’s resources. As we at Blue Revolution are always trying to point out the solution to this “Secular Westernism” is not collectivism on an economic level or socialism or sharia law on a social level but for people to embrace freedom and responsibly; not a Corbyn Red Revolution but a Blue Revolution with no head just millions of freethinking intelligent moral minds.\n17.09.15 Modern Deadly Sin Number 6- Selfishness\nSelfishness is a socially corrosive behaviour and to many people it is not something they readily associate with themselves. However, selfishness must extend beyond the personal into the social sphere for it to be a deadly sin. It is not simply about putting yourself first by taking the last piece of cake, although clearly this is selfish too in certain circumstances; it is about living your life based on fulfilling your personal needs and desires without any consideration being given to others. Working in the public sector; retiring to Spain and returning when infirm to be cared for by the NHS is clearly an act of selfishness. Ignoring the needs of adult children in a world where challenges for them are great and their chances are limited by straightened economic circumstances is selfish if what wealth you have goes on holidays or cars; divorcing the partner with whom you have children of whom you has tired or no longer find attractive, is selfish.\nThere are many similar examples. Selfishness is linked to other modern sins such as Objectification (number 2) and Want Based Consumption (number 5). At its worst one must objectify others to overcome one’s own scruples about being selfish and more often than not selfishness is about having money for one’s own excessive personal over consumption.\nThe social and economic consequences of this sin is that we withdraw emotionally from wider society or indeed from our families. We cease to be socially active and therefore our positive beliefs and values become obscured by our preoccupation with applying these values to ourselves i.e. generosity, kindness etc. In practical terms this means have fewer volunteers to staff everything from Charity Shops to soup kitchens to community litter picks. We have fewer people to support and work with the vulnerable, we have more single parents for whom partnering to raise children is not a selfish enough lifestyle choice. We have children who are simply not wanted but were brought into the world because of the access they gave to resources, often taxpayers resources, to pay for tattoo’s, alcohol and drugs flats cars and houses. We have the elderly being looked after by the state.\nSelfishness which was once frowned upon by those of faith (and for some if recognised, still is) is like our previous modern deadly sins, a component of what we call Secular Westernism, It is something all good people of all faiths and none need to distance themselves from; so the right social values start to filter back into those parts of society which need them and people come to accept that whatever one has or does not have, we should never turn our backs on our widest responsibilities to others.\nTo make a positive change part of our Blue Revolution, it cannot be directed for us by the state but must come because we realise that our selfishness is bad for us but more importantly it is bad for our community, our society and gives a very poor impression of our Western culture.\n20.09.15 Men and women; has our creative tension gone toxic.\nThe more we at Blue Revolution kick the topic of “men and women” around; particularly when we stray from a purely European or US centric model of gender relations, the more some of the fundamental issues we have covered over the last six months or so can at a very basic level, be put at the door of poor inter sex relationships.\nThe Muslim faith is want to refer to “the role of women in Islam”; a very important role but one largely dependent on women accepting two principles: one being a woman’s role is essentially social in character rather than economic and the second being that a woman acts in line with the requirements of her faith as determined by her husband or father who in turn takes his advice from the local religious leader who is an expert in the Qur’an and hadith. Now there is little scope within Islam to be of a “reformed” persuasion. Hence, we think we get the confusion over Islam and extremism. From a secular western vantage point much of Islam seems extreme; and indeed, it perhaps is.\nIt seems that for many within the faith that the “reformed” can be construed as un-Islamic. Therefore, relations between the sexes are quite prescribed; but living amongst people of the Islamic faith in the UK one is struck by the overall sense of peace that applies to the Islamic community in general. When it works it works well, but perhaps not to every secular western taste or social appetite.\nWomen with hair covered marshal their usually largish brood with love and devotion whilst father is at the Islamic club, work or mosque. There is overall an acceptance that this a prescribed way of life and therefore dissatisfaction is both pointless and unacceptable. We suspect this is a fact lost by the left wing who whilst promoting the destruction of the family through a change in values engineered by tax and benefit arrangements, also buy in to the wider collectivist moral values of the Islamic faith.\nWhen one looks at the lives of women culturally through the ages one sees by modern standards some very barbaric treatment; some of which has become fetishized around faith or culture such as veiling, shrouding, stoning of “Harlots” and adulteresses, the dowry, arranged marriage, foot binding, neck coils, and FGM. This treatment of women which we at Blue Revolution have described as a form of “proto fascism” has evolved over many thousands of years and apart from the fact cultures differ, the intent seems to be the same; to control women, constrain them in a “patriarchal” hegemony t0 protect male wealth and or status. No wonder once women lose their cultural link to this type of hegemony in whatever form it takes and for them it ceases to have legitimacy, some can get politically angry whilst others seem to want a kind of revenge for patriarchy’s past ills of which the hapless males in their lives are often on the receiving end. Paradoxically some women seem to turn to Leninist socialism; the bedfellow of all moral collectivist ideologies. The majority however it seems to us at Blue Revolution simply revert to a kind of primitive reproductive behaviour which is neither moral, sustainable or fair; particularly on their children.\nIf anyone is reading this; you may be getting a little angry; we are not however advocating any return to patriarchy. Alternatively you may start recognising that there is something rather odd about a hegemonic patriarchal almost universally derided culture which was at its creation designed to preserve the species through male power and supply both the maximum amounts of social and economic value and whilst legitimately being thrown away has no obvious replacement. Now in the west patriarchy has been abandoned its loss throws up anomalies like industrial scale child illegitimacy, lone parents; the oddity of people step parenting other people’s children whilst someone step parents theirs, lonely grandparents locked out of families with the loss of social values lost to a generation and mentally ill fathers with little contact with their kids and the need to unlearn “love”, kids in cars being driven for “access” and so on and so forth.\nThe question therefore arises thus; is there something innately human and dare we say legitimate about this derided way of ordering society. After all it goes back to the days when humanity was wealth creating as it is now. Or is there something wrong with how we as a secular western society have managed the sexual revolution in the absence of any faith-based belief in the ways we did things in the past. Whatever your views, (and there will be many, most, we suspect conflicted at a social, political and psychological and personal level) it is in our opinion a good question. We will consider it and return to the topic later.\n29.09.15 The world drifting Left? -What does this mean.\nThe Pope is going left when it comes to an array of issues including global warming, world economics and migration; the Labour Party is giving up the “middle ground” and going left wing. They are taking with them an array of morally well-intentioned, but we think muddled individuals who amongst other things attack “gentrification” by “direct action” and claim to represent the “working classes”. From the perspective of Blue Revolution, the self-confessed left wing whether people of faith or not, are something of an oddity. Faith has always acted to influence personal behaviour and the outcome has generally been positive and generated social and economic value. Notwithstanding unacceptable by-products of discrimination against women and gays being in modern terms unacceptable but culturally specific, the benefits to the majority were all to obvious.\nThe differences between faiths have been essentially cultural but the unifying characteristic was the requirement to observe certain ways of conducting one’s self; one’s behaviour was required to conform to social rules to maximise societies survival. The rise of Secular Westernism has seen the west strip away any broad observance of moral as opposed to strictly legal behaviour. Britain’s New Labour specialised in the kind of “moral minimalism”.\nThe consequence has been the rise of issues which require state intervention to correct; the correction usually comes via welfare subsidies and the moral decline that is caused as a result, simply adds to the overall problem generation on generation. The solution adopted by right of centre governments is to restrict the availability of Government generosity; the so called “austerity agenda”. The problem is that unless there is a moral revival those who feel the loss under austerity and are “entitled” to support, become angry when the support is restricted, reduced or removed. This is in simple terms the cause of the rise of the left wing.\nThe problem however is that the modern left wing sees more Government as the solution. More Government means more government workers, more tax, more welfare and ultimately less opportunity, freedom and choice. If the Government was so good at planning and getting it right, we would stop the disaster of modern dating and relationships and ask the Government to find us our friends and mating partners. But we don’t and that tells us all we need to know.\nThe left really is old hat. The idea of the government stepping in may have been necessary in 1900 but today…it’s a quaint throwback to an era that we are never going to return to. There are problems with “the free market” but the solution is not “Leninist socialism”. We at Blue Revolution agree regulation is necessary to ensure the producer/providers relationship doesn’t overwhelm consumers. But, the main power for change is the mass choice of morally informed people who reject the lifestyle of Secular Westernism by their positive economic and social choices. At the same time, they should also reject any laughable idea that bureaucratic state socialism has anything positive to offer either. Go figure!\n01.10.15 Love me do…….But in the bar the piano man’s found another nail for my heart\nOne of our occasional contributors was listening to a radio show in Stoke on Trent in the UK and heard an interview with the 1970’s and 1980’s pop group Squeeze. The interviewer was apparently very excited about interviewing them asking questions about influences such as location in south London etc. What struck our contributor however was that the lyrics of the songs written by Squeeze in the 70’s and 80’s resonate with images of a life of disastrous relationships, unplanned babies, failed marriages and general emotional sorrow. Men (and women) of a certain age let us say 50 to 60 were weaned on the Beatles “Love me do” but too many have, in the last 30 years, had nails riven through their hearts. These songs perhaps speak to that generation. As he says what kind of society can be cold hearted enough to think that the emotional warmth of the loving union of two people can be thrown away on an almost industrial scale and somehow that society survive more than a couple of generations. We agree; and we believe it is another symptom of Secular Westernism and unless we all address it as individuals by being more coherently caring with each other we will all be “up the junction”. ”Now, is that love” we ask?\n02.10.15 Migration-can faith offer some hope?\nMigration is different and somehow the same as it has been for centuries. People moved away from the straight jacket of Catholicism as it was becoming a stifling brake on the aspirations of the motivated and proto entrepreneurial. In the past as we have said before the Catholic faith had a legitimate role for the poor as well as for the rich and a whole culture was based on faith and feast days, Matins, Vespers, Compline and the Latin mass. But this didn’t make a good basis for progressive social and economic development. The people who escaped from Britain and its Anglo Catholicism went to America and founded states and great cities. Their faith evolved but there was a faith that endured. Their faith required hard-work and self-reliance. Not the dogmatic certainty of rich men in castles and poor men at gates.\nToday we have again faith-based migration caused by what is seen as a predominantly political crisis engulfed in a war. This crisis as with earlier ones promises to engulf economies, societies and enduring certainties; yet for some reason it seems not to be called a faith-based migration. But the more we look at it here at Blue Revolution the more it is clear that this is exactly what it is. People are fleeing warring tribes in Iraq, ISIS in Syria, they are leaving repressive regimes but in all these scenarios they are leaving a religious faith that is unyielding to the demands of modern economic progress. Thus, we have western attired youths and young people who are escaping the confines of Islam…not abandoning their faith but finding a place where their Islamic faith is more compatible with their own desires and aspirations. They are for this reason clearly more “economic” migrant than refugee….although there are many of them too.\nSo, looking at this as a crisis within a faith specifically Islam a number of suggestions can be offered; Places we call “dust bowl” Islamic countries need to see these migrations as evidence that there countries need to move from the 16th century to perhaps the 19th. Establish principles such as Contract, Choice and Consent as the basis of a slow move towards democracy.\nCountries that are currently repressive 19th and early 20th Century in the way they maintain order i.e. through bureaucracy, repression and lack of accountability, need to move forward to the 21st century, promoting human rights and freedoms irrespective of gender, sexuality etc. Saudi Arabia falls into the first category, Assad’s Syria the second. Much of Africa is in the former category. The western world’s fetishizing of “Democracy” needs to be tempered by the realism that until people can freely support themselves within their societies and to create economic value through contract, choice and consent; democracy will simply be a pipe dream. We think Putin gets this point better than western leaders.\nIs there a word of caution in all of this; well of course there is. Firstly, the countries from whom the migrants flee are the cause of their problems; not the countries to which they wish to migrate. Migration can be temporary as technology and transport remove the enforced permanent geographical and cultural separation migrants endured in the past; think air and sea travel, Skype and the internet; forces for good as well as mischief. But there is a lesson in all this for the west too. As we at Blue Revolution are always saying Secular Westernism is a cultural aberration caused by a lack of personal moral behaviour within a liberal economic framework and thus not fully worthy of the title civilised. For those people of faith who come to the west we must accept that many of them will find our culture deeply troubling. Rather than assuming they are wrong why don’t we accept they have a point and adopt the principles of the Blue Revolution to ensure we can accommodate people of all faiths and none.\n07.10.15 Dust bowl economics in Britain- some mistake surely\nThe conference season has come to an end, thankfully! What are our observations? Well Tim Farron gave the most passionate speech about migration, wonderfully delivered but unfortunately it lacked the smack of realism; a kind of German welcome without the jobs or the infrastructure. Labour were back on the old socialist treadmill; sucking up value created by working people and spending it on government projects to help, well the government; government employees, and perhaps the army of people who have been undermined by years of moral minimalism at the hands of New Labour. These sad and vulnerable people now lack not only skills, but the values that make work the first thought in the morning rather than the thought dismissed as the duvet goes back over the head at eleven PM. We understand what causes this problem it’s the secular nature of modern western culture; secular westernism as we call it.\nAs for the Conservative party; we would prefer to refer critically to what we view as a policy designed to appeal to the imagined “middle ground” but which has as much moral substance as borrowing from the future to pay for the excess of the present; we refer of course to the myth of home ownership and the destruction of lands productive food value.\nNow let us define our terms; we at Blue Revolution are only concerned with value; social and economic. Value is inherent in land, as it is in people’s productive capacity both for economic production and the production of social value in the form of cohesive behaviour that promotes the survival of the group be it family, tribe, country, kingdom or empire.\nTaking a piece of unproductive land and building housing on it allows that land to realise some social value as well as create some wealth. As unproductive land it has the actual food producing value of a piece of rock. However, take some fertile farmland that gives up it produce in the form of food value and you turn a repeating cycle of value into merely wealth. That wealth might increase, but the food value inherent in the land is gone. Even open unfarmed land has some social value as recreation. So, if you promote house building on farmland, are you really creating anything of real economic value or is it simply a case of creating wealth, which simply feeds the monster of secular westernism? Paying as it does for consumption and with that all that the secular market offers but which has no discernible social or economic value.\nThis is the “dust bowl” economics in the west. Whilst the moral outcomes are not inhumane, the process is like that of the oil rich states; you take value out of the ground and use it to prop up an increasingly unsustainable economic model. As you do this people become more dependent on the valueless wealth and entitled to receive it and the whole socio/economic model becomes utterly incoherent, unable to pay its way in the long term. Incidentally we also feel that the Conservatives “own rather than rent” policy drives the same kind of incoherence; trapping people into wealth generating “homes” which simply feed the desire to consume unsustainably. We agree that all forms of home ownership and good quality tenancies are legitimate; but the government has no place interfering in the market at all. Germany does a lot better than us because there the economy produces value rather than using home ownership to generate wealth.\nOh, and all the above explains why socialism is the ideology of the past and has no place in anyone’s future. Socialists only speak of wealth; they have regrettably lost all notion of value. But expanding on that, is a post in its own right.\n13.10.15 Labour and Conservatives; what if anything do, they have in common?\nMost notably they both define their economics in terms of the nation’s wealth, its creation and distribution as opposed to the nations value its creation and distribution. Wealth has become a shorthand for value but is it?\nThey have differences of perspective of course but they are economically less striking than they at first appear. Since Adam Smith first penned his “Wealth of Nations” the term wealth creation has become the shorthand for what economies should do; they create wealth don’t they? Politics of course is about how governments manage the nation’s wealth and how and to whom they distribute it.\nThose who read the Blue Revolution posts will possibly be aware we very rarely refer to wealth, preferring the term value. Value has two essential types; social and economic. Social value is about the capacity of a society to behave in a stable way within the economic context which defines how economic value is created. The creation of economic value is determined by the way society mixes the resources (land, labour, money and skill) necessary to feed and support its people. Both types of value are connected but to really appreciate the raw necessity of this link we need to look at tribal society.\nTribes are simple societies, but they have faith in and are compliant with their tribal system which defines everything from the age at which one comes of age and what one is expected to do at that age, to how food is acquired and consumed. Value therefore is about how we maintain ourselves within a stable community based (hopefully) on a shared belief system. Beliefs which are necessary to maximise social and economic value.\nWealth on the other hand is not what a tribal society had to worry about managing, they don’t generate wealth.\nSimple wealth arises when one is able to generate more value than is required by society and then having created it, store it and accumulate it…..storing it became easier with the discovery of precious stones, gold and silver. As we said above to get to even simple wealth creation you must generate more economic value than you need. Once this has happened the next stage of development is politics because wealth can be controlled and does not have to be distributed. Unlike the cave man dragging the valuable carcass of an antelope into the tribal compound to be consumed by all before it rotted; wealth could be stored, managed, and therefore controlled. The person who controlled wealth had power, power to hang on to it all or give a portion of the stored value on those who served them. Their wealth conferred for loyalty would be used to buy food shelter etc.\nNow this simple wealth has a strong link with value; because simple wealth is an accumulation of actual economic value. Our early political evolution was essentially a process by which we argued about to whom simple wealth was distributed; feudal overlord or merchant trader. later, Marxism was about the distribution of wealth and the need to change the whole social and economic system to achieve a fair distribution to those “workers” who create the wealth, rather than the “capitalists” who it was claimed exploited the “workers”.\nThe above is a whirlwind trip through the history of faith, society and economics all three sort of linked in a somewhat wobbly but coherent progression. So far so good but what has it to do with modern politicians. By the time Karl Marx was writing the obvious abuses of wealth accumulation were hard to avoid. Poor people were working to create wealth for the rich and suffering extreme poverty as their reward. Not even tribal society with its gender defined roles and tribal mutilations was responsible for such extreme differences in what people had within the same community. Hence Marxism’s claim that capital is misappropriated by capitalists under a cloak of contract and consent.\nAnyway; how can we pull this together and answer the question above? Well once we were able to escape the tyranny of wealth based directly on actual use value and we developed ways of creating wealth based on smaller and smaller amounts of real value and politically wealth distribution and consumption became a social pre occupation, we were able to use some of this largely valueless wealth to “speculate” on the future. Borrow and pay back tomorrow, buy now and sell at a higher price later. Then even more recently take something of no actual value (stocks and Shares?) and sell them for money borrowed from banks by the person who buys them or in the case of ‘shorting’ borrow the shares themselves. Once we have got to this point wealth bears no discernible link to value and is indeed a froth on the surface of a very impoverished economy paying for a slowly diminishing society. We call this secular westernism, others casino economics\nIt remains the objective of modern secular western politicians to oversee societies which create and distribute “wealth”. Both Conservatives and Labour old and new are interested in wealth and its redistribution; But what relationship does this wealth have to social and economic value. We at Blue Revolution suggest very little. Broadly but not exclusively government has taken on a role generating wealth via Quantitative Easing and spending to create a budget deficit if. The banking system, house building, increasing house and stock values creating wealth too. Both are in very simple terms ways of manufacturing wealth rather than creating value. Of course, this is a very simple model; it ignores things like low interest rates as a positive way of driving progress, stock issues as a way of facilitating investment and the need for a complex society to have underpinning it a complex and accessible economy. It also ignores the role of the rest of the world producing the value we no longer can, perhaps because we simply have too many unproductive people here in the west a consequence of capitalism’s failure and evolution into a free market.\nWe at Blue Revolution believe that what western society needs is to get closer to creating proper value; even if we are poorer in terms of our apparent wealth for doing it. We believe we will be happier as a result. This is the basis of our Blue Revolution; moral renewal and value creation by proper un-gendered social and economic endeavour. We will explore this later and explore what we can all do to become a Blue Revolutionary.\n17.10.15 What might happen if women lose their biologically and sociologically defined role as child bearers and mothers?\nAll faiths and even many of no faith; governments and other groups continue to promote a biological and sociological role for women; encouraged with varying degrees of emphasis or compulsion by the welfare based incentives offered in the west to the threat of punishment up to and including execution for those who fail to deliver on this “expectation” elsewhere. We have described the historical treatment of women by early culture as “proto fascism” and when the reality of past women’s lives are examined that term seems to acquire serious relevance today; particularly in places like the definitive dust bowl economy that got lucky; modern Saudi Arabia with its ancient gender and faith obsessions parading as civilised behaviour in the twenty first century. No chance of women in Saudi being given choices to re-evaluate what is a biological accident but which determining a thoroughly ghastly sociological reality. Anyway, we have Blue Revolution observe more interesting places that Saudi Arabia and Japan is one such place.\nOn the face of it Japan probably doesn’t strike one as being of much of interest to the secular western populations in Europe and the US; less of an economic power house more of a post-industrial society settling down to the reality of declining influence and exposure to the exhausting effects of global competition. A bit like us in the west. However according to what we have been told there is a sociological phenomenon taking place in Japan which is quite fascinating and probably needs some Blue Revolution evaluation; men in Japan in the critical 20 to 40 year old demographic are losing their interest in sex; at least sex with other people.\nWe would vouch that when you empower women and they are able to assume an economic role as opposed to following the pre-determined path towards motherhood; the effects on men is to turn sex into simply another narcotic experience; and for the Japanese and I would suggest the more protestant inclined amongst the Christian community plus others, this “narcotic effect” of sexual behaviour in not worth the complex sociological and psychological consequences on men of getting tangled up in unnecessarily complex relationships. The relationship with a woman who is economically independent would become like that of any good friend. Is this a good thing or a bad thing we ask?\nWell anything which gets away from the biological predetermination based on sex and gives people real as opposed to an imagined “choice” about their lives, has to be good; so long as they work to create the social and economic value necessary to support them and their community. It also has the effect of reducing carbon emissions and is kinder to the planet. With fewer people the planet might stand a chance of recovering from the combined effects of carbon dioxide, monoxide, methane, sewage and plastic bags. The oddest phenomenon for us is the sight of the right on earth parent with seven children who wants to save the planet. No chance.\nSo, to conclude our latest rant; what is our conclusion. Well bring it on. Reduce the incentives for women to have babies; there are enough people in the world having children in cultures where sex is for reproduction rather than for the narcotic effects, we in the west “enjoy” and obsess about. There will be fewer by products often paid for by an unwilling taxpayer to parents who would have been better off drinking a strong coffee or doing some aerobic exercise or simply “sorting themselves out”. The longer we continue to define a woman’s role in religious terms and engineer a welfare system to support it within a culture that sees reproductive sex with someone else as a recreational entitlement, the bigger our problems will be in the longer term, economically, sociologically and environmentally.\n26.10.15 Feminism and the obsession with the biological role of women- Why not join the patriarchy\nFeminists including the sainted Germaine Greer obsess about “women’s experience” as though it unalterably different from men’s experience. In some specific situations it is, but really, we are talking about some specific instances. Ms Greer who we at Blue Revolution understand is something of an apologist for the cultural barbarity of FGM, overlooks the fact this is a practice that is intended to lock women from traditional societies into a subservient social and biological role, in contrast to the more “important” male role of ‘economic’ provider. If it happens here in the west it is because we have helped establish the absurd idea that all cultures are equal without the qualification as to how we might measure equality. This is Ms Greer’s problem. Cultures are only equal in the sense they provide the framework for the creation of social and economic value. In simple societies and ones that separate sex for cultural reasons this is gender based. How cultures justify this is either coherent to the means their society has of creating social and economic value i.e. it makes sense socially and economically; for example men and women’s segregation in 7th century Arabia; or it is totally at odds with how value, social and economic is created and preserved today.\nIf any modern society or feminist commentator, observes the pre-eminent role of women as “biological and social” and in the case of government this perspective gets props up with the support of a welfare system that reinforces women’s biological rather than economic role, they are over playing the significance of the role women have been fighting to escape from for centuries.\nIn the west biological and economic roles are hard to combine effectively; hence past discrimination. By supporting the biological and social role of women, sympathisers such as Ms Greer are setting a trap for western women that many cultures of the world would like western women to fall into (Saudi Arabia anyone?). They are, without even being aware of it, aligning women with the patriarchs of male hegemony; seeing women in purely biological and social roles; from which here in the west, it is all too easy to fall. Our broken families attest to the challenge of combining so many roles.\nMs Greer’s views on transgendered people is illustrative of the point. Gender is irrelevant unless you see people as social and economic gender specific terms. If you see people as a mix of social and economic and that the mix is determined by them and by no one else, the women’s experience for those who opt for an economic role becomes no different from that of men and people who are transgendered. You work, you contribute to society (be a good citizen) you die. It really is time we started to ignore the ideological academics who capture a view that bears little relevance to reality and in its pretence is a dangerous distraction from the aim of creating first gender and then genuine faith and cultural equality. This gender equality of course must be distinguished from the transactivism agenda. Even if equal they are still biologically women as distinct from biologically male.\n28.10.15 America-a country in need of help?\nJohn Kerry believes that the world is an angry place; people are angry he has said; the flood of people from Syria and Libya and other places in Africa reflects a flee not just to wealthier economies but from the anger of War and hard-line Islam. In America gun crime and the all too predictable schoolboy shootouts continue as evidence of individual bursts of insane anger by a collection of sad and lonely misfits.\nIn the UK the anger feels less pronounced but bubbles up with either nationalism or socialism amongst the more political, its effects mitigated elsewhere by a welfare system which promotes for too many citizens “self-actualisation” through survival by fornication and the consumption of welfare income. This promotes a pointless hamster wheel lifestyle for too many Britons that achieves little but is unlikely to generate too much in the way of revolution, as it dampens rage, but also delivers little or no social or economic value.\nCompared to the US the UK has also managed to avoid some of the pitfalls that have both positively and negatively shaped America, its economy and faith. America has a frontier mentality, something which is sublimated in the form of the “American Dream”.\nWhereas the class system in a country like the UK has placed a psychological limit on what citizens believed they were entitled to achieve, in America there is no such constraint and failure is very personal. Whilst class has lost much of its relevance in the UK it has left something of a perverse legacy and people are less inclined to “self- pathologize” their failure, the welfare system assists them to adapt by expecting very little of them for the welfare they receive. They can of course blame the Tory government.\nWhilst the value created by the British economy is like all western economies much lower than the wealth it can generate via its banking system, the effects of the old class system and the generosity of the welfare system take the sting out of peoples sense of personal failure.\nThe role of the economy in creating “wealth” as opposed to “value” is a major contributor to American anger. Wealth is fluid and can like fluid flow only through channels created by people. In America these channels are manufactured by the leaders of the financial system and direct the wealth to those within the system. It is not as American Senator Bernie Sanders says a “casino” system….that is too random. It is a system like the political system in America, designed to maintain the status quo. The old-fashioned Marxist term “Hegemony” i.e. an enclosed system which operates to benefit only certain privileged groups, applies to America more than any other western country. Unlike the UK there is no generous welfare system softening the blow of low achievement and failure.\nWhat the US hegemony delivers, or so we at Blue Revolution believe , is a situation where the poorest become angry and polarised, with low expectations poor state schooling and poor health. Unwilling to accept their personal failure they turn on each other hostile to black people, white people, Hispanics, Jews, Freemasons or just those who seem to be able to ride the wave of wealth that flows through the American economy. The geeky conspiracy theorist no different from the KKK fanatic in the speed at which they get legitimately angry but ignorantly willing to blame another group often irrationally. If one can’t understand what is going on it is easy to be empowered by blaming another racial group.\nPoliticians who have to tap into banker’s wealth to get re-elected and who then get richer on state and federal finance are seen as part of the greater American problem.\nLike the other countries of the west, social value has been supplanted by an obsession with creating mere wealth. In the US more than elsewhere this alchemy of wealth creation doesn’t benefit all people, only the “elite” and the Government. The elite being those who are born into or have made it into this system. Now one point implicit in what we have said but not made explicit yet, is that those who see themselves as the human failures in the American system are genuinely failures of the system. There is no attempt to empower them, educate them, or even wrap them in numbing welfare. They are ghettoised and imprisoned become racists or gangsters determined perhaps to achieve the American dream by making others the failures in their own closed system.\nAll criminals are vulnerable and entitled in the way they achieve status at the expense of others. Prison gets them out of the way but doesn’t take away the “hegemony”; of being in an enclosed system of alienation and poverty, discrimination and abuse to rival the worst third world ghetto.\nThe UK has less of these American problems too because it has a sane attitude towards guns, preventing for the most part those who do become insanely angry about their loss of economic position and opportunity the option of shooting up other people.\nEssentially America espouses bourgeois freedoms which create expectations but offer a system to fulfil them which creates not value but wealth, which is then channelled into the hands of bankers, stockbrokers and those commissioned by government to create weapons to reflect American status on the world stage. The poor in America don’t have the cushioning or numbing effects of seventy years’ worth of welfare, they don’t have a culture that at least is well intentioned if not always successful in driving social progress and inclusion. Whilst the UK has to row back a little in terms of the numbing effects of welfare and like America and the west has to get away from mere wealth creation and move towards a value-based economy.\nAmerica has to move towards a system which is probably unaffordable given the extent of the people problem, ignorance, obesity anger, conspiracy and vested interest up to and including government contracts and political influence mean that for America Secular Westernism will be a hard ideology to shift.\n02.11.15 Do we need a revolution? if so, what type should it be? Red or Blue?\nSome wag once commented that there was no such thing as a free lunch. There is certainly no such thing as a free revolution. Whichever past revolution one selects there is mayhem; destruction, death and the promotion of one special interest group over another, someone pays!\nRevolution, it seems to us at Blue Revolution ushers in one repressive regime, often ousting something out of date muddled and incoherent, but replacing it with something, perhaps more coherent but, if not at least as bad in the short term probably considerably worse. Why this might be is not altogether clear to us (we are not academics, historians etc) but of course things settle down eventually, once society recovers from the “birth pain” of the new order.\nOver the last 2000 years we have progressed in fits and starts but not without pain and bloodshed on mankind’s muddled revolutionary journey.\nIf we look at what is going on now (early 21 century) we see that there are, demographic, religious, economic, political and gender-based tensions, accompanied by a demand for “change” and “something must be done” growing ever shriller.\nWe at Blue Revolution have written about this global anger and have stressed the need to finally move away from economic, racial and biological determinants of social class, caste and position as the best way of healing society and moving us all forward. We thought we had put aside western class-based determinants of social position, but, whilst significantly diminished they are still here, and they too need finally addressing. But how?\nThere are people; and groups of people who would like to engage us all in violent revolution based on the overthrow of the dimming embers of our current class and establishment paradigm. This old-fashioned approach however owes too much to the past and too little to the future. These people seem to demand a spitting and shouting, burning and destroying with Red style Revolution. They, like we, see the fault lines in the west….they see our “Secular Westernism” for example not as a product of the interplay of numerous forces including global economics coupled with faulty individual moral choice and poor judgement, but as the product of a corrupt and corrupting economic system. They want a violent struggle and an overthrow of the past to replace the hated rule of the “corrupt elite” (Banks, right wing governments, industrial conglomerates and Stock holders in particular) with the rule of errrrr…..an elite force of well-intentioned and informed super moral people in super moral governments all somehow financed and licenced to guide plan and steer our lives . However, they don’t stop and think that as part of the past, these people if appointed, would like the rest of us, be part of the problem not the solution. Power, control setting the agenda, limiting freedom would simply replace wealth, control, marketing and restricting opportunities through exclusion.\nThe Red Revolutionaries do have a point…Secular Westernism is bad….it is particularly bad for those at the tail end of societies, societies which are today as corrosive psychologically and socially as in Victorian times the faith- based counterpart was corrosive physically and socially.\nSecular Westernism leads to a moral vacuum corrupting those who have neither the stamina or the self-esteem to hold their nerve, having to manage their lives within its marketplace of unavoidable levels of economic and social uncertainty.\nThe State to mitigate the effects of this moral vacuum has, rather like the Christian faiths of old, provided security, a welfare as opposed to spiritual security that makes the system seem legitimate in the minds of the most vulnerable. This is particularly true of the UK but also to a lesser degree America and elsewhere. So why the current high levels of anger?\nThe west has created a global free market with consumption at its heart……for us therefore it is not capitalist we have moved beyond “Capitalist”. We are now buccaneering free marketeers.\nCapital has actual value owned and controlled by, well “Capitalists”. It is stretching a point too far to say that a made-up stream of central bank, government and credit based ‘funny money’ sloshing around the globe is “Capitalist” in character. There is little real capital around anymore. What we have are systems of wealth creation and wealth allocation which favour certain groups at the expense of others. Some mitigation through welfare is possible, but essentially the free market is both the cause and the cure of the problem. The “problem” being defined as too few people having too much money backed by too little if any real value.\nWhoever you look at who has “loadsamoney” be it Beckham or Trump, pop stars and celebrities, or a person who made their millions selling personalised this or tat related that, the truth is that they have far more money than there is value behind their money; and therein lies the dilemma for our “revolutionaries”. What exactly is being “reallocated” in the revolution…….”funny money!!”\nWhat the Red revolutionaries seem intent on doing; depending on which one you listen to, is empower the government to do what the financial and other markets currently do, but to do it for the benefit of the poor. However as with previous revolutions if they simply replace one busted system with another version of the same system, they fail to progress society and in the case of our spitting taunting shouting and burning Red Revolutionaries they will replace one group of power and wealth grabbers (let’s say Bankers) paid for with funny money with another, let’s say state officials, paid for by funny money. The moral hazard associated with this funny money continuing to make people both idle and entitled and increasingly unproductive. The process will survive until the Government, or rather the people go under. Not so different than the current risk of individuals eventually going under. Same destination….different route and scale so to speak.\nNow here at Blue Revolution HQ the Blue Revolution approach is just as radical but considerably more difficult to explain, but we think better informed. Of course anyone who reads our posts will know we are no fans of the corrosion inflicted by Secular Westernism, with it’s under regulated global free market undermining personal and public morals. Its lack of moral hazard forging societies which don’t resemble civilizations and alienate and makes enemies of people who, quite understandably, but illogically, find answers to the west’s problems in old world type discriminations. People for whom control and discrimination (gender, faith racial sexual orientation, nationality etc.) are the solution and who all too often and perversely become the bedfellows of the Red Revolution as they all want to “change the system” by force.\nThe Blue Revolution takes as its starting point the fact that wealth and value share little in common these days. They have since we learnt to store value been different; one depending on the other (wealth depending on value) but in a ratio which was on a human scale. Now wealth is out of control and is consuming value as fast as it can be pumped out of the ground, harvested, built over or manufactured. The slush of wealth corrupts life and bloats expectations, creating the moral vacuum in which we all co-exist and which taints all of us.\nThe Blue Revolution is not a violent revolution, it is the nearest thing to a free lunch. It asks everyone who can think and has the capacity to control and modify their behaviour to do so on the basis of certain principles; down scaling expectations, have belief in the capacity of people to do good and actually do good; behave in a thoughtful and moral way putting back and not just taking out. An act of kindness, selfless and unrewarded is the simplest form of “value added”. Recognise that wealth, our wealth and that of others, is of no value unless it is backed up by hard work rather than luck, over confidence and the vagaries of the market.\nWe must also moreover recognise that if the Government must bail us out it is the nation’s people bailing ourselves out. With better regulation by government we as consumers can use our power to influence the market, to bring about the necessary change in the hope our improved outlook translates via the free market into change and acts to inspire others.\nThe Blue Revolution is the real “power to the people” not a committee of ministers and senior Civil Servants with over publicised agitators, acting on behalf of the people. We have this power because we have the free markets, the last thing we want is that power diminished by a traditional left wing, well intentioned, ill-informed but creating an emboldened state. The state for all its positives, when it becomes too powerful, will make too many of us just a little angrier, and some people are angry enough.\n05.11.15 The final deadly Sin: Immodesty\nWe started this process of describing the modern “seven deadly Sins back in April 2015. The idea was to link some personal behaviours over which we all have control to the concept of corrupting “Secular Westernism” which is the Blue Revolution description of the self-destructive “it’s all about me” morality that undermines western culture.\nThe idea is to try and make the point that many of us will have taken our freedom and with it contributed to the decline of western standards of public morality. The consequence is in our view a reduction in social and economic value, both of which are essential for the health and sustainability of all economies and communities. In the west wealth has become a very poor substitute for social and economic value. However, wealth unlike social and economic value flows into the hands of too few people. The solution is not to redistribute wealth but to demand the creation of social and economic value; the Blue Revolution so to speak.\nOur seven deadly sins are global sins, but they are particularly relevant to the modern western culture. They leave individuals at risk of being exploited and yet also prone to exploit others. The western world’s global “Hegemony” based as it is on creating too much valueless wealth, makes sinners of too many of us. Of relevance is our final Sin.\nOur final is also our most widely committed and most controversial sin although by no means our worst; it is immodesty. Let us examine this in more detail beginning with immodesty in places where you may not expect to see it.\nModesty is a universal requirement of faith. Most if not all faiths require us to cover up, be calm and temperate, and to behave in a modest and restrained way. Virtually every culture in the modern world has found a way around this, (it is in many ways the most pervasive of sin) and it includes the immodest braying of fundamentalists of all hues.\nIn Africa and the Middle East, the hateful criticism of other faiths and ways of life from Christians criticizing Gays to the Sunni Muslim Monarchy in Saudi Arabia banning all other faiths but Islam. American televangelists promising wealth and salvation if you part with your money. Each shows an arrogance that is ill befitting of faith; a self-regard and easy default position that everyone else is wrong. Ones sympathy with the North African Migrants starts to evaporate when one observes young men swaggering across Europe demanding a new life uninvited, aggressive and bearing the entitled attitude and angry expression of our own entitled from top publicly paid officials like MP’s to bankers to some welfare recipients.\nThe ancient behaviours of averting one’s eyes and prostrating oneself, open palm gestures and respectful speech, modest dress codes etc which in the west became symbolic of “good manners” all show how important it is to show respect through modest behaviour. Modesty really is universal. To behave in a modest way promotes social harmony and cohesion and a respect for others within and outside our personal relationships. It also promotes a positive and safe social context within which crime could be much lower and economic and social activity would be much higher. In a world of gender equality such as we have in the west, the biggest threat to the individual comes from their own and others immodest behaviour. So, to all we would encourage a revival of modesty in cultural and economic life.\nAny discussion of immodesty can’t ignore the fact that when it comes to industrial scale immodesty it becomes “part of our way of life” and it undermines us in the eyes of others. No one in modern times does immodesty quite like “the west”. Immodesty promoted via the internet is a blind spot for the individuals and the western culture in general. We are all ‘at it’.\nWe don’t want to labour the obvious point but people from most cultures who observe the west see nakedness as a symptom of something going badly wrong, particularly when the wests sexually saturated culture is viewed as both arousing and yet repellent by a more traditional world.\nThe freedoms we enjoy, our generally fair treatment of one another, our belief that people can reform, and should be treated with compassion are all overlooked as the focus moves onto our casual attitudes towards marriage and relationships, our pornography our widespread obsession with looks and celebrity. Cure this and the west will genuinely become a good and moral place unequalled for fairness, respect and equality. But if to “cure it” means taking away the freedom to do immodest things and behave in an immodest way then it’s not worth it. This is rule book morality a regime. Therefore, we can’t expect government to “put things right”; it is up to us.\nThe answer is, as with all our sins, simply not to indulge in them. The Blue Revolution is not about telling people what to do but is about showing anyone who is interested that to preserve the best of what we have we need to avoid the worst places that our culture will allow us to go. If I am modest in what I do it may rub off and other people may be modest in what they do.\nAs a society if we begin to control our behaviour, our generally good culture will become better. Over time a culture which unfortunately encourages some of us to misbehave will slowly modify; a process of slow almost invisible change will take place.\nThe world which discriminates and abuses to enforce moral behaviour will observe that in the west you don’t have to mutilate and punish, discriminate and control, kill and maim to ensure that society creates the maximum amount of social and economic value possible; it happens because in the west we have grown out of the impulse to be immodest. Evidence of this can be measured by the extent to which we have exorcised the demons of celebrity and gross planet consuming over consumption. Let us start this revolution now. Lets avoid the seven modern deadly sins.\n10.11.15 The great immigration debate- good or bad?\nDavid Cameron the UK Prime Minister has spelt out that he believes the basis of the UK’s negotiation with the EU should be prior to the much-vaunted referendum sometime between May 2016 and Nov 2017. The four negotiating points consist of the political, social and economic but without doubt the most controversial contains elements of all three. His demand to limit the access to “in work” benefits for migrant workers is causing ripples of applause and muted heckling from both sides of the debate. Too radical for some not radical enough for others. As we move towards the referendum, we at Blue Revolution will give an opinion on in or out; however, for the moment let us consider the immigration issue.\nThere is no doubt that the shift from “free movement of labour” to the “free movement of people” has caused a gearing up of numbers coming here from Eastern Europe. However, we must not forget that in the 1970’s and 1980’s the flow of Labour was from Britain to amongst other places Germany and from the 1990’s onwards the free movement of people was to amongst other places Spain and France. We have taken advantage of the borderless arrangements in Europe so should not be surprised when others want to come here. Left leaning Policy forums are claiming that in addition to the principle of free movement being a good thing as we benefit from it too, migrants also “add value to the British economy”. Now this is a very controversial claim…or so we think.\nFirstly, anyone familiar with Blue Revolution will know we are a little obsessed with “Value”. For us the whole purpose of society is to create social and economic value to enable the survival of our culture and in the west to ensure the continuation of equality, consent, choice and contract as the heart of an expanded democracy. To ensure this we need to avoid the pitfalls and temptations of secular westernism and the seven deadly sins. So how does migration interface with our aspirations for western culture as experienced in the UK….it will be different in other places of course.\nIn the UK we have a culture and economy which is heavily reliant on the state to provide income for workers, services for service users and benefits for those who are unable or unwilling to work. Housing, education, and heath provide a minimum level of intervention for those who need it and we have a humane and fair system of justice with help for those in need. We are however burdened by an economy which has driven out skill and driven down wages to the minimum and locks those wage levels in place with a supply of willing labour; keen to benefit from the above. This arrangement suits too many people in different ways. The welfare recipients don’t have to work; wages are too low to incentivise gainful employment and in any event if you have to claim “Tax Credits” rather than out of work benefits, you won’t be so much better off, so it fails to make that early morning start in mid-winter worthwhile.\nThe rest of the stuff on offer; healthcare etc, is available to everyone anyway, worker or not. So, within the context of employment there is a major downside to mass immigration a downside in the form of depressed wages, British workers or potential workers dislocated by choice and from the active labour market. This is an unforeseen social engineering nightmare the social costs of which are pregnancy, single parenthood, depressed adults, low aspiration and unemployment. If there were less mass immigration wage levels would be driven up and there would be benefits to the economy and society. There would be greater levels employment amongst the indigenous British due to higher wages and there would be lower levels of the social problems identified above.\nThat it is the “left” who peddle the notion that immigration from Eastern Europe is positive is slightly perverse.\nWhat the left fail to take into account of is that the wealth distributed in welfare to migrant workers does not create economic value, simply personal wealth and company profits, through subsidize low wages, and it adversely drives out for many British people their capacity to maintain high levels of social value independence, resilience and social responsibility for example. Less widely discussed but also relevant is the issue of housing demand; arguably we need more housing to house both migrant workers as well as our own economically inactive people many of whom have children and come from broken families. We also have our workers to house many of whom also have broken families too. Perversely house building and a ‘buoyant’ housing market create the illusion of economic growth; hence the governments obsession with it. Of course, this analysis we believe applies to Germany and France Sweden as well as the UK.\nWhat about the other “old Chestnut” immigration as a driver for genuine economic growth? We have referred to housing demand creating an impression of real growth, but in our opinion house building has simply short-term benefits and does not add long term value. Housing feeds into the asset inflation mirage of growth, looks good on paper but like stock values is just froth, masquerading as real value. growth. Economic growth therefore must be more than building houses for a growing population of those with housing needs including migrants.\nHaving to understand the term migrant is also a challenge. There are many types, (EU, Non-EU, Illegal immigrant, Refugee, Student, legitimate non-EU immigrant, Asylum Seeker) but the group almost universally cited by left and right wing alike as having had a positive impact (i.e. value creating) is the pre-war migrant who “made good” and contributed to Britain’s post war economic boom. These were predominantly Jewish migrants fleeing Nazi Germany.\nIn the context of modern migration this clam needs some analysis. Firstly, we do believe that the post war economy grew as a result of pre-war immigration. Highly skilled men and women with ability who were driven from their homes by a genocidal regime and came to Britain escaping to freedom, created value both social and economic. Many were wealthy and well connected and talented; but not exclusively so. These migrants are used as evidence to support the idea of widespread mass immigration today. But regrettably the situation is not the same. Much as the political class wish it were.\nModern migrants are not on the whole wealthy or highly skilled…of course there are some who are. They are also coming here in huge numbers far greater than in the past. Many fleeing crumbling economies in North Africa bring their faith which has different expectations of how as a society Britain should create and preserve its economic and social value offering a rule-based regime with expectations and entitlements based on sex for example or tradition such as halal slaughter. For many of these newly arrived there is too much reliance on the service and hospitality sector and within this overcrowded sector a reliance develops on government financial business support.\nSo, what are we left with? There is no doubt migration can be very positive. The value of migration to the British economy and society in general depends upon who is coming and what values and skills they bring with them as well as how many come. To detach the issue from social and economic realities of value creation and preservation as the “something must be done” people or the immigration is simply about ‘diversity’ people believe, is utterly naïve. There is evidence of good and bad in respect of migration, but you need to look more analytically at what is really going on socially as well as economically.\nWhat seems interesting to us is that with modern technology and transport there is no need for people to leave their culture of origin; they can connect and re connect anywhere and whilst this may promote a view that the host culture is alien and needs change it also allows the notion of location to be separated from the notion of nationality and cultural identity. In many ways we are free to be anywhere and the idea that we have to locate permanently anywhere is absurd, if you can’t cut it socially and economically where you are… it is not that difficult to go home and maybe you should not have left in the first place.\n13.11.15 Jihadi John and moral confusion; can we help?\nJihadi John killed in a drone attack; one view is good riddance the other regrets the lack of a trial and “proper” justice. two conflicted views. The Americans show the usual lack of restraint and treat the death of one pathetic if psychotic individual as though it is the climax of the battle and in so doing demonstrate exactly the kind of western hubris that should antagonises people on all sides of the moral debate as well as unintentionally harden the resolve of ISIS to get their own back. Tone it down a bit guys!\nThere are enough innocent westerners in these war zones to kidnap and behead to avenge the death of Jihadi John, so we should show restraint in our success to avoid provoking more bloodletting. One of our Seven Deadly Sins (the things that make modern western culture problematic to those of all faith and some of no faith) is immodesty and it is a characteristic of the swaggering ISIS too. Irrespective of the way he was dispatched, we should restrain our impulse to gloat at his death. He represented nothing good and his death should not be significant either.\nNow the subject of whether we should have put him on trial rather than execution by drone is interesting we think; The liberals in the west and ISIS themselves should not necessarily expect a proper trial for people like Jihadi John. Jihadi John lived in a chaotic and cruel dustbowl. A place where economic and social value is eroded by barbarism and a lack of coherent economic ambition. A trial would have been impossible for practical reasons (arresting him?) and it would be impossible to make a trial meaningful for those who support the ISIS cause. Justice has to be if nothing else a reminded to all that the values of civilization have been breached and the process of justice and the sanction are an example of right being re-established or restored in the face of whatever was wrong; dishonesty, violence or evil.\nIn the case of Jihadi John and the criminals of ISIS they do not see western justice as re-establishing the values of civilisation but the exercising of infidel justice on the virtuous warriors of Islamic State. On that basis it is naive to think that any good can come of our imposing our justice, however benign, on them. They do not value what we value and have set themselves against the culture of the west and elsewhere; cultures that are to varying degrees more likely to respect the individual and believe we should work peacefully together to grow together through co-operation greater social and economic value……things of which they have declared a violent hatred.\nGiven this perspective it is right to ask why in the west perspectives are so conflicted about the right response to Jihadi John; a humane if naïve judicial response or a gloating aggressive one; typical of reductive polarisation. We at Blue Revolution believe that it is because the west does not have a clear and coherent view of what the basis should be for western justice in the 21st century. After all the west is a bit of a moral shambles itself as we never tire of pointing out, greed, arrogance and stupidity on an industrial scale create major social problems in the west. Our Blue Revolution is our preferred response to this calamity but the fact there is a moral calamity means getting a moral perspective is quite hard.\nHowever there may be a way forward; we don’t think many would disagree with us that the aim of any civilized community (at any point in history) including in the west (with the exception the major lapse of moral judgement in the Bush/Blair years) is to preserve value, be it social or economic in nature. ISIS put themselves outside the culture of any legitimate nation or state because it does not believe in preserving the legacy of the past for the benefit of the future. It destroys the past and the value that belongs from the past so it can’t be used to help society evolve socially, culturally or economically. Therefore they do not deserve to have any more than the minimum amount of scarce human and economic and social value deployed to remove their crazy life limiting and soul destroying ideology….the fewer of us who are harmed or the least time wasted in that process the better. ISIS are sad, mad and bad and they need to be eroded but let us not bray about it…let us just quietly get on with it; it is a bit like having to put down a violent dog.\n17.11.15 Terrorism in France – “something must be done”\nHave you ever driven the wrong way down a motorway? No neither have we; however, we imagine it would be very scary once you had worked out what was going on. The rhetorical question you might ask would be “oh shit something must be done” and “how can I deal with this FFS”. These are question’s the French specifically and the west generally are asking in the aftermath of the French terror attacks.\nThe Journey down the motorway would have started easily enough no cause for concern, nothing to worry about; I might have been 3am and the roads were clear at the start. However, as mile upon mile passed the slow realisation that something didn’t add up would have dawned and eventually you have traffic travelling towards you at 70 miles an hour to contend with. At which point there are two choices; panic or evaluate the threat properly. What you could not do is blame the road, or blame the other traffic, swerve around or brake hard. Neither could you carry on oblivious to the risk. This is a very self-inflicted problem.\nThe above feels to us like the situation Europe faces now it has woken up to the fact it has allowed it’s continent to become, in places at least, the nearest thing you can get to a caliphate. The European political elite, comfortable, multi lingual, and living off he labour of ordinary Europeans have from civilised subsidized citadels, allowed their “splendid isolation” to blind them the obvious fact that many who come here from North Africa do not share our values and are appalled by what we do with our freedoms. So faced with Paris what is the solution having finally worked out that we have been travelling the wrong way down the motorway for the last two decades or more?\nFirstly, we cannot jam on the brakes; we are travelling at 70 miles an hour. We cannot carry on either as we must deal with the threats from other traffic or eventually, we will have an accident. We need to think about how we safely turn around or pull over put the hazard light’s on to make ourselves and others safe and get out of the danger zone and not repeat the same stupid mistake again.\nOur Blue Revolution recognizes the march towards a common culture will happen over time and should be organic in character. So, in many respects driving the wrong way onto the slip road was an easy mistake for most western countries to make. The idea that cultural convergence would be a product of simple mass migration is an easy justification for mass immigration. What is there to worry about?\nHowever, the Blue Revolutionaries at Blue Revolution link cultural convergence to the production of the collective social and economic value within a modern context of freedom and equality based on contract, choice and consent. This is the bit that all western countries fail to recognise. Convergence is not simply about “celebrating diversity” or “being PC” as has been the belief since the mid 1990’s. It’s not about ghettoising migrants who have been “rescued” or “allowed to remain”. Cultural convergence is not about closing boarders to migrants either. We don’t want to speed up on the motor way or jam the brakes on. We must have a controlled and measured response.\nSo here the west there are all these countries, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden even the US and others all driving the wrong way down the motorway, it all looks ok for some time, no one had until recently seen the on-coming truck because the road was empty. However now we need to deal with the issue. But how?\nFirstly, that seven or eight deranged psychopaths can cause so much carnage is something to exercise the minds of western leaders and westerners in general. As is the level of fear that eight people generate. The evidence from Paris would suggest that there was an element of “making the targets up as they went along”. They had the guns, the bomb making capability and the hatred, but the targets were last minute. They hadn’t got tickets to the match! So, two blew themselves up quite safely! The idea of an ISIS mastermind is therefore unlikely. More a general position of “we hate the west, here are some bombs and guns go and destroy the infidel”. This is both a worry and a reassurance. More planning would leave a detectable trail. Organized with the sheer amateurishness of the planning here means they strike out of the blue.\nSo, the first thing we suggest is not to exaggerate the ability of any one to detect what is likely to happen. Agencies might foil plots, but they might not. To change a way of life beyond recognition probably isn’t worth it in the long term; a bit like a meat and alcohol-free diet you might live longer but it will be a hard life. The second point is that to police and to protect will impede the economy and although western economies produce too little value for the amount they spend. The west needs to continue to produce value both social and economic value and you can’t do this in a police state.\nThe second point is that we need to develop a shared “narrative” with people from all faiths and none and identify a way of linking with international partners which isn’t a rerun of the cold war but neither is clouded in denial about what those with whom we partner get up to behind their own boarders. This “narrative” cannot be the usual western fetish about “democracy” great though democracy is.\nAt Blue Revolution we link our blue revolution to three key elements; upon which democracy can be based but so can other ways of ordering society. We believe that Contract, Choice and Consent practiced between all adults is the defining benchmark of a civilised post enlightenment society; whether democracy or not. If countries allow relationships between adults to be governed by the 3 C’s then eventually democracy and freedom with begin to flourish.\nThe next point is that social and economic value is as much the victim of war as the lives of people killed. Therefore, the adventures of Blair and Bush destroyed too much social and economic value in Iraq for the aims they set themselves, namely “regime change”. On this basis going after IS needs to be proportionate to the long- term aim of preserving enough social and economic value to enable communities to heal. However, the destruction of IS, is essential as they are themselves destroying the very social and economic value they seek to conquer.\nFinally, the Blue Revolution is not just about the values of others; it is about the crazy behaviour in the west too; “secular westernism” as we call it. Any society which promotes or ignores the undesirable consequences of our seven deadly sins, is promoting secular westernism. It is not as dangerous as Islamism or fascism or Stalinist communism but is its own way it is equally as corrosive. Secular westernism undermines social value and compromises the ability to create and maintain economic value and gives the enemies of the western world plenty of things to hate us for…..and after Paris; hate us, too many seem to do, even if it is only a handful, it’s a handful too many.\n23.11.15 Secular Westernism- who are the Secular Westernists?\nThe last week and a half have been dominated by France and Belgium specifically and the threat from their friendly neighbourhood caliphates generally. The phrase Islamism and Islamist to describe those who advocate violence to others to further the ambitions of violent social and economic degeneration is becoming common place. We are also at last beginning to get a worldwide perspective on ISIS and their violent hostility to the universal goal of humanity which is bind people together by faith and culture, so they create the social and economic value necessary to enable them to survive.\nThe future of evolution is peoples of all faiths and cultures working to the same end. ISIS stand apart from this “law of nature” and destroy value and the capacity of mankind to create more value by their violence and a rigid social code that only works if your aspiration is to live in a cave and scratch out a living in the desert. Or you are an oil rich monarchy.\nHowever, whilst the west lacks the criminality, cruelty and violence of the Islamists, the Islamists may not be the only ones misunderstanding value and limiting mankind’s capacity to create more. The west has a more subtle approach to undermining the creation of value; it is hard to see and problematic to tackle as it has become the wests economic orthodoxy. It is what we call Secular Westernism something others have called the “western hegemony”.\nWe use the Blue Revolutionary term Secular Westernism as we believe that amongst every level of western society (elite to unskilled worker) there are the foot-soldiers of the Secular Western hegemony. It is as much personal as structural. Let’s call its advocates Secular Westernists. In contrast to the Islamist the Secular Westernist achieves undesirable outcomes by simply pursuing personal self-interest within a moral vacuum that lacks a faith based or Darwinian imperative to create the social and economic value necessary for society to evolve.\nWe talked about the seven deadly sins as the kind of behaviours which when practiced on an industrial scale have negative consequences on society as a whole; but we can add to the seven deadly sins the belief that wealth is a substitute for value, that the more wealth you have the more valuable you are and that wealth is “real” and is not a variable financial figure based on confidence or hubris overheating various markets.\nTo the Secular Westernist wealth being “real” is more important than human relationships or producing economic value. To a Secular Westernist wealth made by producing pornography is “real” wealth rather than simply money earned by producing something which has no objective value. Try and think of other examples; making money by selling personalised number plates for example or offering sex phone lines or even ‘shorting’ within the equities markets.\nAdd to this the fact that the various financial crises are evidence that when stock values collapse people loose wealth; there is no objective value there then and worryingly pensions depend on it.\nThis stuff is hard to understand but you need to think about how much of what a rich person has, is based on something real and how much is simply what they have borrowed or blagged or made by selling to the desperate, ill-informed or plain stupid, and is therefore the froth on the economy rather than the economy itself.\nThe challenge for the Secular Westernist and enlightened western governments as well as the Blue Revolutionary is to simultaneously see the “free market” as both the cause and the cure for Secular Westernism, and to see many of the great western general public as the foot-soldiers of the western hegemony; blindly promoting it, rather than being the “victims” of an evil system that only a governments of the red revolutionary type can overthrow.\nA British minister asked how many decades until a British worker works as hard as a Chinese worker, 10,20, 30 years. The answer is as long as it takes the western worker to understand that getting rich is no substitute for creating value either social or economic ……..and how long will that be? Perhaps we need to start by understanding more about value and desiring less personal wealth.\n24.11.15 You can take the Islamist out of the dust bowl, but you can’t take the dust bowl out of the Islamist\nYou can take the Islamist out of the dust bowl; but you can’t take the dust bowl out of the Islamist. This corruption of a British industrial working class saying has so much relevance for our understanding of the origins of Islamism. Indeed, it may help us to understand the passive support violent Islamists receive from the ordinary Muslim faithful and indeed perhaps the world’s Leninist left wing who offer sympathy to the economic underdogs of the world’s dustbowl economies. This Left wing believing the west is wholly to blame for North African poverty rather than seeing it as a combination of geography, greed, discrimination and corruption often with the overt connivance of the west.\nEssentially as we have argued before, too many nations that profess Islam as their nation’s faith adopt it as a ‘dust bowl religion’ in respect of its reaction to social and economic justice. It could all too easily occupy a place where making a living was (is) hard and precarious and where value (the product of economic and social activity) could be easily destroyed by war, crime and famine.\nThis sort of society would be coherent with Islam. In such an environment it would of necessity be hard and uncompromising; high expectations and harsh punishment for disobedience. The separation of social and economic roles would be applied, and women’s role would be crystalized as social as opposed to economic in character and subject to the guidance of men. This would meet the needs of society and its economy, but it would leave little scope to evolve.\nFirstly, such an economy would produce too little value and what value it did create was, as in all societies of the era except tribal ones, acquired by overlords. The faith was rigid economically excluding of women and hierarchical; but it worked and in dust bowls to this day still does. Blair and Bush’s folly was not understanding this when waging war in the middle east.\nWe would argue that when an Islamist comes to the west, they don’t see opportunity they probably see sinning on a grand scale. Their reaction is to reject “our way of life” and some; the most psychotic, take up arms to purify our culture of sinfulness. The fact that our freedoms create medicine, art, engineering and so on and so forth doesn’t occur to them, they are obsessed by the obscene freedoms the west has whilst looking enviously at the west’s wealth. Look around the middle east and you see absolutist kingdoms, wealth being held by monarchs and tyrants, you see a desire for hierarchy, authority and a somewhat hypocritical desire (amongst males) for purity. You don’t see values such as Contract, Choice and Consent which for us at a Blue Revolution HQ was the first rung on the ladder towards equality, freedom and democracy for all. And we still have some way to go.\nSo, whilst we have much to criticize the west about (too much superficial culture and wealth) it can’t be faulted for the commitment from all countries to Contract Choice and Consent. These three concepts need to be understood and promoted by all those who want to “fit” into the west. When someone from North Africa is able to demonstrate that they understand these three basic building blocks of freedom and can apply them in their day to day lives, they will clearly have taken the dust bowl out of their beliefs. Of how many Saudi princelings could one say that?",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_we-examine-the-four-markets-of-the-apocalypse-2/content_31.html": "We examine the “four markets of the apocalypse”!\nJust like the four horsemen of the Apocalypse bring war, famine, conquest and death so we believe that there are now four markets of the apocalypse that will signal the end of the West’s global preeminence and with that usher in an era of well, famine, war conquest and death! Many will argue that the “global system” has created wealth in abundance and staved off starvation and numerous other miseries. However, we have wars raging in the Middle East and in the west, the poor are getting poorer and being blamed for it. So we will explore our four markets of the apocalypse and how they contribute to the world’s misery and death. They are in order of significance, for us they are, the global labour market, Bond markets, The financial market, and the housing market.\nThe working classes have forever been victims of a failing system. From peasants locked into servitude then thrown into urban factories in the 18th and 19th centuries to the workers who, thrown into unemployment were salvaged from destitution by two world wars. More recently the stupifying horror of “healthcare and welfare” as capitalism gave way to the racketeering of the “free market”. What underpins all of these scenarios is labour market failure. However whilst the more obvious iterations of labour market failure are easy to see, we have sleepwalked through the most recent failure believing all is Ok.\nIt all began in the late 1970’s when capitalism finally got to the point where it was producing too little value to support the social and political institutions it had supported since the 18th century. Institutions like the law, politics and local government, health and welfare. Capitalism was on the ropes and whether by intention or accident the labour market was seen as a major cause of the failure. The solution was overseen by passive and ignorant political class who watched firstly the shift of higher value production to China and the re-emergence of the western economy as a “consumer” economy and finally the remaining “onshore” low-value work taken by migrants from Mexico or Eastern Europe. An economy that consumes but does not produce value isn’t an economy at all…unless it’s a kind of Alice in Wonderland economy.\nThe combined effects of this crazy business model has been to turn UK workers into welfare and healthcare “paupers” unwanted by the global labour market but growing fat and docile at the State’s or rather taxpayers expense. In the US the businessmen and women get rich whilst the poor are not pauperised but ghettoised and become that useful social commodity a criminal. In the UK many unemployed are hidden by a therapeutic language of “needs” and inadequacy taking them out of the labour market altogether.\nPeople, of course, do work but most private sector workers are in the “consumer” economy as shop, restaurant and hotel workers or the building industry. These workers rely on the other failing markets the housing, financial and Bond market to boost the economy in their sector, largely via debt.\nThe labour market has rendered British an US workers unemployable, created a docile underclass of ex-industrial and agricultural workers and their second and third generation offspring, whilst low production costs and “western” production values have made retail billionaires out of a whole unlovable bevvy of spivs and chancers. All this whilst the politicians have stood around in a kind of baffled paralysis and simply watched. In the US and the UK no one really “gets it” apart from the people getting rich from this crazy economic and social model. It makes publicly funded “chiefs” wealthy beyond their dreams, along with a whole swathe of what we call the publicsectoracy or the new taxpayer-funded elite. The workers currently have zombie jobs and low pay. Eventually with no jobs and no pay who knows what will happen.\nThe modern labour market has failed and is failing every time someone goes to work in the west and is paid with the proceeds of debt. When it finally crashes (because of the failure of our other markets) the crisis will render most westerners economically redundant with little economic or social value. This will usher in a feudal-like system run by the caring right and the psychotic left. Back to the future indeed.\nWhilst the labour market has failed in response to the latest iteration of the failure of western capitalism, governments or rather the State had to undertake business as usual and that meant paying themselves and their retinue wages initially set at the benchmark of what the capitalist or bourgeois system would tolerate. Now, however, shorn of the need to concern themselves with actual money taken from rich bourgeois taxpayers who had political clout the state borrows by issuing Bonds and defers the cost of running the State to the next generation. The baby boomers are really looking after themselves as only the 1960’s and 1970’s entitled generation know how to. Corbyn and a youthquake….get real! He is looking after the boomers first and foremost.\nThe problem with Bonds, like much else we call economics, is that they are debt and debt isn’t repaid or serviced by the state but by taxpayers and taxpayers who are in the long-term often not even born when the Bond is issued. Just as the working classes were sailed down the river by the politicians’ stewardship of the labour market the same is now going on with Bonds. A brief history of the Bond illustrates the point. Bonds were first issued in the 18th century to pay for military excursions and wars. In normal times the economy paid for the State but to prosecute war the State borrowed from the economy. Today the State buys breakfast with Bonds…..and that is good for no one and certainly not the working classes who, already on the road to pauperdom, will be paying for the State elite’s breakfasts for years to come. This market will fail, interest rates and inflation will once normal economics returns turn British and US Bonds into junk. The State won’t be able to borrow. How will the elite cope….? At the expense of the unemployed workers, of course. Ex-workers newly pauperised and docile, obsessed with identity and social media the new elite will simply take control. “fake news” is part of that process, it makes people trust their elite and not trust themselves.\nThe financial market is interesting. Back in the days of proper (albeit conflicted and exploitative) capitalism, the financial markets served the capitalist economy…Bankers were to coin a phrase petit bourgeois. The bankers served the interests of “capital”, capital owned by “capitalists”. The growth in the economy was driven by the profitability of the capitalist system, banking and the other bourgeois institutions like the law and parliament served the needs of the capitalist. However, we have explained that capitalism has failed having died sometime in the 1970’s and in its death throes it was unable to meet the demands of the State that had become bloated on it’s back. This was one of those threshold moments when international relations deteriorate, groups are blamed for the systems failure and wars start. Unfortunately, in spite of Bush and Blairs attempt to open up a lucrative war or two in the Middle East, war is seen as too costly, counterproductive and more significantly expensive. Bonds are no longer issued for paying for war but welfare, healthcare and wages.\nIn the absence of a real economy after the 1980’s creating value from the combining of factors of production (Land, Labour and Capital) and with capitalism dead in the western waters and wars and reconstruction no longer an option there was an ideological hiatus. What was going to happen?….well what happened is what is happening now!\nThe financial sector….for to hundred years the Aunt Sally of the real capitalist system became the “economic system”, in the newly minted and newly branded free market. With the opportunity to offshore work to places like China and bring migrants in to do low-value jobs at home, low production costs and high production values created huge profits for the racketeers, whilst the drive towards home ownership shifted public value into the hands of the private individual who could then borrow secured loans as their asset, their home, rose in value. This was driven by more borrowing, migration, artificial demand from broken homes and students.\nThe financial sector has essentially “equity released” Great Britain to indebted Britons or wealthy global speculators. Whilst the banking system has many tentacles, for us the most lucrative is the property backed lending spree that has kept the low-cost high-profit free market going. The whole thing is fine until the asset values plunge and consumption or spending power shrinks. This will happen, it happened in 2007/8 and nothing has changed except governments are now even more indebted and technically bankrupt than they were after 2007/8.\nThe final market which as we have hinted at above feeds the financial market with “value” is the housing market. This market is unreconstructed and depends on the levels of supply being outstripped by levels of demand. Levels of demand are manipulated by a number of factors including selling the homeownership ideal but at a more practical level migration, divorce and family reconstruction, as well as student rentals all, add to demand. This demand inflates prices whilst builders “Feed in” just enough property so as to ensure gentle inflation in the market creating “lending and borrowing opportunities” for the financial sector. This model of housing ignores some obvious flaws namely that housing should serve the needs of the economy, it can’t be a major part of the economy by providing the “value” base for secured lending.\nModern housing does not reflect the needs of the modern worker, it is based on the 1950’s mythical nuclear family. A home that has two or three bedrooms and costs £200,000 is not achievable nor for many modern workers desirable. The modern worker should be global, childless until a child is affordable, flexible and have accommodation which does not soak up a huge amount of earnings.The modern housing market is a Baby Boomer confection that is manipulated and engineered to produce monetary value to support the “free market”, the building industry and its CEO’s and the government.\nTo keep this important market going we need to inflate property prices, build on greenfield sites break up families and keep students and migrants driving people out of the town and city centres to the new out of town estates. This market will collapse and will take the financial market with it.\nThe four markets of the apocalypse are either failed but “zombied” like the labour or Bond markets or they are the great hope of the system but overvalued and indebted with high asset values feeding the consumer based economy. Looking at all four markets it is difficult to work out what to do. It’s like being in quicksand. don’t move or do move…..you are still going to drown!",

Are these issues linked?\nWe generally discuss the policies promoted within the western world in economic terms. But of course, there are very serious social consequences to these economic policies. The western world needs to ensure aggregate demand is maintained to ensure economic “growth” can manage the debt and pension liabilities it’s ageing population, ill and welfare dependent, require. In total, there are Billions of pounds worth of social liabilities associated with hundreds of thousands of people.\nIn the absence of a developed economy creating real economic value, rather than relying on debt as the Uk has been for the last forty years, the long term prognosis looks very dire indeed. The whole situation is made worse by the fact that no western economy is likely to start turning out real value unless it is re-engineered along with and the markets which service it. These markets include the welfare, education and labour markets. All these markets are expensive to run being largely functions of and therefore paid for by the State on behalf of the public. Carry on the way we are going and the country (not just the State) will be bankrupt in about fifteen years time.\nSo how do these markets affect the two issues above? In the modern economy with progressive legislation, the need for the government to manipulate certain “desirable” social outcomes shouldn’t really be necessary. Indeed the government should be on the look out for any contra-indications i.e. things that might be going wrong. Typically the world of work should allow people to choose what they want to do rather than having the State manipulating them into doing what the State thinks they should be doing. In this respect, there have been a number of shifts towards policies which on the face of it look progressive but in fact have discouraged responsible and economically sane behaviours.\nThe Tax credit has affected the labour market driving part time workers into the workforce whilst the cost of supporting their family in borne by the State. The knock on effect is that there is an increase in under-employed workers, working twenty hours, whilst the social needs of the community are met by the State and its health and welfare sectors. The part-time workers would be better employed working in their communities and families as happened in the past; looking after mum and dad and the kids rather than doing shelf stacking at a supermarket. A shift towards remaining in the home could be met with howls from the feminist lobby, however, rights are not embedded in society if the state has to pay top dollar to maintain them. This is particularly relevant when it is national debt paying for all of it. Of course, it contradicts current “progressive” left thinking. The “progressive” left see welfare as in important part of the British economy which just underscores how delusional they all are. Welfare is necessary but please it really can’t be seen as part of the “real economy” whatever that is, if it is funded from national debt.\nSimilarly, young people may be in education until eighteen but whilst this does suggest they may be deferring parenthood for a couple of years, it increases expectations and renders them unwilling to undertake menial work. This is the mischief that “free movement of people” is intended to solve. It is a government-engineered and tax payer funded problem which costs the government and therefore taxpayer money to solve. Nice work!. The minimum wage was introduced as a means of ensuring that migration didn’t destroy wage levels. Perversely with no migration and no minimum wage, wages would go up the only pressure bearing down would be young people entering the workforce.\nFinally in respect of the single mums. A single mum struggling to bring kids up alone is not giving their child the best “first three years”. Additionally detached from older relatives they all too often contribute too little to their child and community. Children and particularly infants need a lot of time and parenthood is demanding. We know one of us was a single dad. Again welfare engineers the “single mum” taking women out of the workforce full time but supporting them to struggle on their own or in part-time work with too little time to help those in the community who may need their help.\nToday there is no need to gender any of the above. A single mum could just as well be a single dad. The person at home could be male or female. Th point is and using the widest definition of social need (kids to the elderly) social care is not a just a government problem……it is a social one also!\n06.12.16 How safe is the world for people who are ordinary, powerless and or poor? V2\nFor the table top revolutionaries here at a Blue Revolution the big question is how safe are we in a world where the west is morally and financially bankrupt and the bits that work or seem to work are at the top of the social pile. The higher up the social ladder you are the more stable your life and the greater are the opportunities you can provide for your children. If you are at the bottom of the pile you probably have a life which whilst not at all identical in the type of uncertainty you would have experienced in the past, none the less you have fear and uncertainty to deal with often on a daily basis.\nFear and uncertainty for those at the bottom who burdened by debt, are benefitting those at the top, many of whom are the State its officers and officials, present and retired. The State has become a self-regarding and self-perpetuating behemoth. It seems to us that the State claims to speak in the name of the people, but serves its own ends and interests using the people as its justification. Welfare, health and Justice being examples but it could include the military too.\nThe left wing liberal State wails about a lack of social mobility and the widening wealth gap, but look below the surface and we can see that the State pays its top people or allows publicly funded top people to be paid indirectly from general taxation, multiples of what the British Prime Minister is paid. Please Don’t even get us started on the differentials between them and us.\nThose who benefit financially like all too many left leaning liberals, send their children to schools which confer privilege, whilst bemoaning a lack of opportunity for the poor. The working and lower middle classes need stable families (no uncertainty “gamed” by excessive welfare) and Grammar schools to assist them to enter the upper reaches of the establishment. From there they will start to dismantle the interests of the liberal elite starting with excessive wages at the top. No wonder the liberal elite does not want to support the ambitions of the blue collar workers.\nSo to answer the question above let us address the issue of how safe we ordinary people are with a liberal elite running our State on their own behalf. Well obviously not very safe, from our vantage point at least. They have spent the last fifty years looking after themselves at our expense. The EU question is more about them than us, and whilst they may have brainwashed a lot of under 25’s we grey-beards can see that the EU is their project not ours. And so is so much more besides.\nWe don’t think that the liberal elite is out to get us, us being right wing working people. Far from it, they are not out to get us or do anything other than maintaining a status quo which works for them and is funded by us. Hence their pathetic “Remain” campaign in the UK. However, this “doing very little” lets the more energetic, aggressive and ideological, drive an agenda even a subversive agenda, which could be very much against our long-term interests. These people and this agenda could be Islamist or fascist. If you don’t accept this analysis from where did ISIS suddenly arrive. They were not beamed down from space! Someone knew and no one really cared.\nThe world is basically feudal with Saudi Arabia at one end, a fully formed feudal system which Henry the VIII would have recognised, China in the middle and the serially feudal democratic “western hegemonies” at the other end. Why do we think our society is feudal even the US? Because we just elect a handful of people to rule us every now and again. As Germany found in 1933 the election bit can be set aside, now and again, as required by any crisis that the economy throws up.\nThe western liberal elite has no moral guts or gumption, they flip flop around their precious “Diversity” agenda as a proxy for doing something about the sexism and racism and homophobia inherent in religions that have not been cleansed of their prejudicial nonsense by capitalism. They think that as they, the liberal elite, currently hold power and see themselves as “progressive”, we are all Ok, long term. Of course, this is partly because they have lined their kids up (Blairs, Kinnocks, and all the others) to take over our from them so our interests must be safe!!!\nOur interests are not safe, can’t be safe with these people. The State is an almost exclusive club and is run by one basically liberal elite class. This class can be easily replaced if the wrong type of revolution takes place. A thick, lazy, underclass and a disengaged working class engineered by the elite to be docile, will put up no resistance when the atavism of other ideologies starts to bang on the door of our pathetic liberal elite. At that point the rights we enjoy (women’s, gay, trans, children’s, religious etc) and they pretend to protect will go, and a modern techno brutality will replace western liberalism. It is the working and lower middle classes which will suffer. The liberal elite will simply look at us, see us as too much trouble and begin to dismantle “our” State in the name of their new best friends and their State: whoever they are. And dismantle us with it.\nOh and just for good measure, we at a Blue Revolution don’t think the Trump-Putin alliance is a problem. Fear of it is just another example of the lack of moral guts which has become the hallmark of the “liberal elite”. Trump might be odd but he is unlikely to patronise the poor….he might cut welfare or something but may, as a result, energise the poor to use their skills to bring the US economy back to life. We have a lot more in common with the Russians and Chinese but it is Saudi Arabia which is our ally and we have nothing in common with them! Go figure!\nThe real enemy is the liberal elite our own enemy within.\n15.12.16 The West’s attitude to Assad and Russia’s success in Syria reflects the fag end of America’s dick waggling imperialism. With Trump, America might lead a coalition of cooperation and trade. America can then put its dick away!!\nNice way of summing up seventy years of American international policy! However ever since the 1940’s we have been forced to conclude that Russia was our sworn enemy and as a result, we have wasted between all western nations trillions of dollars “defending” ourselves from this largely illusory bogeyman. As with the EU trade would have been a better method of bringing a long-term peace than MAD…..for those too young to know, this stood for mutually assured destruction. In other words, if you kill me with your big dick I’ll kill you with mine!\nHaving hinted we are unilateralists it is necessary to clarify that we are not. We do not see Russia or China as an existential threat, they are in fact no more delinquent than we are but are delinquent in different ways (theft of intellectual property, doping athletes, limits to freedom of speech). Trade will bring us together (as independent nations) better than treaties and agreements unless they are a trade agreement. We need to maintain a nuclear deterrent because whilst Russia and China won’t nuke us there are plenty of nuclear powers and pretenders to the nuclear thrones who would love to blast the west and themselves into eternity.\n19.12.16 In the 1950’s and 1960’s the grammar schooled working class were an executive in waiting. That’s why the elite have engineered our indebtedness or our sad dependence on them as an underclass. A Blue Revolution is needed.\nNice way of summing up seventy years of American international policy! However ever since the 1940’s we have been forced to conclude that Russia was our sworn enemy and as a result, we have wasted between all western nations trillions of dollars “defending” ourselves from this largely illusory bogeyman.

We need to maintain a nuclear deterrent because whilst Russia and China won’t nuke us there are plenty of nuclear powers and pretenders to the nuclear thrones who would love to blast the west and themselves into eternity.\nLet’s us be honest the aristocracy has no power today and that is absolutely right. The aristocracy was stripping value from the peasants for centuries until first the merchants and then the techno merchants of the industrial revolution slowly undermined their power and wealth until with the democracy of the consumer economy we finally saw off the last vestiges of their power. We left their wealth intact. We don’t begrudge them their wealth; it was legitimately appropriated by the standards of the day.\nthe capitalists drove an unusual agenda promoting able people regardless of rank. But this was also the era of clogs to clogs capitalism, where grandad built up the business, the son maintained it and the grandson wasted the legacy. When left to natural ability alone they were in many cases incapable of transferring talent between the generations. Capitalism had failure built into it and quite right too. Life has failure built into it!\nWill Romeo Beckham have the talent to be an international footballer like his dad?……probably not! But no shame in that; that’s life. Will he benefit from his father’s wealth, probably yes. Is this fair…yes and no. Will the wealth last more than two generations…probably not.\nSo the aristocrats lost out to the capitalists the capitalists have however had the most ignominious loss as they have lost out to the state itself. Capitalism once value generating has gone and been replaced by the all-consuming State. A State funded by but not operated in the interests of the people. unlike the heydey of capitalism when the state needed capitalists money; when capitalists took control of the essentially feudal state and made it work for them, the state is now an entity set apart from the people, empowered by the weakness of capital and driven to expand its influence due to the public’s corrosive appetite for consumption. It, the “State” is returning to its feudal roots buoyed by its own self-importance.\nThe state is now using its power to protect itself and promote its self-interest via our public and private debt and taxation. The whole system works for a political and financial elite many of whom rely on the stupidity and debt of the general public to maintain their position. The cull on grammars ensures that no one is going to challenge this system. It came too close to it in the 1960’s so it ain’t going to happen again anytime soon. It is going to be as difficult to shift the publicsectocracy as it was to undermine the power of the aristocracy centuries ago. But it was done eventually by ordinary talented people; dissenters, merchants and capitalists and latterly traditional socialists who saw the harm unregulated power could do.\nWe can look at some examples of this beginning with criminal justice in the UK. The Criminal Justice System is a relic of the feudal past an unyielding system unable to give way to change. It has always reflected the values of the day, values promoted by the state, but in the face of progress has managed to retain its feudal appearance, wigs, gowns etc as the State it represented has morphed, matured and grown up with economic progress, it remained a farcical pantomime dame.\nThe law is expensive and serves the needs of the lawyers to an extent we believe is wholly at odds with the needs of the people. Take civil justice and the costs ratchet up into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The public win or loose, see lawyers getting fat on the debt and misery of the public. Should “justice” break the bank?…of course not. No society can function without an accessible Justice System. That is why in the West civil justice doesn’t really deliver affordable justice to the public and the maturity of civil society is correspondingly undermined. If Justice becomes expensive or under-funded then the lawyers move on and leave a moral vacuum to be filled by immoral legislation, just as they have done with divorce.\nYou can see where they go; they go to where the State will still fund them. Lawyer-legislators pave the way with lucrative earning opportunities such as Human Rights, but they will foray into other obscure stuff too stuff like misfeasance or misconduct. As long as the state lawyer cum legislators continue to make and then determine what laws are funded at the state’s expense, lawyers will get rich….rich and entitled to more.\nThe underclass provides a veritable swamp of criminal and immoral behaviour which also provides lucrative feeding opportunities for herds of lawyers. The public with their broken homes and imprisoned or drug addicted children watch as these parasites walk off with fortunes as the elderly rot in care homes or are abandoned and lonely. The breakdown of Civil Society might be bad for the masses but it is excellent news for the lawyers and an army of well remunerated senior managers in the “lucrative” State sector as well as leaders of “commissioned” services like social care for the elderly. A Blue Revolution would tip the balance back towards the people and away from our self-selecting masters by de-scaling their salaries, or simply making them redundant. Whlst it won’t be a bloody revolution it will be the slaughter of the excessive salary and the made up job!\n27.12.16 As we end 2016 we believe that in the last 18 months we have explored the roots of the west’s terminal moral and economic decline. We sign off 2016 and herald 2017 as the year of solutions.\nHappy new year to all our readers. We hope that a Blue Revolution 2016 has been both entertaining and challenging. Next year the really scary stuff starts. What exactly can you do to put the west back on its horse and once again start leading the world in a much needed moral renaissance?\nThe areas we will cover will include correcting the economic fundamentals of the misfiring western economy, the western education system, criminal justice and why it doesn’t work, democracy and the west’s democratic deficit, welfare, taxation, human rights and how we should both understand but not accept the causes of culturally defended abuses of basic human rights, and on what basis we\ncan construct a framework of rights which has a buy-in from around the globe….. oh and probably more on the EU (unfortunately!) But we will start 2017 with our analysis of “post-truth” politics.\n01.01.17 Post truth politics: the elite’s last desperate bit to undermine populism with their version of thought crime!\nWho would have thought that people who have been manipulating the public’s views on everything from who is our friend and who is our enemy all the way down to what we should think about moral issues such as abortion, debt or single parenthood should begin to undermine populism with the laughable claim that populism has all been the result of “post factual politics” or “post-truth” politics.\nThe sad reality of the situation is that “post-truth” politics has been going on since the end of World war II. It was initially underhand and was used to protect the interests of the predominantly American political and military hegemony. This included maintaining the idea that Russia was the world’s greatest bogey-man along with a number of other minor bogeymen, such as Castro or Saddam Hussain. Post-truth politics came out from the cold and went mainstream during the years of the Blair/Clinton/Bush administrations. Clintons claim not to have has sex with Monica Lewinsky and the Blair years with their “dodgy dossier” and countless other lapses and oversights which have landed the UK in the soup in Iraq and with the whole EU situation arose from an unwillingness, to be frank with the public.\nThe problem for the US UK and European elites is that populism is not caused by recent post-truth politics (dismal though it is) it is a direct result of the much earlier post-truth politicians telling the public stuff that the public either didn’t believe or came to recognise were exaggerations or lies. Blair and the Clintons are the master practitioners of these dark arts. They, not the Brexiteers or Donald Trump have created populism and we are grateful to them for their efforts. It is inevitable that the state would eventually overreach itself and have its legitimacy called into question resulting in its eventual diminution and final occupation by the people. However thanks to the hubris of Clinton and the Blairs the process may have been speeded up somewhat.\nThe response of the elite is to treat the public like thought criminals. What will be next, removal of our right to vote!\n03.01.17 The left wing elite “all sound and fury but signifying nothing”\nIf you have ever had the pleasure of being “caught out” by a left-wing liberal, particularly one who is in receipt of an income courtesy of the state, an MP, for example, you would be struck by the passion and fury or as we would argue faux moral outrage. It doesn’t matter whether it is a reference to the contradictions within feminism or promoting Brexit the outrage is often disproportionate to the value of the point being made. This disproportionate response reflects the lack of depth associated with the left’s argument.\nThe liberal left wing and like them those luvvies who have a conscience significantly smaller than their ego but who have been told by their agents or the liberal media about the value of believing in “fairness”, “justice” “equality” will always promote the left cause. They believe the left have a monopoly on universal human values! They promote the left’s causes because they feel that someone must do something but it won’t be them, they will use their “profile” to raise the issue so that the state can spend money sorting out the issue for them. This process has been referred to as virtue signalling.\nThe problem for the liberal left is that the people who actually try and solve the problem whatever it is, poverty, ignorance social failure are those who actually create it. The state itself. They try and solve it using massive amounts of taxpayers money but succeed only in promoting themselves and their cause at the expense of the taxpaying public and encouraging the slow relentless decline of collective moral behaviour.\nThere are two problems with the left-wing status quo and its continued existence under the Conservative government in the UK. One is that the people will never get the state off their back until they stop playing the state’s moral social and economic degeneration game, for example, running up personal debt as the west’s social values go into reverse. the second problem is that the whole of the state legal, political and economic elite perpetuates the problem. Just look at left wing lawyers. They present themselves as champions of the oppressed individual who is abused by the state, but they largely forget as they quaff expensive wine that it is the state that pays them from legal aid and this is drawn from taxation, levied on the debt-laden taxpayer.\nIt is like a perverse protection racket where human rights and anti-state “liberal left” lawyers, act on behalf of the individual to protect them from the racketeering state, but in doing so take money indirectly from those they are trying to protect, taxpayers; without realising or more likely not caring that they are simply adding to the people’s burden of exploitation. They are the conduit that turns the person wronged by the state against the people who have to pay for the case and all for their personal profit. John Bon Jovi, Springsteen, Eddie Izzard et al and the left establishment and the west’s elite lawyers all sound and fury signifying nothing.\n05.01.17 Without its Christian anchor western Capitalism has morphed into a free market of no value and manufactured wealth. We offer a global solution!\nThe world can’t undo capitalism even though some of the left would like to. The morality underpinning capitalism was Christianity. Protestant Christianity offered a code of behaviour based on personal moral restraint. Combined with the workings of labour and capital this moral restraint created value in unprecedented volumes which transformed the world.\nWith the exception of a few malcontents who fail to understand the social progress ushered in by the capitalist economic revolution, most agree that capitalism was not immoral. Unfair perhaps, but not immoral. On this latter point, even Karl Marx agreed.\nSocialism in Britain after World War two sought to correct capitalism’s unfairness and at the same time much more of the world opened up to the productive capacity unleashed by the capitalist model, (even when under the control of the command and control states of Russia and China).\nIt was this combination socialism at home and capitalism abroad which helped evolve the western capitalist model in the west, sheering off the self-restraint required by Christianity as competition became wide-ranging and expectations of western workers too high. Financial engineering was the west’s salvation delivering the now fetishised “free market”.\nThe experience of social and moral decline, combined with a free market which has no restraining forces (commodifying everything in effect) has delivered a world of debt and greed and unnatural extremes of wealth. The holy grail of “trickle down” economics will not happen largely because of the free market. Unlike capitalism, the free market is not a system based on moral relationships but on financial ones. A bit like the internet!!\nThe relationship between capitalist and worker was as much moral as economic. The capitalist employed the worker and paid him/her wages, both were interdependent. The whole system encouraged both respect and self-reliance for self and others. The political left wing in Europe has undermined this morality and replaced it with a morality based on state intervention and tax payers cash whilst financial engineering as delivered the final moral blow. This has left the western hegemony devoid of moral content.\nMuch of the world has never enjoyed the moral relationship enjoyed by Christian capitalism. This is reflected in too many parts of the world in relationships between people who have no power to challenge their modern feudal overlords. There has never been a capitalist revolution in these countries many oppressive regimes of which are propped up with wealth from natural resources like oil. No need to garner the respect of a working class there. Just keep whatever passes as a working class in their place.\nThe problem with the western hegemony is, however, most starkly seen in the appalling state of relationships between the sexes. In many respects, the “free market” is taking relationships between the sexes back to a pre-capitalist age where men were able to assume an uncontracted dominion over women and as a result, the state now has to intervene to protect some woman from men. Domestic abuse, sexual violence, pornography and child abuse are all phenomenon that, whilst they have always been present, are now becoming a western epidemic. Of course, this abuse goes on in Somalia, Niger, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia etc, but as we have suggested these countries have never had a culture based on Contract, Choice and Consent; the west’s Christian and Capitalist foundations.\nSo with Christianity now weakened to the point of irrelevance in the west, cultures with no tradition of Christianity or Capitalism are becoming pre-eminent and Christian values in he west are giving way pre-capitalist relations This is happening between the sexes, classes, races and nationalities even in the west (relations based on compulsion, coercion and control underpinned by suspicion). The world has a major problem. What could possibly be the answer?\nTo try and answer this we need to look at what we can learn from the evolution of humanity. Firstly every epoch leaves a trail of characteristics some good and some not so good. We need to look at what capitalism has left behind now it is on its way to long-term oblivion leaving the vestiges of some good things which are obscured by the smoke and mirrors of the corrupted free market (the free market is not bad, just the western corrupted one based on government spending and financial engineering)\nThe story of humankind journey begins at the point at which we ceased to be mere beasts of the field. When we evolved a “species-essence” distinct from the animals. The characteristics of man’s “species-essence” is to consciously cooperate to ensure the species survival. The positive characteristic of this era was that most enjoyed the spoils of the cooperative effort equally. There was little in the way of hierarchy or selfishness. The negative side was that with rare exceptions there was a yawning gulf between the status of men and women. The origins of objectification were born during this phase of mankind’s existence, the original, original sin was born! And so it survives today as objectification in a very much weakened but none the less corrosive form in the west.\nThe feudal system created hierarchy and conferred power by rank. This is against mankind’s species-essence which is essentially cooperative. Capitalism moved the rank structure from a model based on birthright to one based on the acquisition of production value and the exploitation of those who created the value, the workers.\nHowever notwithstanding exploitation capitalism’s positive legacy was to free people from feudal bondage. With capitalism’s Christian underpinnings, rights to contract, make free choices and consent to an action involving them, people gained theoretical if not actual, useable rights. This process of contract choice and consent has driven mankind forward, increasing productive capacity and providing a light touch moral framework that all participants accepted as the best means of progressing and ordering society. The problem is that socialism in the hands of the state has been forced to correct capitalism’s less desirable side effects….essentially the class system and the exploitation of workers. Because capitalism was incapable of doing it for itself the state has taken a sledgehammer to crack a walnut!\nNow however the work of the state is largely done in the UK and Europe (not so the US) and so we could see a revival of social relations based on the concepts of contract choice and consent with the corresponding uplift in moral behaviour.The state can then begin to shed some of the responsibilities it has acquired but can no longer afford and can start to hand powers to a population now far less exploited and more willing and able to play its part within the body of the state itself.\nIf we look elsewhere in the world, we can see that there are still too many places that have a society based on tribal culture the most notable and “advanced” being Saudi Arabia, and others which are essentially feudal, Syria and North Africa being examples. We can look at the world and see what stage of humanity any culture is essentially defined by and therefore how divisive or exploitative it is.\nWe can and should also wonder about a future with capitalism running out of steam and Christianity in a weakened condition. What can be done to progress the world and her cultures towards a more enlighted place? Creating a progressive and hopefully in time just and cooperative global identity, a reflection of mankind’s universal species essence.\nThe answer to all of us at a Blue Revolution is to get the world and her people to accept that whatever one might think about Capitalism past, and where it still holds sway, present, the legacy of contract, choice and consent has helped liberate people from tyranny and abuse.\nThe western world weakened and indebted should champion the rights of all peoples in the world by demanding that every adult of whatever race or gender should be accorded the right to contract, choose and consent and that any culture that denies these rights is somehow failing to respect people’s species essence and is, therefore, to various degrees discriminatory, oppressive, cruel or barbaric. We should shame both our friends and our enemies and use the legacy of capitalism to champion the rights of women, children, the poor and dispossessed and set them on the path to freedom and democracy.\n09.01.17 How close to achieving her goal of making Britain work for everyone is Theresa May? We apply a Blue Revolutionary rinse to her proposals! V2\nThis post was going to be about generation “snowflake” and what might have caused many of the youth of today to be so weak, over-sensitive and passive aggressive. It was going to explore the origins of this phenomenon and arrive at an explanation for it. However in the UK Theresa May has given a speech which covers the same turf, albeit from a slightly different angle.\nWe believe that generation “snowflake” is the product of Blairism and what might now be called the generation “state” namely their parents. Blair, Brown, Starmer and the other theologians of the British “third way” created a self-defined benign form of intervention which consolidated the power of the state at the sharp end of social and economic engineering. There remain many losers some in their 50’s but many more did very well too. This generation “state” is the younger generation of the post-war “baby boomers” the under 60’s, those who voted for Blair and have benefitted from “Blairism”, the debt, welfare and public sector expansion of the naughties.\nAs a result of Blairism, a class of parents was created who became reliant on a combination of “third-way” debt based state generosity, and who learnt to absorb high levels of personal debt. In exchange for this “affluence”, these people had to suck up identity politics and accept a loose moral culture which encouraged adolescence well into middle age. A generation “state” was created for whom personal responsibility was undermined by a so-called benign state. This “benign” system has forged an even more damaged generation, the psychologically broken snowflakes. It has also led to the elderly; the older baby boomers (and older still) being abandoned on an industrial scale by a now almost broke state funded care system. And still the left wing, the vulnerable and the delusional call out to the state for help. To them we say….”don’t you get it”. “The state can’t help, the best it can do is spend more money and still things will only get worse”.\nPhysical and mental distress caused by Blairs “things can only get better” hubris. Where is his nemesis?!\nAs we have suggested the middle and working class parents of the Blair era had in addition to state subsidised multiple “reconstituted families”, debt-fuelled affluence which could be paid off from further debt rescheduling on the back of inflating house prices. Their offspring, living in this unstable and for them, an unachievable la-la land, became insecure and sometimes deeply disturbed and needy. As a result many lack the kind of personal resilience which makes for a strong and effective society and although “bright” they reject criticism and challenge so socially, economically and morally undermined do they feel. This cultural phenomenon has been transformed into no platforming and “safe spaces”. Undermining free speech one of the pillars of democracy.\nTheis parents, generation “state” are a complicated demographic and in many ways are a natural Blue Revolutionary constituency; Euro-sceptic, hard working, skilled. However unlike a normal Blue Revolution constituency collectively they have benefitted from inflated house prices and low-interest rates. Many have retired early with good public sector pensions and they can afford new cars and holidays.\nWhat causes the problem is that they have failed to contextualise their success and to understand the differential reality their “snowflake” offspring have experienced since their birth in early to mid-1990’s. This failure of generation “state” to understand the basis of their good fortune alienates one generation from another. The two most significant and active political generations, young adults and their parents don’t “get” each other! The people Mrs May needs to appeal to are in reality are the young adults, they are the “JAM’s” they have lost out to their parents big time. they are the ones for whom she spoke about “seeing other people getting on ……etc”.\nThe generation “state” demographic have enjoyed a series of governments who have engineered their continued financial success, but at a massive cost to their socially and economically vulnerable offspring. Whether it is Quantitative Easing, the financial deficit, housing policy (inflating private housing and not building public housing), low-interest rates, abolishing retirement ages, creating student loans, zero hours contracts, abolishing vocational training in the 1990’s or maintaining top public sector salaries, it is all conspiring to ensure that the new young adults (some now working parents) feel that they are failures in contrast to their “successful” parents. The young voted remain because they believed the EU bureaucracy was there to help them. Unlike the “Tories and Westminster” who seem to them only to represent the interests of their parents.\nThe confusion as seen by us at a Blue Revolution is that it was Blair’s generation “State” who were forced to suck up “third-way” and EU lunacy such as diversity and identity politics, free movement of people, political convergence in Europe etc as the compromise they had to make for the Blair state’s largess. However, it is they who twenty years later, flush with full-time jobs, housing and pensions, divorce and adultery, have abandoned this socially engineered economic lunacy (hence Brexit). These largely well-heeled parents have given a thumb down to the over-engineered and ultimately flawed Euro and third-way solutions to the UK’s domestic social and economic issues. But not until after they have done, and continue to do, quite well from them!\nPerversely it is the young who continue to believe that they would have benefitted from remaining in the EU. They have also swallowed the whole free movement, political convergence, “identity politics” mumbo jumbo, hook line and sinker. Perhaps it’s a case of “if you say something often enough eventually people believe it”; particularly if you start saying it when they are children.\nSadly for us, we believe they have got the issues the wrong way around. They should, like their parents, accept and support Brexit but hold their parent’s generation to account for the lamentable state of their lives as well as the poor state of the real economy, housing and the job’s market. Inter-generational generosity and understanding and support is needed. A kind of truth and reconciliation between the generations!\nThe mental health crisis Mrs May is determined to tackle is a product of all that has gone wrong in the lives of the “snowflakes” over the last twenty years or so, mostly thanks to Blair and his naive “third way”; all that has gone wrong in the British economy and gone wrong in the EU……But sadly it’s going to take the next generation (the current 5-10 year-olds and a Blue Revolution to boot) to put it right.\n11.01.17 Anatomy of the economically engineered elite; or how people get stinking rich and how should a Blue Revolutionary react.\nWe all know how the bankers get rich, flogging “financial products” to people who all too often can’t afford them or don’t need them. The governments collude by manufacturing a housing crisis driving up private house building on the back of engineered social and moral decline (divorce and family breakdown) and “free movement of people”. We have explored the links between growth and housing in a previous blog so won’t go over it again here. However, a new house needs filling with stuff and this stuff is too often bought on credit so the bankers win this way too. The stuff that oils the wheels of this modern commerce is “confidence”. An economy based on confidence and debt certainly makes the planet sweat….as well as those of us unlucky enough to understand how it works only after it has broken us.\nAnother way the bankers and their hangers-on get rich is by the western world’s Quantitative Easing. In this simple scenario, Britain becomes a haven for foreign and British cash swilling around the world looking for a home (otherwise called an investment) and the banker’s trouser more cash. Others benefit too, like artists who can flog for millions of pounds an empty bed and some dirty knickers calling it “art”.\nThe creation of wealth owned by an array of celebrities, luvvies, sports personalities and retailers needs to be understood too because along with bankers these people are earning far more than is good for them….and us. But how does this work? Then we can move onto our old friends the “publicsectocracy”.\nIn simple terms, the inflationary pressures that normally increase prices when money is available in abundance (it might not feel like it is but trust me there is a lot of money around) doesn’t work because global low wage levels and low-interest rates ensure that prices don’t get hiked due to higher production costs for the stuff we buy. In this world of money filtering into the system from government debt plus our own “confidence based borrowing” people like Sir Philip Green can sell us stuff that costs him a fraction of what you have paid him to buy it. This foreign manufacturing and low-interest profit bonus is then neatly engineered to avoid tax in the UK. We might as well tip our personal debt and taxpayer’s money straight into the pockets of the Sir Philip Greens of the world. We use him as an example but it isn’t difficult to identify other rich people who get super wealthy from these “Disneyland” economics.\nother stuff that is financially engineered (apart from tax, debt and borrowing) are house prices and stocks and shares this is because house price inflation maintains the public’s appetite for, and ability to secure debt, and stocks and shares form the basis of most pensions…..a very worrying reality indeed.\nThat covers retail millionaires. However they are not the only people who get super rich (by which we mean rich beyond their actual economic or even moral worth), the next category and we do love these people because they are special….. are the celebrities, actors, TV presenters and sports stars. Their road to fame and for us more significantly, wealth is a different route to that of the retail giants above. these people are wealthy because someone thinks “they are worth it”. Ahhhh, love them!\nIn the old days and if you have watched the film “a bugs life” you will remember a wandering band of “entertainers”. This motley crowd of bugs and insects travelled from place to place entertaining communities. The life was precarious and the wages largely determined by the popularity of the group.\nThis description is similar to entertainers from the middle ages right through to the age of mass entertainment. You were worth what the public (or a patron) thought you were worth and that was reflected in how much they were prepared to pay to see you; buy your sheet music or gramophone record. I hope you would agree with us that there is a symmetry to this. The composer might get richer than the pianist in the local pub but it was a reflection of how many copies of sheet music they could sell that made them rich. Each purchase was a small part of a consumer’s income, but was affordable and added value to the consumer’s life through the pleasure of consuming the composer’s music.\nUnfortunately, there came a point when organisations like the BBC, ITV and now Amazon and others cease to be a mere conduit through which a “performer” offers their “talent” to a platform (Records, sheet music publishing, TV, RADIO, Internet) to entice people to buy, and became the mechanism via which the organisation tries to calculate a performers “popularity” and therefore their price. The organisation (the BBC or ITV, Fox, or Amazon) determines this price, a price the consumer has to pay for a Performer whether they like them or not. The consumer no longer really has an active role in the process.\nWe can hear voices crying out “but what is the alternative”. Well it isn’t going to be easy but one crude way would be for organisations like Broadcasters the FA and FIFA to set limits on wages and these must be realistic, accepted across “platforms” and whilst recognising talent these wages should not be so excessive that it penalises the consumer. In our “Bugs Life” example the consumer was king……not the performer!\nAn alternative might be to evolve some interactive functionality to enable popularity to be properly gauged so that performers are paid wages or fees based on their value to consumers as determined by the consumers themselves. The BBC could try this with BBC 3 for example. A sort of payment by results.\nIf you think about authors you get a better idea about what we are trying to achieve. An author writes a book. A publisher likes it and publishes it. This is like the BBC liking a performer and broadcasting them. However, the Publisher does not buy the book the public does and the wealth the author gets is directly linked to the number of books sold. We at a Blue Revolution have some people who have published….and no millionaires yet! With the broadcaster it is as though they say….”we will buy the books and make a disinterested readership pay because we can….they pay a licence fee”. So things need to change to make this economy in “talent” work for consumers and not just the “celebrities” they consume.\nFinally and possibly the most obscene of the stinking rich we come to our old enemy the “publicsectocracy”. These are the publicly funded and waged members of the public sector elite who have engineered their wages so far beyond what they are actually worth it’s almost a national embarrassment….not just a national disgrace. The newspapers occasionally refer to them and do a great naming and shaming exercise however nothing changes. The reason nothing changes is because the whole mechanism of government, state and the Public Sector works on the basis that wages equal talent. In government, state and the public sector, it is usually the opposite.\nThe slippery wage aspirational and entitled public sector “Chief” finds a safe and uncritical haven in the public sector. They can talk themselves and their “peers” up so that it becomes an established fact that to get the right person (like them) a particularly high wage must be paid. Often, however, they simply recycle themselves getting paid more and more as they incompetently perform in their job but competently climb the greasy pole of top public sector remuneration.\nSome organisations with the biggest budgets and their hands on the nations “balls” tend to rip the public off more than others. So in our rough rank order of theft by their “top people” from the working class tax payer we have ; the NHS, the Universities, “School Academy heads”, The Judiciary and QC’s, the Mandarin Civil Servants, the military and finally the chief execs of everything from local authorities to Housing Associations and Charities.\nTo put this right is relatively easy….the Government on behalf of the general public abandons bogus performance targets (the means by which these crooks get away with it) and freezes their wages. In addition, retire the many redundant people at the top and don’t replace them, and finally when posts become vacant offer a wage no higher than that of the Prime Minister. There will be takers, probably those who genuinely care about the organisation for whom they work and more importantly care about the people they serve and not the wages they get paid.\nOh and finally whilst not in the league of the super rich or the Publicsectorcrats, the Trades Unions Barons need a special mention. The workers should demand that they should loose their wages in line with the wages lost by striking workers, and there should be a ballot on how much they are paid.\nJeremy Corbyn’s jumped on this bandwagon recently with his typical student activist response to this problem. His solution is to cap wages and we presume he means private sector wages too. Apart from the public sector and his own wages as an MP which should be capped, this is Socialism at it’s worst. The private sector market in wages needs to be re-engineered so that the consumer has a far more accurate and active role in determining the level of wages for those they consume as performers and the rest of the wages market (finance, business etc) needs to subject itself to reform too. However, not at the point of wages and remuneration being fixed by the government but at the point where the consumer or the worker gets respectively either locked out of their role in the market or are exploited by their bosses. That fat bloke from Sports Direct springs to mind with this latter point.\n19.01.17 Bankers! Good or Bad?\nFrom the money lenders of Biblical times to the bankers of the Capitalist era Bankers have excited different emotions. The Jewish money lenders of the middle ages were persecuted when the feudal overlords, stricken just like the EU with a sclerotic economy failed to repay their debts and were, along with their families murdered, often horribly.\nTalking to radicals and “revolutionaries” on the left and right it is their lazy assumption that there is a Jewish conspiracy undermining the world and operating through the banking sector, controlled by powerful Jewish families. Being Blue revolutionaries we take the more sensible view that the bankers are like politicians driven by the desire to make money and the “system” has been engineered to deliver a now largely valueless profit. Not engineered by Jews but by politicians.\nIt is not a Jewish conspiracy but a banker/political collusion to deliver what both believe to be a ” positive social and economic good” otherwise known to politicians of a gullible stripe as economic “growth” and to the bankers, profit which translates into personal bonuses.\nWe as consumers, along with the politicians who liberalise the system, buy into the Alice in Wonderland guff. But let us be honest if you are a short-lived political gadfly, desperate to look competent and a banker tells you that they can magic up growth you are likely to be persuaded. This “growth” is preferential to even a short-term period of “economic stagnation” even if eventually “real growth started to re-establish itself. We only have to look at how the doom mongers would prefer decline post-Brexit. Economic decline is the post-Brexit narrative of choice for the elite, such is the power of stagnation or decline to manipulate opinion. However, as we have said before this banking manufactured “growth” is simply debt sometimes backed by property often backed by “consumer confidence”. The money going into the economy props up a service sector that needs money from any source to provide the jobs and the profitability the economy and the politicians need. Conspiracy no, bankers bad…..well no. Collusion …..well yes bankers good…..err no.\nBankers are simply the dung beetles of the modern free market, rolling up debt to make a profit. When we had real capitalism (and that era also had its problems) the banker incentivised effort and efficiency and thus drove economic activity and productivity. Rather than speculating and creating a kind of Oz-like “growth”, it would be better for people to borrow to invest in an actual productive activity otherwise known as “hard work” and for banks to only lend to those who wanted to drive growth by their hard work. Until the banking “emperor” is shown to have no clothes we will all go on borrowing and spending, the more extreme of us convincing ourselves that it really is all the fault of bankers and Jews and has nothing to do with us.\n20.01.17 The “Blue Revolution’s” analysis of that “great” Trump Speech!\nWe have a number of our own narcissists who, like all narcissists, want to be proven right. So we have unleashed the collective power of the Blue Revolution to both analyse the Trump Speech and to predict his likely success. The reason? So we can sit back in a year’s time and say, at least to anyone reading this, that “we told you so”.\nFirstly a declaration of interest; we supported Trump prior to the election and like Brexit felt that the alternative was too dire to contemplate. The prospect of an administration headed up by a Clinton with their politics of identity, politically correct waffle, and alienating class-based politics was taking the West nowhere good. Post Truth politics is the stock in trade of this group. They have prioritised their wealth and that of their class at any cost, to the detriment of millions of Americans. Now we have heard Trump’s 16-minute speech, which was basically a response to the hegemonic culture of the elite, what do we think?\nTrump sounds a bit light Blue RevolutionrY as he speaks with a transparent language heavy with meaning and lacking any flourish or nuance. He speaks to the constituency who have, as adults, been fired from “rust belt” industries as work went to China and who have seen their children promised education as a means of entering the establishment, whilst the elite close ranks to keep them out. Even in the U.S. a class culture excludes those who lack the …..well whatever it is!\nWhy the working class youth riot against Trump is not clear, perhaps they think that the Democratic party and its love in with bankers, millionaire business, political administrators, and their supposed liberal social policies will enhance their opportunities in life. In Marxian terms, they need their consciousness raising. The elite liberal state is undermining them, but unbeknown to them, they have been socially engineered to remain in a political stupor of liberal identity politics. The UK nearly became a cropper with this too in the Blair years. What worries us Blue Revolutionaries is that the rule of the liberal elite runs counter to the interests of the working classes. But too many of the working classes have been rendered incapable of recognising it, and can Trump do anything about it?\nWhat we heard when Trump was speaking was a man who has a simple business vision for an economy which has grown too complex as the world has impeded on it, through it and around it. We will come to economics later, however, some of Trumps promises will be in theory at least easier to deliver than others.\nShifting U.S. diplomacy away from the obsession with global intervention should be easy, but the Hawks in the GOP may not wish to see the corresponding reduction in military spending. Likewise, the idea of no longer demonising the Russians can only be positive but again the U.S. military machine has been geared up to operate on reductive polarities…since the end of WWII it has been a case of identifying the latest enemy, can Trump stop this pathological obsession.\nThe famous “wall” (“my wall, it’s a great wall, the best wall”) may possibly not happen either, the idea is a bit inflammatory and just like the hush-hush reality that the British economy has become over-dependent on migration (for all sorts of economic reasons), so it isn’t clear to us, to what extent the U.S. economy is the same. A wall may perversely be an adverse development for the U.S.\nFinally the pledge to effectively re-engineer the American working class using neo classical economics. This is a wholesale re-engineering of a class that has been forced into poverty and ignorance by decades of activity by the liberal elite. The unemployment, low wages, ignorance, loss of real Blue Collar work, the slide into divorce and debt has left a legacy of lawlessness and drug misuse that, as we have said previously, makes parts of western cities and particularly some U.S. cities look like microcosmic feudal fiefdoms. The reality for too many people is that these places are not safe spaces they are cruel depraved neighbourhoods where women and the vulnerable are abused and there are none of the freedoms associated with liberalism. The liberal elite has pulled out!\nWe believe this forgotten legacy of the liberal elite is too complicated for President Trump. Whilst he can talk about it, we can’t see how he can really do anything to change it. The causes are too complex to overturn in a generation whether it is the economy or society, and then there is the fact that his whole approach seems to be cast by him as Trump the billionaire patrician doing stuff for the poor. We at Blue Revolution take the view that the poor need to do stuff for themselves….and that includes getting into real politics. We can’t see Trump achieving that. Reclaim the streets with Trump’s assistance would be a better argument. As for the economics…well we take the view that any form of neo-classical economics unless deployed within a wealthy (not debt laden) closed economy achieves exactly the opposite of what Trump wants; it feeds the global markets and makes a hand-full of people very rich.\nSo in summary Trump offers an analysis of the consequences for America of the liberal elite’s sixty years in power. However, he goes little further than offering an analysis of the problems created by this power and its effects on America’s poor. He offers no actual programme of change. We didn’t hear any practical solutions. His analysis is also limited by the political, social and financial parameters associated with the hegemony he is so enthusiastic to criticise. For example, he says he will give power back to working class Americans….how exactly and did they ever have “power”! It took an eccentric using the language of Main Street to become president, but he is a billionaire!\nFinally Trump seems to us to have made an elemental business error; he has over promised and is almost certainly going to under-deliver. Perhaps being “Mr President” was his goal….not really sorting out America for the benefit of anyone but himself and his rich family. This would fit his psychological profile, at least according to some of us! We suspect that in four years time Trump will hear his own famous words delivered back to him by the American people…”You’re fired!\nDo we think the Blue Collar U.S. blue collar workers will be liberated by Trump? No, we don’t, but he is still a better bet than Clinton.\n21.01.17 The anxious foot soldiers of the illiberal elite take to the streets post Trump. What they really fear is a vision of a world post the Clinton’s V2\nThis as a brief post as we have been shocked by the riots in the U.S. and the demonstrations in Europe over Trump. The anxious footsoldiers of the illiberal elite clearly believe that Trump represents a shamelessly divisive and discriminatory perspective and will roll back decades of progress in respect of social integration and sexual equality. This is of course, as far as we are concerned, rubbish. The reason is that the U.S. is a democracy with a constitution that makes it impossible for Trump to deliver an agenda based on hatred or discrimination. He may send some reproductive rights back to the individual States but that is pretty much as far as he could go.\nWhat the foot soldiers of the illiberal elite are protesting about is that Clinton didn’t have an argument at the U.S. election and therefore lost. She and the elite demonstrated an absence of a so-called “liberal ideology” that takes America beyond the Clinton, Bush, Obama status quo. A status quo which has sucked up to amongst others the Saudi’s with their heroic record of women’s rights whilst turning on others no better but certainly no worse.\nThe foot soldiers of the elite don’t know who to blame for the mess America (and the EU)) is in. The wealth inequality, the celebrity culture, the banking crisis, social and moral decay etc. The foot soldiers can’t possibly blame themselves or the liberal elite who have helped them gain their individual personal identity and employed them in the government sector. All this whilst giving the blue collar workers the order of the boot as their jobs were exported abroad.\nSo they will blame Trump for…. well-being Trump, a seventy-year-old locker room jock with wandering hands, bad hair, cringeworthy chat up lines, and a self-important turn of phrase. In the overall scheme of things Trump probably comes in well ahead of Obama and Bush in the sexual preoccupation stakes……but well behind “old man” Clinton, the shaggers shagger.\nAs we posted yesterday Trump will, of course, be his own undoing. Which is sad. But it is unlikely to be a sexual impropriety that does for him.\n22.01.17 To understand “populism” where are the Anthropologists when you need them? Keeping schtum so as not to offend their academic masters. We step in to help\nWith all the wailing and gnashing of teeth going on around the world particularly among the “right on” classes and the elite we must ask the question; what exactly is “populism” and should we fear it or be inspired by it?\nIf we look at the rough history of populism it has overall been a force for good. Or so we think. If it hadn’t been for populism, we would probably never have shuffled any further than a few miles from the warmth of our fire and security of our cave. Populism back then would have been as seismic a shift as giving a driving licence and the full franchise to a Saudi woman today. Tribal society thrives on simple certainties.\nHowever, leaving the cave and fire via what was probably a popular uprising, whilst risky developed our brain and our capacity for more complex social and economic systems. And so it probably is with populism today.\nThe similarities between leaving the certainties of our past system don’t end with the “movement”, uprising or revolution, however. What comes next is critical as populism the “feeling” is probably more powerful that the “knowledge” about where we are going. In this respect, we believe Brexit has greater certainty than the Trump revolution. In America, people voted Trump as he presented himself as a beacon of positive change. However, no one really knows what the change is he proposes, except to make America great again whatever that means in a post-World War II globalised world.\nIn this sense, America has taken the same kind of “punt” that Germany took in 1933 or Russia in 1917. However, Trump is not a dictator nor could ever become one in the U.S. His election was, however, a lunge into a kind of uncertainty because the old ways were no longer working for the masses. The masses have left the fire and cave provided by the “liberal elite”; Hillary Clinton only managing to persuade those who ate at her table to remain faithful to her tribal cause. What is scary is that is over half the popular vote.\nSo populism can be very dangerous, very dangerous indeed as Russia and German in the early 20th century confirm; but in strong resilient democracies like Britain and the U.S., it is clearly time for populism to kick start the march to a better future, Even if with Trump that future is for the time being a bit unclear and sketched on the back of a fag packet.\n29.01.17 Do the baby boomers really “get” their responsibility for the current mess the young are in, and why don’t the young revolt.\nIf you are young and by young we mean under 30 you may ask yourself why the world is such a mess and why there is for you uncertainty at every social level, an uncertainty that exists irrespective of social class or wealth. We commented back in our early posts that uncertainty and contingency were the characteristics which defined mankind’s earliest iterations.\nSince the dawn of man, nervously blinking out of the pre-historic darkness trying to make sense of their consciousness and therefore their mortality, their fear and poverty, the human drive has been to improve their “lot”. The faith and cultures that mankind created were an attempt, all-to-often-short-term and bloody and self-defeating, to improve their tribal or national situation. The only justification for this brutality coming in the modern age by those who can see the benefits of social and economic progress over time.\nOthers however doggedly hold on to the idea that this progress (for example granting rights where they previously didn’t exist, putting an end to slavery) came at too high a cultural cost, namely that tribal or feudal systems were undermined.\nThis argument is of course, specious as there is no “culture” when a tribe is starving and the prospects of extinction are physical rather than merely cultural. Or alternatively, your “culture” renders disagreement with authority a capital offence. So to the ill-informed “youth” and the army of culturally confused “lefties and liberals”, we say stop idealising simple or brutal systems and imagine what it was, or in Saudi Arabia, is like, living under one of these systems.Particularly if you are female.\nHowever, while we don’t sympathise with the young on their view that global economic progress is bad, we do take a rather more negative view about their parents and grandparents responsibility for the personal challenges, uncertainties and the “social and economic sump” into which too many young people have been dumped.\nThis responsibility for the mess of the modern world is down to the “post-war liberal elite” and its aiders and abetters the army of “baby boomers”, the youngest of whom are now in their mid 40’s. This is something which the young don’t seem to recognise. It is something they seem unwilling to acknowledge. We want to know why!\nOf course, this “denial” by the young is like everything else in the west in part “engineered” by the liberal left elite who have the most to loose from a sudden awakening by the western world’s young that the progress of previous generations whilst bloody and incompetent was at least an attempt to create a better world for them. Contrast this with our present situation which is intended to be a consolidation for the middle-aged, middle class rather than progress for the young and poor. The poor came through for the seemingly well-meaning but totally bonkers Trump, the young stuck with Clinton. Why?\nWe believe with the western world today and its culture of “Secularwesternism” it is the first time in modern history that an older generation is determined to look after itself at the expense of its young and indeed the whole planet. But why are the young so impervious to this reality and what might be the consequences for liberal culture once the elite has destroyed it with their greed, hubris and stupidity?\nIt really is not fair to be too critical of the young. They have been fed a line since the mid-1990’s that the education system has been engineered for them. The abolition of Grammars has created opportunities, the emphasis on higher education has “raised the bar” along with access via student loans. Finally demanding education from employers for employees aged 16 to 18 has closed any gaps and skills shortages. Add to this the ridiculous “gifted and talented” programme of the early 2000’s and an emphasis by the millennial Blair government that it was cool to be young, cool to snog, cool to “get off with each other”.\nThe millennium decade was a period when “right on” adults tried to define a great future for the cool Britannia generation. This generation has come to maturity with a lot of mind shaping having gone most of it almost subliminally. Their thoughts then find expression in the one thought at a time Facebook post.\nAs far as we are concerned the reality is very different. The abolition of Grammars has denied the most academic working class children a chance to enter the establishment via the top universities. The proliferation of higher education courses paid for by student debt has kept academics in work whilst young people get often useless qualifications gaining no ability to think beyond a kind of cultural “group think”.\nThe conversion to “academic” courses from the impossible to arrange apprenticeships in the 2000’s resulted in young people becoming unskilled to do anything, hence immigration to fill the skills gap.\nThe parents, unaware of the left’s agenda encouraged their children’s indebtedness; “S/he’s the first to go to university” was a proud refrain in working class homes up and down the country.\nWe have described this as a bit of a left wing stitch up of the young. Maybe it was deliberate; an attempt to keep the left’s most loyal foot soldiers, the humanities academics in work. Maybe it was simple incompetence like much of “new Labour” policy.\nSo to address the question above; why don’t the young complain about the baby boomers outrageous snatch on their future. The simple answer is because they can’t. They can no more think in these terms with sufficient sophistication to argue their case than they can step outside of the group think of “identity politics” or tear themselves away from the narcissism of Facebook. We have a new feudal system called a “publicsectocracy” if you will, and the young are unfortunately its serfs.\nSome young people might be able to see the need to join us at a Blue Revolution. Most will simply fail to see that there is a problem.\nAnd finally what will be left when the elite have destroyed liberalism. Well, the elite are lining their own kids up to replace them at the top of the cultural and political pile, as there is little real talent or appetite for power further down. This almost feudal arrangement will be benign until the ignorance and aggression of the poor render the elite impatient to consolidate what has become their “dirty secret”; that they don’t like, trust or respect the people they are, for them unfortunately, still being paid to serve…….us!\n09.02.17 Gender fluidity a gift from Daddy! What does this actually mean to the girl or boy involved?\nA popular British ‘Marxist’ comedian has indicated that he would like his newborn daughter to have none of the pressure associated with the whole business of gender…that whole business of each of us having different “farm parts” determined by our gender.\nBut isn’t the real issue not the difference between a male and female person’s “farm parts” but what they do with them. If you simply talk about gender as being “fluid” you will encourage confusion, uncertainty and distress. A child has a right to know what it is not, so as it matures it is capable of deciding who it is. Can you imagine the confusion a child will face when asking “daddy what sex” am I and our “right on daddy” says “I don’t know and I don’t care….you can be either or neither it is up to you”.\nHowever, even if you rely on a lazy analysis of past and current social norms then you have an argument which has some validity and social value. You can with this approach ascribe a gender to your child but then say “whilst girls usually wear pink and like kittens and boys wear blue and play conkers (cultural reference alert) it doesn’t have to be like that”.\nBeing the kind of guys and gals we are, we would like to add a further dimension to this perplexing gender debate. A Marxian perspective if you like. Gender is only really relevant in the modern economy for one reason and that is that it determines the type of consumption which typically can be targetted at you. Consumption patterns are something you can change. A simple choice anyone can make to buy or not buy on the basis of gender-related marketing.\nUnfortunately, there are legacy issues linked to gender which remain more significant than mere gender-related consumption, these relate to biology but are combined with essentially tribal social values and still affect male and female roles today.\nGender is still used by many to determine their primitive biological roles and “priorities”. In the past, there was no choice about the role of impregnator or impregnated. These reproductive gender roles are today choices and, take place within a modern gender fluid western society.\nWestern society has many flaws, but it has strengths as well. Aside from gender-related consumption choices, reproduction has become a legitimate “choice” for western women and couples. However, in the west, too many reproductive choices are actually a massive welfare liability, which is why tribes strictly control reproduction. The word liability applies because in the west far too many reproductive decisions fail to take account of the need to raise children. Too few take our primitive roles seriously anymore and the taxpayer picks up the tag for children who no one really wants to raise, gendered or otherwise. Contrast this with third world economies where gender is taken very seriously and upon which different rights and social roles apply to men and women.\nSo gender fluidity in a gender-ambivalent and reproductively amoral society is unnecessary. No one has to buy what is ascribed to their gender nor behave in the traditional way expected of their gender, and sire or carry and bear babies unless they want to. If they do thoughtlessly the responsibility will ultimately fall to the taxpayer.\nThe issue, therefore, isn’t what gender you are or are not, but what you do with your gender or you don’t do with it. Please, someone, tell daddy.\n09.02.17 Following on from “populism” and the rise of a people’s agenda we ask, why can’t the left and the liberal elite compete with populism?\nIt must be something to do with the march of history. The people are better placed than the experts to ensure the survival of their culture. The elite and the left united it seems to us in one simple belief that they should guide the masses towards a future defined and shaped by them; with their preoccupations and concerns the focal point for the policies that supposedly steer the interests of the masses. This creates a roughly 50:50 split between the people (the masses) and the combined establishment.\nThe problem is that the masses; that unpredictable and often violently revolutionary mob no longer see the link between the values of the left or the elite and their own basic needs, considerations and concerns. We believe that this has a lot to do with the fact that the left and the liberal elite have something that the masses can no longer enjoy and that is personal security. The left are too prone to lionise the role of the state as some kind of paternalistic protector of the masses, whilst the liberal elite are more than happy to engineer an economic “success” which casts jobs into off-shore oblivion whilst replacing real jobs with state non-jobs and an education system which metastases stupidity at every level below that of the elite itself.\nWe thus see the masses trapped between a “benign” authoritarianism which taxes and spends to preserve itself whilst destroying creativity, industry and ambition or as an alternative, a liberal “third way culture” which promotes “free market” principles which offer zero hours contracts, an economy dependent on the toxicity of debt, plus any one of a number of means of maintaining the aggregate demand, the means by which the elites measure their political success. It doesn’t matter to them if the state apparatus has over-reached itself and this has resulted in abandoned elderly, poor education, student debt and a squandering of the planet’s resources.\nFor both the left and the elite the world’s poor are migrating because they are locked out of growth at home be it North Africa or Asia, but as long as they the elite can see “growth” at home they fudge the issue; none more so than the EU.\nPopulism then in our opinion could be much greater than the roughly 50:50 split so far identified. As long as the next “revolution” is predicated on the principles of Contract, Choice and Concent and this supports democracy and freedom giving rise to a fairness in the distribution of power and wealth, we can’t see either the liberal elite of the left having much to offer. The evidence for this seems to be starting to take hold with Clinton’s lukewarm support in the US and Corbyn’s in the UK. We just need to light the Blue touchpaper and stand back.\n11.02.17 The London and south east effect and the myth of its transferability.\nIf you lived in London in the 1950’s or early 1960’s you would not recognise the place today. Of course, some landmarks will prevail for centuries but the rest of the city morphs and changes year in and year out. Where the small towns of the north remain stable or in a sort of genteel decline the big three English cities evolve, and the really big daddy of the process is London.\nSince 1960 London and the other two big English cities (Birmingham and Manchester) have lost huge manufacturing and other big industries and these have been replaced by the high-tech and service industries, we describe as “the real economy” today. It is this economic change which has changed the character of the big cities. With the decline of an “industrial” working class and an imperceptible shift from production to debt backed consumption as the basis of the cities regional economy, the world has been knocking on the cities doors.\nWe believe that the what has altered the city economy has been the success of globalisation. Globalisation has created “global” industries which require a global workforce which is mobile and able to adapt to changes in climate and culture. Around this phenomenon has sprung up the global citizen, the character that is so beloved of the liberal elite and in the Uk those who wish to remain within the EU.\nHowever, globalisation may benefit I.T. Banking and other high skill sectors which push beyond the UK for a workforce a kind of petit-bourgeois workforce, but to service, this phenomenon of a global petit-bourgeois workforce the unskilled are also required and none are more adaptable than the global proletariat. They come to the UK and share houses and live a life far removed from their lives at home wherever they come from (eastern Europe, East Africa or the Philippines). They fit into the city-state because they have none of the pre-occupations and hang-ups that in the UK our own “proletariat” have been conditioned to obsess about. These include health care for the deliberately unhealthy, welfare and perhaps a two or three bedroom home provided for them, and paid for by the state, so they can bring up their fatherless/motherless child in an isolated and lonely comfort their limited economic worth could not possibly pay for. There is even an unwillingness to move from a declining location to secure employment in another more prosperous location leaving the way wide open for the global proletariat to step in.\nThe wider British economy, is therefore made to contort itself with state (taxpayer?) debt so it can provide health, welfare and meet regional housing expectations based on a model that exists only in the provinces with their old and all too often under-employable second generation ex-industrial workforce. This model has since the 1960’s been largely abandoned by the city-state as a result of global conditions.\nSo is this “city-state” model transferable? In short, we believe not. To accommodate the needs of the provinces the economic expectations need to become more realistic. It is not possible to create a local economy based on the city-state model without unnecessary mass housing and an economic infrastructure that not only provides services but provides jobs and accommodation relevant to the needs of the individual worker. The provinces are not like a city-state, they can’t provide the well-paid jobs that create the trickle down economy. They would simply become areas with over-stretched social resources (schools, health etc) which remain highly dependent on “top up” welfare for a migrant population that can neither be effectively housed or effectively employed.\nThe answer is to stop welfare for all new migrants and get the provinces working again. It sounds like an unappealing solution but trust us if engineered properly it will transform Britain without trying to make Grimsby, Greater London.\n14.02 17 First version The Blue Revolution Manifesto\nIntroduction\nThe world goes through revolutionary upheavals every hundred years or so and semi-revolutions every half century. The last one in the UK was in 1997 when Tony Blair acquired the mandate to secure the state’s total moral and social dominion over its people. In the U.S. Clinton achieved the same thing. The whole “third way” was based on the idea that the intellectual elite knew better that the public what was good for them. To avoid this process of change being merely “utopian” i.e. just aspirational froth, the left wing liberal elite knew that there would have to be some underpinning economic model that could funnel funds into the projects that would save the people from themselves and deliver Blair and Clinton’s New Jerusalem. They believed it would work.\nThe economic model chosen was one where Government spending would be deployed to boost economic growth and thisin turn it was believed would empower people to achieve their potential. The era of naïve economics and identity politics was born, to a fanfare of “things can only get better” by D:Ream.\nThe public were in part seduced by this model. Blair seemed like a nice guy – and who could argue that in the UK public expenditure was there to be spent on health, welfare, and achieving via every public-sector outlet, the vision of a multi-coloured kaleidoscopic Great Britain; a Britain shorn of reactionary forces like national pride, belief in the family, and personal responsibility. Who needs that stuff when the state is there to go beyond intervening from the cradle to the grave and can now usefully occupy itself interfering with the public’s mind too? These old ideas thought the new left would be consigned to the dustbin of history, just as surely as bonded serfdom and illiteracy had been.\nThe only problem was that the economics didn’t really stack up if you knew what was really going on. So along with the Financial Crisis of 2007/8 the other consequences of this utterly naïve model have been expanding wealth inequality and the inability of the state to make good its 1997 promises (regardless of who is in power) and a growing burden on the taxpayers of the present and future to pay to keep this whole shambolic system in existence.\nThis misfiring model is what we at a Blue Revolution call the Secular Western hegemony or more simply “secular westernism”. This secular western model is well established and will need a new revolution to shift it. Not a Red Revolution because Red Revolutions are, like the Red Revolutions in China and Russia or indeed the UK after World War II, effectively a triumph of the state over the individual, albeit with an initially benign intention.\nA revolution will be needed because just like the aristocrats in the past, the modern big winners of the state system, the politicians, bureaucrats, charity chiefs, and third sector organisations, the publicsectocracy as we call them, won’t want to give up the power, status and wealth that goes with their elevated positions. They also will not want to re-order the economy to reduce the super-rich who benchmark “top” wages and provide funding and sponsorship for elite causes including politics.\nIf you believe that today government, democracy, welfare, international relations and basic rights don’t pass the sniff test, you may be feeling the initial stirrings of becoming a Blue Revolutionary. So Please read on.\nBlue Revolution\nNewcastle-Under-Lyme\nDecember 31st 2016\nThe rest has been removed for hard copy publication.",

Bob Geldoff somehow caught the spirit of Mrs May back in 1978 and after the one nation One Show sofa saga it seems opportune to remind ourselves that modern politics is currently being cast in the past, the 1970’s for both Mr Corbyn and Mrs May. We would suggest a little earlier for Mr Corbyn, perhaps 1973 to Mrs Mays 1976. In any event, we are experiencing politics which is clearly forty years out of date. Brexit which should be understood by all as a liberation from the yoke of an oppressive and tax gobbling overlord is seen by many an opportunity to renegotiate on the basis of a 1970’s EEC-type iteration of the EU. Not wholly bad but again a bit 1970’s.\nThe problem with the EU and its component parts is that it is manifestly inefficient like a middle-aged man living comfortably off a credit card with a huge credit limit but who’s income always seems to fall a little short of expenditure each month “old boy!”. As a result of this predictable long-term terminal decline we have a duty to not just to try to negotiate a safe 1970’s EEC style deal, if indeed we get that, we still might get nothing, but we should also be a critical friend to the countries of the EU. Like the disassociation that exists between the parliamentary system in the UK and the people who pay for, it the EU is not hugely popular with many ordinary Europeans. Like the Brits with Brexit, most EU citizens understand the EU doesn’t pass the sniff test but they are powerless to deal with it as no mainstream party wants to come on board. Like Clegg and Cameron, the mainstream continental parties see the EU as an exciting place to waffle, shuffle paper, and make a lot of money from somewhere. Macron is like that too so all the best to France. So we should stop being so 1970’s in our dealings with the EU and help the EU reach a position of sane self-awareness.\nThe EU is a continental sized liability a few short watery miles away and we are not living in 1976. The threat of the EU is enormous not as a warrior but as an unstable and unsustainable economic behemoth. A rendering back of power to nations states with an EEC style deal for all of the countries of the EU would at least offer the prospect of a controlled implosion when it finally comes. As it is we are facing at some point the collapse of a bloated arrogant and self-deluded pseudo-nation state with all the horrendous economic and social consequences its collapse will inflict on both them and us.\nIt is not good being too 1970’s about this, Mrs May needs to understand that it’s not just what you wear and what you say…..it’s what you think that matters and in what decade you think it!!",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-faith-of-islam-vs-christian-values-it-might-just-be-about-economics/content_350.html": "The faith of Islam and our “Christian values”. It might just be about ancient economics.\nIntroduction\nThis paper is not a critique of faith. That is in the hearts and minds of the believer, something for which we have full and unequivocal respect. This paper will seek to put the case for different religions reflecting different material circumstances at any point in history. As it was in Marx’s day for he and Engels believed the Christian religion reinforced the then nineteenth-century bourgeois world order.\nPerhaps to maintain the domination of economics and politics by a capitalist economic elite, the idea took root that all morality was “relative” in other words you could not say one set of moral principles was better or more just than any other. However, with the rise of global communication, the world needs to reflect on moral relativism and perhaps having adopted it because of its anti-Marxist and pro “bourgeois” credentials, think about where moral relativism is leading the world today.\nFrom Savagery to Barbarism according to Frederick Engels\nKarl Marx and but more specifically Frederick Engels were in the final analysis moral absolutists. However, the Economically liberal Western world, perhaps out of fear that a single unifying moral perspective might deliver Marx’s egalitarian revolution, adopted moral relativism in the nineteenth century and it still holds a commanding position today. The problem with relativism is that it makes it difficult to say any moral principle or value is wrong.\nMoral relativism has for over one hundred years silenced our left-leaning liberal elite and has set them on a collision course with the ordinary worker who has a clear idea of right and wrong based on their ordinary western workers’ economic experience. The difference between religious moral absolutism and that of Marx and Engels is that they believed there was a scientific and economic explanation for humanities various “moral iterations”. These iterations placed one period of Humanities evolution above the other as we evolved from the savagery of the stone age through various stages of barbarism and finally into the period of civilization. The modern age. The description of this process can be found in Engels: The origin of the family, private property and the state (1884).\nThe theory simply put states that as humankind gained increasing levels of control over nature, by applying our unique ability to dominate the natural environment, the social and moral environment changed correspondingly. This ability to dominate nature is called by Marx and Engels “species-essence”.\nEngels was clear that this process of economic and therefore moral and social evolution was not a simple process. The environment and levels of science and technology played a part in different groups of humans around the world. Therefore, taken at any point in history, there would be a range of different economic and social models operating at the same time but for those with similar levels of economic sophistication, there would be more similarities than differences.\nEven today it’s possible to trace traditions that have been carried over from one period of economic and social evolution into another almost as if a ghost of a long forgotten past when material circumstances were markedly more primitive. The Scots Clans, for example, reflect a period when society was divided into tribal groupings. Even though the need for such groupings has not been present since Scotland emerged into the modern age, there is a certain modern pride in Clan identity.\nThe Native American had a tribe and clan-based society. When civilisation in the form of the “West” arrived on their shores they experienced a world alien to their simple tribal economic and social arrangements. Whilst they possessed many skills that enhanced their survival they were as a society characterised by two or three significant differences from the civilisations that would eventually conquer them.\nThese differences would be shared by all groups who were at a similar stage of economic and therefore social and moral development.\nOne of these characteristics was what Engels called consanguinuity. This is marriage like relationships within the wider family group, loose sexual unions where women would have several possible partners and as a result, lineage had to be taken via the female. The primacy of the female, called “mother right”, was due to certainty over maternity. If a brother and sister both had sons, the sister’s son was more important to the tribe than the brother’s son as maternity was a matter of fact and paternity rather more a matter of opinion. This gave women status in this period. However economic development and the development of wealth and trade would eventually change women’s status for the worse until fighting back for rights in the latter part of the modern age we call ‘now’.\nIn addition to these simple and loose marriage arrangements which would in time be classed as adulterous, the absence of private property was another characteristic of this period. It was impossible to build up “wealth” or in Marx’s term surplus economic value. Thus, any goods made by Native Indians, for example, had essentially use value only. They fulfilled an obvious purpose, for example, a spear for hunting or headdress for a warrior’s status. When food was sourced it was consumed collectively. It could not be stored. This wasn’t exactly a hand to mouth experience of the earlier period of “savagery” but it wasn’t full mastery over nature, in the modern sense either.\nThe final characteristic of this period was a strict but non-abusive distinction between male and female roles within the tribe. Men were hunters and warriors and females were child bearers and homemakers. There was a greater equality between the sexes than became the case as humanity evolved. Women were given status arising from their lack of reproductive ambiguity.\nIt is possible to consider numerous peoples from antiquity for whom lifestyle was similar in character. If food was short wars would be fought to conquer or be conquered. In such inauspicious circumstances economic and therefore social progress was practically impossible. It was a society on a war and starvation footing all the time. Rome, Greece and the land of Israel, as well as the desert lands all of the Middle East, would all have evolved from this model of “barbarism”.\nIt was the absence of creating wealth or exchangeable surplus economic value that for Engels is the fundamental condition that determines the social character of these “barbaric” societies. Their lives were overall simple but precarious and sometimes violent.\nIn Europe and the Middle East with no isolation as happened to Native Americans or Australasians, there was the possibility of progress, as different groups began to forge different economic circumstances and trade alliances which gave way to new forms of social and moral behaviour. For women, it proved to be a backward step.\nThe Mediterranean provided opportunities for nations like Greece and Rome to struggle free from the shackles of nature’s hard to conquer dominion. The consequence, however, was, with growing wealth accumulation and the evolution of wealth backed “status” a creeping dominion by man over man and more tellingly man over woman started to emerge. The tribal past with its relaxed moral values and lack of paternal certainty became an intolerable burden on the ability of men to create and command wealth and exercise power.\nThis next stage one move on from mere tribalism is the precursor to the development of early civilisation and the growth of the state. Once humanity was able to create surplus value via farming, herding, and manufacture for exchange, as well as store wealth in the form of gold and silver, the desire to gain power through wealth and control the environment both physically and morally increased.\nEconomics drove the wish for power, just as it does now, and as a result, it ushered in some revolutionary social and moral changes. With surplus value or wealth, there came the power men craved. This power could be concentrated into the hands of families or individuals who by controlling conception and inheritance became more important than the tribes they replaced. The value of mother right was eroded as men of wealth no longer needed to share women and have only ‘opinion’ as to who was the father of a child. It was possible to guarantee paternity via the absolute control of women and it made sense for men to turn their backs on the simple tribalism that saw greater equality between the sexes. The morality of this period is captured in Holy books like the Old Testament and the Koran. The faithful believe that the changes were a direct instruction from God. The reality for Marx and Engels and ourselves is that it came from powerful economic forces. Genesis 17.1-7, 15,16 captures the theology as opposed to the economics of this period quite well.\nThus, wealth enslaved women and it enslaved other men too as communities could be fed and housed avoiding the need to slaughter them and their labour power could be used to gain economic advantage, all based on “ownership”. This is better known as slavery. The slave society was merely a society that had achieved a greater mastery over nature and this mastery was no longer evenly distributed. For those with wealth, it gave mastery over others too.\nIt was during this period that the three great religions began to reflect in the articles of their faith the economic realities of their day. Arguably Lot’s wife and Sodom and Gomorrah is a reference to the abandonment of mother right (and all the liberty for women that went with it) in favour of father right and the all-powerful monotheistic male God.\nThe Old Testament, New Testament and Koran reflect social change only because economic reality had changed ahead of it. In the form of these new religions, society catches up and codifies the rules of the new world economic order.\nWithin Islam, the process of rejecting the old ways takes longer to become established. The tradition of nomadic tribes and prior to the seventh-century little-written record keeping might explain why it was harder for the Arab nations to build up wealth. But none the less by the seventh century the growth and more importantly the wealth of global economics was making it possible for certain groups and individuals within Arab tribes to secure a greater share of the worlds riches and as a result allowed men to violently shunt aside the “gods” that reflected mother right just as the Jews and Christians had done.\nArguably therefore for the Arab tribes of the seventh century, the culture of mother right and the loose ’uneconomic’ morals that went with it was becoming untenable. To men who were, as Mohammed was, able to secure wealth through trade and war there was a mission to put to an end the practices of the past as the benefits of trade and wealth would be lost if the old order wasn’t removed. Therefore, adultery became a grave crime punishable with great cruelty and women were forced to adopt a level of modesty that would render them invisible but for their reproductive functions. However not wishing to miss out altogether on multiple female partners concessions to the old order were given in the form of polygamy……but just for the male.\nThe new values were all embracing reflecting this masculine economic change and the wealth and power it created over others. Within the Middle East, there had been a period of great trade and enlightenment and the religion of Islam was adopted widely conferring stability on tribal societies in many parts of the world. The word caliphate is little different from Christendom. Each faith believing it reflects the formula for economic success and therefore moral purity. But the driver was and still is in our view economic rather than theological. Had it not made economic sense to adopt new economic principles such as restricting women’s rights no society would have.\nEngels didn’t touch on the Middle East in The origin of the family, private property and the state, concentrating on North America, Britain and Europe. It has been possible because of the strength of his writing and his “scientific” method to explore the role of economics in religion, morality and society outside of the areas of his interest.\nWe can explore what it means to us in the twenty-first century as we try and grasp the emerging cultural conflict with Islam and other faith beliefs across Britain and Western Europe.\nThe web and Twitter are littered with groups who see Islam as anything from a death cult to the hairspring for Armageddon. The response from some Christian groups is to rage with as much fervour as a Jihadi and even some secular thinkers who promote the idea of a clash of cultures seem to conclude that the answer for the Western world is a restating of “Christian values”. We say this solution to solving the incompatibility of Islam and other faiths with western liberal culture will work. And here is why.\nFirstly, Christianity, as we have said earlier like all faiths, reflects material realities and therefore is no different from the Islamic faith or any other comparable faith, in this respect. The abandonment of mother right and the adoption of a fearsome God was all part of an economic change that took place when tribalism gave way to more productive ways of creating wealth and more importantly storing it and owning it. There may be some differences in application but essentially the outcome for women, for example, was the same, a culture of varying degrees of subjugation. Although it does have to be conceded that Islam has cruelty, so in the past did Hinduism with the practice of Sati ensuring economic needs were reflected in enforced moral behaviour.\nEconomic circumstances having created a male-centric God to reflect male-centric wealth creation and values, the wealth created came into the hands of a few families headed by men and it stayed there. This is a unifying fact across all Middle Eastern and European religions, up to roughly the 16th century.\nChristianity, therefore, has no great claim to being peaceful or ‘moral’. Unimaginable horror was inflicted on people in the name of Christianity particularly in the Sixteenth Century when a Christian faith Catholicism was propping up an economic system, the feudal system which was being assailed by a new theology called Calvinism. Calvinism itself, of course, a product of evolving economic forces namely the ‘laws’ of the free market and capitalism. At this time the engine of the economy was controlled by an aristocracy and an ambitious and increasingly wealthy middle class wanted a change. Calvin and Luther provided the theology!\nThe bourgeois revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth–centuries in Britain and the nineteenth century in Europe reset the clock for Christianity, giving it a benign ‘bourgeois’ appearance based on contract, choice and consent that ignored its origin and violent use over the years.\nIslam in the West today is no different from Christianity in the past. It still reflects values that hark back to the abandonment of mother right and the exercising of control over women arising out of the accumulation of wealth and its inheritance. The difference between Islam and Christianity, however, is Christianity has been forced to go through several convulsions due to the changing economic circumstances in the West and specifically the need for Contract, Choice and Consent to be established so as to ensure the smooth operation of the bourgeois capitalist system.\nSo, when people with an Islamic background are preaching, or arguing about the Wests immorality and advocating FGM, veiling, stoning or beheading they are essentially speaking from the moral perspective of a culture steeped in seventh-century economic necessity full of obedience, honour, violence and force with little if any choice or rights. The problem is the West doesn’t challenge these outmoded and economically irrelevant views.\nOf the West, the devout Muslim would and does highlight our ‘shame’ and the weakness of our Christianity which has been shorn of anything other than supporting personal choice. But that is because our free market requires that characteristic. Everything is about economics, today yesterday and forever. And the Muslim faithful take advantage of this economic reality too. The world is unfair and unequal and it offends people of faith….or it should do.\nThe question on all sides in the cultural head to head is this. Once you have stripped out the faith belief and stare at the hard realities of these ancient moral principles and values, one Christian the other Islamic or whatever, you can see that the debate is really about which one is fit for purpose in the 21st century and that is down to economics and economics alone.\nThe Within all faiths there are passionate and devout advocates for purity. The Jihadi who wants to destroy civilisation really wants to bring coherence to his seventh-century social values by creating a seventh-century economic environment with the destruction of “civilisation”. The shrouded woman advocating stoning adulterers or beating wives is a ghost from a bygone era still fighting to destroy rights that women lost over one thousand years ago to male power and dominion, before struggling to regain many of them back in the twenty-first century. But still not fully.\nWearing the Hijab or full veiling of a more extreme kind may be a free choice, it may be a political statement or even simply cultural expectation or it may simply be an example of seventh-century moral behaviour to demonstrate adherence to “faith”.\nSimilarly, the shrill Christian evangelicals with their Armageddon theology and the earnest men praying in a park are making a statement are all are playing a game……but it is simply a twenty-first-century economic one based on free choice in a free country. We should all see what is going on and understand the “theology” of it. It’s only ancient economics after all.",

We are sure that you have been contacted by some groups criticizing this definition which the government has chosen not to adopt. We are an organisation that represents a small number of working people and some of us identify ourselves as classically Marxist in our approach to Politics. We too are concerned that you have adopted this definition and we will explain why.\nFirstly, according to the views of Karl Marx all religion represents different stages in the development of human consciousness. Marx described this evolution of consciousness in terms of humanity casting off “snake skins” and different religions represent different stages in that process. As our consciousness matures over millennia, some groups gain power and come to recognise, ‘injustice’ and ‘unfairness’ within the context of their life experience and on the back of new material realities changes in thinking take place. Religion thus reflects past material circumstances and is therefore ideological, promoting a material reality which works to the advantage of some groups over others, men over women for example.\nHowever, religion differs from mere ideology in that unlike an ideology (like socialism or communism for example) it is identified with the divine. In the case of Christianity, the divine is the personhood of Jesus the son of God, in the case of Islam, the divine is the Qur’an Gods word dictated to Muhammed by the Archangel Gabriel. By promoting Islamophobia as “a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness” you are at risk of protecting from criticism ideas that have little modern relevance and indeed may advance the cause of a consciousness which accepts different moral standards to many promoted in the twenty-first century West. In Marxist terms you are asking us or at least some of us to try and re-enter or remain within, a now discarded snakeskin, at least discarded in much of the liberal western world.\nOne final point and that relates to the frankly inaccurate claim that Islamophobia is a type of racism. By including this in your definition you essentially turn all criticism of Islam into racism and people who legitimately criticise Islam into racists. This may not be what you intend to do, we are sure your consciousness has evolved to the point where you wish to defend freedom of expression and freedom of speech. However, your definition will make it increasingly hard for those who wish to challenge Islam to do so.\nWe are fully in support of any definition of Islamophobia which is intended to protect the rights of individuals to speak their truth even if their ideas represent the views of an earlier age or period of collective consciousness and therefore may offend. However, it must be a definition which refers to protecting people rather than ideas, ideologies or faiths. This is the twenty-first century and all working people and those of all faiths and none need to speak their truth openly and without fear of persecution or indeed prosecution.\nBlue Revolution",

But how well do they protect our rights?\nAll societies need to possess two basic characteristics, the ability to create economic value as well as social coherence. In a nut shell the ability to feed and water themselves and the ability to live within their means and maintain social order. The creation of value is an economic activity that taps into the cohesive society to provide the labour necessary to survive as a population and thrive as a culture.\nIn the Western world, however, we no longer see the need to do this. Because we can maintain utterly incoherent societies and pay for them with a mixture of Wizard of Oz-like financial jiggery-pokery combined with some Alice in Wonderland economics. This is the system we at Blue Revolution call Secularwesternism. It is the prevalent ideology of the Western world. We all buy into it and governments are too scared or stupid to know how to change it or change our appetite for it and its unsustainable debt funded gobbling up of the planet’s resources. It is the most damaging and unsustainable ideology that has ever evolved and it will collapse leaving economic and social devastation in its wake. The western characteristics (Contract, Choice, and Consent) upon which democracy is founded, forged by Capitalism and extended by left-leaning capitalist governments to more and more people will disappear in a trice.\nThere are already those religious fanatics who can see the weakness of Western society and the shameful economic model that props it up and believe they can bomb us back into what is for them a more coherent “dark-ages”, but for us would be a Sharia inspired return to a pre 18th, 17th or even 16th Century world of prejudice and discrimination. Assuming, of course, you could maintain anything that resembled a “State”.\nUnfortunately for the devout Muslim with all their laudable devotions and traditional garb Sharia offers nothing “progressive” to the West, or anywhere for that matter. In this respect, it is no different to from the Old Testament. Islamism will stop Western progress in its tracks. But then Secularwesternism is doing the same thing but in a different way.\nIn addition to Islamism as an ideology jockeying to topple Western hegemony, we have the left wing getting in on the act. Now “the left” is an interesting hotchpotch of often incoherent ideas which have little basis in the economic reality of the Western world. So in China (and to some extent Russia), we have State Capitalism. This is the Capitalist System grafted onto an essentially feudal state. This is possible because unlike in industrializing Britain where Capitalism deposed feudalism confining it in the West to the historical dustbin, China can run the two systems in parallel.\nIn Britain, we have a collection of well-intentioned Mumsnetters and students who support Corbyn, the man who gives a well-meaning and harmless gloss to a party of Leninists, Stalinists anti-Semites, and Misogynists. The Corbyn Labour party is all about creating a Leninist like “Vanguard” (Momentum) seizing power on behalf of the “workers” and then re-ordering the “State” with a Stalinist like grip to deliver a new “socialist” society for the workers. It’s a horrible thought for us ordinary workers as it would turn Britain into a kind of bureaucratic hellhole, with workers, working to provide status and taxpayer-funded debt based wealth to an aggressive party elite. Rights would give way to the grand plan until the economy went pop.\nThe worst part of the Labour model is its complete lack of economic literacy. Unlike the Islamist who can see the absence of real social and economic value creation in the West, the British left still thinks the West makes real value from its coffee shops, restaurants and Malls selling tat, and that this value is controlled by a taxable business elite. No Guys, the West does not make real value based money it creates government and personal debt, and yes it does go to a business, banking and political elite that includes the Labour Party. And Labour would simply make the problem worse. Anti-austerity is the cause of the problem, not the solution. In the absence of real “re-appropriated value” to use a Marxist phrase, the only source of government finance apart from taxation is debt. The only way we can see to pay for schools and hospitals is to cut the cost of the State itself. But that, of course, is where the left wing gets their power from, now they have no Nationalised Industries to destroy. So we can’t expect a radical change there then!\nOn a more farcical note, we have the muddle of “Trumpism” which was (is) a nieve idea that somehow TPOTUS could order the US economy back to the 1950’s.\nThere is also Macronism, the nieve idea that Tony Blair was an enlightened thinker.\nIt is the workers, not the elite who will experience the horror of the West’s eventual demise and so far none of our pretenders to the Crown offers anything remotely realistic or in the case of Islamism humane.

The Mayoral Combined Authority and the Police and Crime Commissioner are similar attempts to pretend there is more democracy, when there is less.\nIf there is less democracy you have less influence over political decision making, decisions like how money is spent in your area or holding your local authority to account. Government is getting less democratic and less accountable in general and whilst the political system needs radical change, the Government’s White Paper is not the solution.\nA vote for me will show that we know what is going on.

The Labour Party sure as hell would like to find it. However, they are largely responsible for turning the second and third generation of unemployed industrial and agricultural workers into the so-called underclass…a group who lack both a voice and a reputation for militant class rebellion.\nThis happened because hapless Blair, Brown and Balls “globalised” the British economy exporting jobs to China where there were no trade deals but cheap labour and importing workers from the EU where they would benefit from the Brown welfare reforms of tax credits and “in work benefits” due to EU regulations. The resulting effects were to stimulate the Brexit debate as it became clear that the ex-industrial workers were not finding jobs of equal quality but were being largely overlooked by an economy that could find no useful role for them. The minimum wage didn’t really help. This was intended to “protect” the British workers from the downward pressure on wages that would result from opening up the labour market. It quickly became a maximum wage and with other costs associated with being in work, it deterred British workers from coming off welfare and getting a job.\nAny intelligent government would have realised that this worker dislocation should drive policy decisions to correct the effects of globalisation but for Blair, Brown and Co as long as the free market generated tax revenue and these ex-workers could be paid welfare the system was tolerable. The free market was, however, trading in toxicity as became apparent in 2007/08.\nThe situation has changed little. The ex-industrial and agricultural workers continue to clutter up various public sector waiting rooms and the NHS, producing children with multiple disadvantages, whilst the exporters of their jobs enjoy super-profits that if not tax avoided generates nothing like the tax they should. So who are the revolutionary class now? Well everyone who pays for a Parliamentary system that has failed to reflect the expectations of the people and now simply reflects it’s own need to govern.\nThe British state and it’s institutions (Parliament, the Law, the military and local government) is bureaucratic slow-witted and out of touch. We have an eighteenth century legal and military system, a nineteenth century parliamentary and penal system and a twentieth-century education and welfare system. In view of this, it is time ordinary taxpayers embarked on a revolution to change for good what the British state does and how it does it and to drive down how much it costs so we can drive down taxation. The industrial workers don’t exist because mass employment in “industry” no longer exists, we have to reflect this in our next revolution by appealing to the new “working class”.",

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_the-uk-labour-party-socialism-and-the-state/content_132.html": "The UK Labour Party, ‘Socialism’ and the State.\nMarx was a classical economist which explains why he wanted actual workers to ‘own’ the means of production. Workers, free from the need to work longer hours than necessary would have time off for politics, recreation and family life. Capitalists, of course, exploited workers by taking workers working hours so they could make a profit (Capital) and become, like an aristocracy. An aristocracy based on wealth acquisition rather than inherited status. Like elites, they forced additional effort from the workers but without actually going as far as killing them. Capitalists needed a workforce.\nSocialism is the reaction of the State to that exploitative situation. A ‘socialist’ State takes the wealth from the capitalist and spends it on the workers. It doesn’t, however, go as far as giving the workers the ‘means of production’ but offers welfare etc. Workers still have to work the capitalists hours.\nWorkers are thus exploited by the State! Go too far with this model however and the State not only undermines the systems productive capacity it enslaves the workers as well. ‘Socialist’ States thus stop serving the workers and start to serve themselves. Hitler/Stalin/Mao get into power promoting the rights of workers but end up enslaving the working class……and often killing them.\nToday we have a ‘Left-wing’ of such obvious naivety it has no idea what it’s role is supposed to be in what is in effect a 21st-century post ‘capitalist’ age.\nTo maintain its relevance as a ‘socialist’ party the Labour Party gathers together a collection of senior State and charity employees plus a massive constituency of the politically lame and out of touch. It became a party of minority and sectarian interests united in the belief that any ‘identity’ other than ‘worker’ is radical even if the identity is simply not being a Tory. Identity without economic relevance is utopian nonsense. There is no united, militant economically exploited industrial working class anymore, just a big bunch of people who hate their lives, the Tories, real workers with Brexit opinions and probably each other\nThe left cannot depart from its historical self-belief or their faith in the transformative power of the socialist State because it is ‘socialist’ and proudly so. But it is no longer revolutionary. Its revolution was fought, won and then became irrelevant between 1945 and 1979.\nSocialism is now is now counter-revolutionary. It’s trying to persuade its members and voters to once again empower a socialist State and in doing so undermine the working people. Under socialism, empowering workers has never been on the cards. Socialism is all about the State.\nThe next revolution we get must to minimise the cost of the State and politically empower the workers. Socialism won’t do that because it can’t.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-history-of-politics-simplified/content_232.html": "The history of politics, simplified.\nThe history of politics, simplified.\nBlue Revolution.\nWhen it comes to politics, we all feel confused. ‘Left’, ‘Right’ or maybe ‘Centre’. Liberal or totalitarian, Socialist, Revolutionary Socialist. What all these political ideas lack is a broad understanding by ordinary people.\nPolitical change has always involved a small group of sometimes angry people like some of those above taking control of the state in the name of ‘the people’. This has never been a good idea, but it continues to go on, even now. Politics is therefore about power, who has it, how they get it and what they do with it.\nThis pamphlet was written to help the curious. It adopts a modern theory based on peoples’ experience. We call it ‘lived reality’. Today it reflects the reality of living in a globalised ‘free market’, but ‘lived reality’ works just as well for the lives of people in the past.\nOur lived reality, therefore, describes how we got to where we are economically, politically and socially.\nAccording to the Blue Revolution, all political decisions should be grounded in the reality of all working people- not a small minority. The last time this happened was thousands of years ago when we lived in tribal communities.\nIn Box\nPolitics is confusing. Too many political ideas are in existence with many ideas conflicting. Politics is all about how politicians, be they kings, political party members or business leaders get power, or influence those who have it. But it is also about how ordinary people experience the power of politics.\nChapter one\nPower in ‘tribal’ communities. A harsh equality starting in the Middle East.\nThe earliest type of organisation is the tribe: a community of people and basic rules and principles which ensured order.\nRules controlled every aspect of life. For example, ‘marriage’, which today is a legal ‘contract’ between two adults in tribal times was instead an arrangement between different males and females in a tribe. In a tribe, rules were just accepted. Broken rules were punishable by death in order to preserve the values necessary to protect all its members.\nThings like child marriage were not considered strange, the average age of death was 33 years old. The tribes’ survival depended upon it. Child ‘marriage’ minimised problems of adjustment by putting children in different households at a very early age.\nReligion evolved from economic necessity and reflected the need for survival. Religions were used to legitimate authority and control behaviour. Stability created economic and social value.\nTribal rules required a fair distribution to all. Generally, men hunted while women reared children and were homemakers. There was a strict division of labour, but men and women would have been equally as important to the maintenance of the tribe. This is the sort of world that Islam’s prophet Muhammed would have known and explains why Islamic ideas take the form they do and why some Muslims are outraged by modern criticism of what are essentially the social and economic values portrayed in the Qur’an. ‘Islamism’ is an attempt by some radicalised Muslims to promote these ideas and impose them on others by force. They unquestioningly accept as ‘truth’ the Muslim holy book the Qur’an.\nMost but not all tribal societies evolved over many thousands of years. Australia and what became the USA before Europeans arrived, were cut off from the economic melting pot of the Mediterranean and Middle East, so it meant that economic and social evolution failed to happen.\nThese Australian and North American tribes remained completely intact until European settlers revolutionised their ‘reality’ and changed their society by changing their economy. These tribes went from simple hunting and gathering to overt control based on the top down authority of the imported Christian church and British and Dutch monarchy. Even today some individuals have not adjusted to this cultural change of pace and like many people in the twenty-first century, are culturally conflicted or confused.\nTry and imagine being part of a tribe in the Middle East or Mediterranean as it evolved between 5000 to 500 BC. Life was harsh with continual fighting for resources between tribes, but generally within the tribe itself, things were harmonious. Everyone had a role and values were simple even though practices like child marriage, cruelty or banishment of those who broke ‘tribal custom’ may have been normal.\nThere would be little rule breaking as people would have been socialised to conform by repetition of rules. You can still see the repetition of rules practised in certain communities today. Think about a person’s reality if they live in the western world having migrated here from non-western communities where ‘traditional’ values are still important. They may have to come to terms with rules or behaviour, some of which might be incompatible with their own culture of origin.\nImagine what tribal communities would make of western culture; our freedom, absence of different roles based on our sex as well as our different sexual lifestyles, our apparent lack of care for the elderly and our unregulated sexual behaviour. Our modern lives may be classed as immoral. Tribes had to have all these things under some sort of control. There was no choice.\nThose with a desire to maintain simple faith-based or tribal values and practices may struggle to adapt to the modern free market and reject our twenty-first-century values. This has led some liberal-minded western people to play down the impact of traditional cultural practices on those from non-western backgrounds even when those practices conflict with western values of free choice and consent. This ‘liberal’ approach promotes the interests of certain groups instead of the individuals within those groups.\nMany modern westernised people would find it hard in a strict tribal society. For the modern westerner, our reality is based on personal and economic freedom underpinned by our experience of the free market. Today we desire individual choice!\nCultural ‘conflict’ therefore is caused by lived realities being based on different sets of economic and social expectations. Globalisation is responsible, but western governments are to blame for the problems this causes. They do this by failing to promote the rights of individuals in the face of demands for collective rights, which may discriminate against groups, for example women. The demand by some groups to protect religious practice is one such example where individual and collective rights conflict.\nIt isn’t possible to adopt, promote or impose one simple set of moral rules and maintain personal choice. The contradiction for militant Islamists is that whereas tribal values were coherent with the economics of tribal society militant Islamists want to impose simple religious values on non-tribal twenty-first-century societies….by force.\nIn box\nOnce we all lived in tribes and accepted simple tribal values. There was economic equality within tribal communities but different roles for men and women. Today conflict comes if different sets of values based on different economic expectations clash.\nChapter two\nHumanities first Revolution. Political power becomes normal as kings take control.\nIn the Middle East, around six thousand years ago, tribal society started to change due to technological improvements. These improvements created the first agricultural revolution and gave rise to power by a minority over the many, political power! This helped create the Middle Eastern faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. All these faiths tried to deal with the unfairness of political power by turning simple values into a set of ‘moral’ behaviours for all people.\n‘Top-down’ control (which is like feudalism, as well as other systems of top-down authority) came about because people were able to organise the economy so that surplus food was available (a bit like a profit). To begin with, it was not a money surplus, but as people created more food than was needed, it became possible to trade and eventually money and wealth became possible. Inequality was born! A few people who did not work themselves could acquire wealth from the work of others.\nAs a result, ‘immoral’ behaviours like prostitution and adultery became possible. These would be activities almost impossible in tribal society but with surplus food production, people were more than able to support women (or men) who provided sex. It was also possible for rich men to support ‘their’ women, so some women did not have to work as they had to do in tribes. Patriarchal society was born, and the control of women in society began.\nIn its latter stages this period was an era when art and beautiful artefacts could be created by artisans, who were paid to create beauty rather than to hunt for food.\nThis economic revolution obviously changed peoples lived realities. The Old and New Testament of the Jewish and Christian faith and the Qur’an plus other religious views expressed by the prophet Muhammad are all about trying to re-establish a virtuous society during this period of economic upheaval.\nOver thousands of years, where surplus value was created the bonds of tribal society were permanently broken, allowing a minority of people, an elite, to take the surplus value from working people and slaves and make it their own. They used this economic advantage to create and maintain power structures, so they could dominate and control ordinary people. Once this authoritarian system was established, life would never be the same again for billions of ordinary people.\nCan you imagine how the Reality of the majority was affected by this significant economic and social change? People had lost tribal loyalty, tribal equality and predictability and were now subject to authority from elite minorities. For ordinary people, life was a complex mix of submission to various authorities, observance of religious rules and working hard to create property and wealth for others.\nAuthoritarian societies were thus considered by many to be very bad indeed. With economies in the hands of greedy kings, this era became humanities ‘nation building’. It started in the Mediterranean and Middle East with the earliest power based authoritarian systems in Egypt and Iraq. These authoritarian systems existed when other people, even in the same area of the world were still living in simple tribal society.\nThe ‘top-down’ model created by feudalism and similar authoritarian systems was very efficient and is still used today in politics and public service and public administration. People at the top of organisations and their ‘leadership teams’ make ‘decisions’ and as a result, earn more than the people creating the value whether it be an economic surplus value (profit) or social value (e.g. caring for society). It is not the nature of the activity that is the problem but the difference in reward which should as in tribal society be proportionate to the overall needs of society and its ability to pay.\nGrowing feudal and authoritarian societies encouraged further economic and social development because they allowed risk. They gave the power to change society and takes risks, to a king (or in some nations a queen) and abolished permanent tribal rules imposed and upheld collectively. The creation of economic surplus set humanity on the march towards modern politics and modern society but also created the inequality we still experience today.\nEarly and successful Middle East authoritarian systems were conquered by Islam. Some of these then adopted and developed mainly Greek science and other modern ideas of the day.\nWhilst Islam in the Middle East was able to conquer authoritarian systems, these sorts of economic systems were eventually willing to accommodate Christianity too.\nWith Christianity, authoritarian systems such as feudalism adopted a religion which was unconcerned with earthly power and so accepted the idea of inequality on earth. Whilst Islamic authoritarian societies were forced to accept economic inequality, within Islam itself economic inequality was haram or wrong. For some devout Muslims today, this remains a major cultural rubbing point with western economies and some Muslim states like Saudi Arabia. In Islamic law there are strict rules about profit and fairness.\nLike everywhere else in Europe, and parts of the Middle East, Britain was finally wealthy enough to develop feudalism after the Romans left in the fifth century. It became fully established after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Its decline began after the Black Death in the fourteenth century when a shortage of labour forced wages up and drove economic innovation.\nIn Box\nFeudalism was the theft of resources from the many by a small elite who set up power structures to maintain their authority. The ‘right’ to do this was at odds with tribal values but elite politics won the day. Britain developed feudalism after the Romans left in the fifth century.\nChapter three\nNothing lasts forever. Feudalisms decline and the rise of capitalists power. The action moves to Europe.\nIn Europe Feudalism endured for centuries and in various forms it still exists today in parts of the world that are not yet industrial but are no longer tribal. Its main characteristic is still its top-down, unaccountable authoritarianism.\nIn Britain we consider ourselves beyond feudalism, but traces of it appear in ceremonial form in ours and many other modern European States. These states maintain power based on status/property/income and have as a ‘democracy’ a system based on the representation of the people by an elected as opposed to hereditary elite. This is promoted by politicians and generally accepted by the people as the acceptable antidote to past unaccountable feudal power and authoritarianism.\nBritain remains in some senses feudal with democracy grafted on, because we now elect and pay our elite. We are still subject to their rules and decisions, however much we disagree with them. Disagreement between the people and our elected elite seems to be getting more common as they no longer seem to ‘represent’ the people who pay them. Us!\nIn Britain, feudalism’s decline began due to increasing levels of prosperity generated by education, science, further agricultural advances, and the work of an intelligent emerging ‘middle class’. This change began to develop after the ravages of the Black Death in the fourteenth century when labour was in short supply and wages were going up.\nThe earliest challenge to the British feudal system came about because ordinary working people were trading and by their combined efforts and expertise were creating greater wealth than had been previously possible. The feudal aristocracy who ‘owned’ all wealth were, therefore, getting rich at the expense of ordinary hard-working people. The aristocracy was also wasting wealth on wars and personal vanity.\nKings who at one time broke society away from predictable tribal society were no longer promoting economic and social evolution but were holding back changes demanded by a working middle class who were not benefitting politically from their skill and enterprise.\nThis middle class made up of innovators, merchants and hard-working ‘entrepreneurs’ was getting restless, angry and their workforce hungry. There were riots in England from the fourteenth century onwards due to food shortages and abuses of feudal power.\nIn Germany, ideas were developing based on religious scripture that supported a new economic model based on hard work that challenged the idea that the church was entitled to the economic wealth created by ordinary people. These ideas also challenged the role of the church in supporting the poor.\nAs with the change from tribal society to top-down authoritarian power like feudalism, the reality of different groups of people was again coming into conflict. This gave rise to revolution. The final stage of this economic revolution began in Britain in the seventeenth century, France in the eighteenth century and wider Europe in the nineteenth century and Russia and China in the twentieth century.\nThese revolutions put capitalist ideas into what had become declining feudal societies. These revolutions broke the power of those born to rule and replaced it with power based on the economic or political interests of a new elite. The elites were landowners and capitalists and their group interests became political Parties. Much later ‘workers’ gained their own parties too.\nBy freeing people from feudalism and reforming religion so people had to work hard for wages or make a profit rather than live on ‘welfare’ from the Church, capitalism promoted the world of the economic rather than the religious or feudal elite. Capitalism like feudalism still relied on surplus value being created, but under capitalism it was created by workers free to contract with capitalists for work. The surplus value was then acquired by capitalists in the form of profit. To succeed as an economic model capitalism needed people to be free to think, speak, innovate and trade. The legal principles of contract, choice and consent were the basis of capitalist economics, not as had been the case under feudalism: compulsion, coercion and control.\nCapitalisms values of contract, choice and consent have been and continue to be liberating for working people, which is something that many left-wing politicians struggled to accept. Before capitalism, as we have seen, the aristocracy controlled the nation’s wealth. It was revolutions that had to be used to dislodge them.\nIn Russia and China, one form of feudalism with kings was replaced by revolutionary socialism: a system based on control of the economy by one political party that believed it represent the working class. Any one-party state is called totalitarian. Revolutionary Russia and China therefore did not become capitalist instead they fused their one-party political system with industrialisation. This undermined the workers who, whilst still creating surplus value (as in capitalism proper), were subordinate to the one-party state.\nAll ‘modern’ political systems all over the world including within western democracy promote the importance of the political party, but in ‘democracy’ there is a choice of parties to support.\nIn the west, capitalism did liberate innovators, workers and people of science from what had become the menace of the European feudal system. Once the scientist and innovators had ‘industrialised’ there was no holding back this engine of economic and social progress. A combination of people and machines created more surplus value than the world had ever known.\nThe British Empire was financed by capitalism. Like all empires, it had many moral failings. Eventually it was based on trade, freedom within the law and the accumulation of capital (surplus value turned into property, wealth and bankable money). Whilst based on trade, it was still skewed in favour of the capitalist economic elite. By the eighteenth century, it was fully exploitative of the nations it had conquered but to function properly it was able to leave a legacy in some ex colonies of contract, choice and consent and British common law.\nSocieties that could not innovate within the capitalist model due to religious observance, for example, created growing poverty for their subject peoples. As a result, Islam’s Eastern empire had disappeared by 1928. Islam is now re-emerging as a moral force across the globe funded by Saudi oil money.\nWhilst capitalism as a system did not discriminate, it impacted harder on poorer, predominantly black or religious majority nations who have historically been unable to build up the capital or wealth necessary to be part of the capitalist system. Today many poor countries have authoritarian heads of State who don’t believe in liberating their people using freedom based on contract, choice and consent.\nBy creating so much wealth industrial capitalism was widely viewed as a force for prosperity and liberation, particularly for those middle-class owners of capital who maintained the system. They disguised its unfairness with religion, parliamentary democracy and the law. This is what is known as right-wing thinking; promoting the interests of capitalism.\nHowever, capitalism was experienced as very unfair by the workers or as they were called then the ‘working class’ They knew they worked hard to create the surplus value necessary to make others very wealthy.\nFrom the nineteenth century onwards, within western democracies industrial capitalism reigned supreme until the turn of the twentieth century. But industrial capitalism was a system that had in built ‘contradictions’ such as too few winners and too many losers, so over time legislation and taxation had to be used to minimise the bad impact of capitalism on the working class.\nCapitalists wealth came and went often within families and usually over several generations and when capitalists failed the capitalist system took workers down too, leading to unemployment.\nWhilst capitalism might have been ‘just’ because anyone, man or woman of any ethnic background could in theory become a capitalist by employing workers and accumulating wealth, it was unfair because it exploited the workers (exploited means making them work harder for their wages, so they created surplus value or profit for the capitalist). The unfairness of the capitalist system created ‘left wing’ thinking.\nIn Box\nCapitalism took over old feudal systems and created a form of democracy that promoted the interests of its wealthy capitalist elite. Workers were ‘free’ but had to contract for employment and were exploited by capitalists. The unfairness of this economic arrangement gave rise to left wing political ideas.\nChapter Four\nChange again: Socialism. The rise of the left wing political elite.\nSo, in summary by the late nineteenth century, the UK, USA and Europe were capitalist countries, using representative ‘democracy’ to legitimise the capitalist systems so called ‘exploitation’ of workers.\nIt is at this point we meet socialism for the first time. There exist two kinds of socialism. Democratic socialism is not to be confused with revolutionary or single party-based socialism (like early twentieth century Soviet Russia, China or Nazi Germany).\nWhilst capitalism was based on contract and choice e.g. a worker had ‘choice’ of who to work for, it also meant working people toiled on low wages and in poor conditions to make a few people rich. The rich were rich because they employed millions of people and took the surplus value those people created banking it as their own.\nAs workers became more educated and organised (both expected within a ‘progressive’ capitalist system) they began to see the unfairness in what was happening and how the whole religious, political and legal system justified their exploitation, holding them back economically.\nLeft wing socialist ideas started to be promoted by an educated working and politically ambitious ‘middle class’. At first, they demanded capitalist industrialisation should be destroyed by violent revolution and replaced with socialist industrialisation. This was revolutionary socialism. It took hold as we have seen only in places like twentieth century Russia, China and North Korea\nConcerned about possible revolution, democratic governments who wanted to improve capitalism used taxation to support those who fell out of the system and into unemployment. They also restricted the capitalist’s ability to take advantage of their workers.\nIn the free western world, over time, governments improved workers conditions and introduced clean air, education, housing and employment rights. Much of this is what revolutionary socialists had demanded. Similarly, rights like the right to vote or stand for parliament, rights that only capitalists enjoyed in the eighteenth century were extended to more and more people. It started with working-class men in the nineteenth century and then women in the twentieth.\nThis use of laws to support workers was the beginning of socialist ideas. Most would agree that this was the elite doing good. Revolutionary socialists disagreed they wanted economies taken over and run by socialist parties.\nIn the early twentieth century Russia and China experienced the revolutionary socialist elite taking control of the economy. For many decades after World War Two, this form of socialist state industrialisation became a political-bogeyman which western leaders called ‘communism’.\nFor working people in so called communist countries, the reality of industrial work was little different from the west. But with more freedom and innovation the west was more profitable and could offer a better lifestyle to its workers than communism, particularly in the USA.\nAll economic systems apart from tribal ones, need surplus value/profit to invest in maintaining the economy/society. Revolutionary socialist Russia never created enough surplus value/profit to pay for its bloated industrially inefficient state. Russia’s socialist experiment ended in the 1980’s. Arguably the EU is a similar bloated system today.\nFrom the end of the second world war British capitalism was viewed as an economic model that had too many problems such as poverty amongst the working class, to be allowed to continue without some state involvement. Various means of re distributing wealth were introduced by the post war democratic Labour Party. These ranged from public ownership of some industries like Coal mining, Ship building and Railways (Nationalisation) to tax changes that put a high burden on the rich.\nThe welfare state and National Health Service also came into existence. It was also seen as desirable to control the economy by pumping in money when it began to stop employing people because demand for what they had produced was low and they were unemployed.\nWith a growing need for so much state control, the elite became ‘experts’ trained to manage the economy and society. The elite were now just as likely to be state employees like civil servants as capitalists. The term used at this time was the ‘mixed economy’. It was capitalism controlled by socialist ideas.\nIn Box\nCapitalism was unfair to workers so ‘socialist’ ideas developed in Britain. After the second world war ‘democratic socialism’ regulated Britain’s economy. The idea behind democratic socialism is to take wealth off capitalists, wealth which workers have created and spend it on state provision like health care or welfare.\nChapter Five\nGovernment ‘experts’ and politicians become the new elite. Debt to the rescue!\nThe changes introduced by the socialist British Labour government after the Second World War led to a period of sustained prosperity. Inefficiency set in from about 1970 onwards. At this point the tax payer began paying for the nationalised industries that could not pay for themselves.\nBecause of changes in the global economy that have taken place since the 1980s capitalism in the west has had to evolve into what we now call the ‘free market’.\nA free market is exactly what it says it is. Anyone can, in theory, become a producer or consumer. A process helped by the internet with ‘You Tubers’ making millions in sponsorship. People can produce almost anything and consume almost anything.\nThe free market relies on economic relationships which are negotiated by a global economic elite who, depending on how you see the free market, have either a monopoly over how this free market works or have no control over it what so ever. Those who influence the free market are amongst others the Multi-National companies, tech giants as well as national governments including the EU and global trade organisations.\nThe free market, unlike eighteen and nineteenth-century capitalism, is not concerned with personal morality it only needs ‘consumers’ with enough income to buy products. So, thanks to the free market’s need to have consumers, ‘lifestyles’ previously discriminated against by religious or cultural prejudice can be accommodated by economic freedom and the acceptance, for the time being, of the western political elite.\nTo enhance consumer choice some western businesses have sent their production to developing countries to save money on worker’s wages and thus maximise profit on their popular retail brands. This makes people in a few companies very rich but reduces the number of wage earners and taxpayers employed in the west.\nBecause of the way the free market operates it is seen by many as not just unfair but immoral. The free market is not capitalism. It is not an economic system based on a set of unfair but coherent economic principles reinforced by religion, politics and the law. It is essentially a global economic free-for-all. A religion of personal self-interest, desire and choice.\nThe free market has progressed around the world spreading the same values that gave rise to freedom in Britain, the United States and Europe, but in these economies its wealth-creating capacity has become weaker. So, to support its profitability money must be pumped into the economy by governments. Money based on debt and taxation.\nTo complicate things further, profit made by big western corporations is often taxed ‘offshore’ and therefore doesn’t contribute taxation to help pay for state the state bureaucracy we have inherited since the second world war. The government must therefore borrow money to pay for the services it provides. Services which many of us use.\nThe result is that powerful western elites and their parliaments, political systems and bureaucracies who in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries would have been paid for by capitalisms tax payments are now relying ordinary workers to pay for them via income tax and indebtedness. Workers are therefore sacrificing their power to consume, to pay for the state and government.\nAs we have said the ‘free market’ is a consumer market, therefore, the next revolution has its basis in spending power. It’s here we find the free market’s major problem. Expensive western governments reduce the ability of workers to consume. But to remain ‘free’ with values promoting personal freedom under pinning it, the free market needs consumers.\nNew consumers are also needed beyond the economically troubled European and American economies. Brexit should be about creating a greater global economic fairness by spreading consumer equality via spending power beyond the so called ‘rich’ but indebted nations of the west.\nIn addition to tax reducing consumer spending, consumer spending is worsened because the big corporations sit on mountains of profit and don’t put it back into the world economy as ‘spending power’ via wages. This economic model is unsustainable.\nIn Box\nWhat was left of capitalism finally stopped working in the 1980’s. It became the market financed by debt and managed by global experts. It needs consumers, but governments take money from consumers. The global elite are making us pay for them and this limits our consumer spending. The free market protects our rights but is now debt dependent.\nChapter Six\nWhat future the free market as the elite go global. Power for the few, debt for the many.\nGovernments need money just as individuals do and the money needed is no longer available through the profitability of western capitalism. Today our state with its big employment bill relies on debt and tax to pay its way on our behalf.\nNo one questions the need for state employment (Dr’s, nurses, social workers, police etc) but the cost of paying the elite that manages them is no longer justified due to the nation’s lack of profitability and reliance on debt.\nIf free of the burden of too much government debt and tax the ordinary worker can become a more effective consumer, spending more of what they earn to enable other workers to be employed locally in businesses, shops, coffee houses and bars or in caring for their local community at large.\nAbove a certain wage level, payments do not add directly to local consumer spending but end up in the global economy. The power base of our wealthy political and economic elite.\nTo add to consumers woes much of our private debt which we are encouraged to take out to help with consumer demand, needs to be underpinned by some form of value. This value comes from land or property. In the case of land, an increase in land value works its way through the financial system as people raise money by mortgages. This gives us a contribution to national income based on asset value-based debt. This is what led to the 2007-2008 banking crisis when loans to customers were backed by land values and land values went down.\nBy basing much of a nation’s ability to pay its way on debt we are slowly gobbling up our food production capacity by selling land for debt backed development etc. This model provides well-paid work to service sector employees like bankers/lawyers/estate agents and land managers. It also provides taxation on profits for the state. Big corporations benefit too as tax income plus government debt pays for contracts to do work in NHS/defence/education and criminal justice or indeed build roads. All political parties in the UK must uncritically endorse this value backed debt model. What is the alternative?\nMore seriously, with all our debt we are slowly eroding the long-term viability of our planet as we in the west over consume its natural resources. The debt based free market system is damaging the planet to a far greater extent than any system before it. However, it has extended people’s rights and ended illegitimate abuse of those held back economically by low status or discrimination under earlier capitalist, feudal/authoritarian and tribal systems. As a culture our attitude to the free market is therefore ambiguous.\nSome people believe the moral confusion of the free market requires a return to ‘faith’, Christian or Islamic. Others believe in taking whole national economies under government control.\nA modern free market economy only works when people have almost complete economic freedom without fear or sanction. With state ownership, we might have jobs, but we give our economic freedom to the state and compromise our right to contract, choose and consent as we, rather than the state sees fit.\nTo see the impact of religion on a society look at Iran or Saudi Arabia. People crying out for the economic and social equality offered by the free-market, particularly women and the gay community. Lack of freedom affects prosperity and peoples happiness. It causes anger by supressing freedom and makes states oppressive.\nReligion and traditional democratic socialism, therefore, fail the freedom for the worker test. They are solutions to a looming economic and ecological crisis that simply can’t reflect the expectations of a modern workforce enjoying lives based on choice, consent, freedom and limited democracy.\nBlue Revolution is based on what is called ‘economic determinism’ or economic reality. In other words, the reality of working people. What working people experience should be instinctively more important than the views of people at the ‘top’ with their unconscious ‘global’ self-interest.\nIdeas to improve society must come from the economic experience of working people and not from various political party conferences where policy is created by party members (a tiny minority of the people) then imposed on society (all the people) when parties get into government.\nTo preserve freedom ordinary people must now set the political and economic agenda just as the middle-class capitalist did in the eighteenth century. Political parties products of the eighteenth century have no significant role in influencing this process.\nPeople should take more control in politics because having fought for the right to choose and consent and having gained our freedom and our limited democracy, it now seems like political parties and a global elite both paid for by our debt and taxes are taking our rights away and imposing their ‘global ideology’ on us. An ideology that accepts the abuse of people elsewhere in the world whilst undermining western national identities and the hard fought for rights that go with those national identities.\nIn Britain we need to reform our political system so for the first time ever it becomes a system that protects western values and our belief in the principles of choice and consent, freedom and democracy. Working western people would preserve and extend these rights to all the world’s working people. Every other class or powerful group restricts them as they always have done to preserve their power.\nLook around you, most people you see would support all your freedoms unquestioningly as you would support theirs.\nIn Box\nThe free market creates our rights to choose and consent, but it relies on an economy which is dependent on debt. We need to preserve our free market to ensure we preserve our rights as working people because in much of the world people have few rights. If the debt dependent free market disappears our rights will go with it.\nChapter seven\nAnd finally, people power? Another Revolution where the people replace the elite!\nWe have been through this brief history of wealth and public power otherwise known as politics, explaining how working people have created wealth but have not held the power that wealth should grant. In the twentieth century the left wing had believed it was working in the interests of the people but once they had the power of the ‘state’ behind them they undermined economic rights with policies which increase the expense of the state, at a direct financial/social cost to the taxpayer.\nGovernments need to recognise that far from being an asset to the British economy, they are a pitiful hinderance to it by taking too much money in tax to pay for bits of their system that we no longer need, like their hierarchy and power structures in politics and in the public sector.\nState costs reduce peoples spending power. Spending power is needed to preserve our free market economy and therefore our choice-based lifestyle.\nSo, what can we the nation’s working people do today to protect ourselves? Ordinary working people did not bring down feudalism (it was the capitalists that did that) and we did not bring down capitalism (it has been saved by corporate global economics and as the free market it is financed and threatened by debt). The next revolution is our revolution and we can’t afford to mess it up. Yet most people don’t even realise a revolution is needed.\nSome things to consider\nFirstly, Blue Revolution doesn’t need to have all the answers. We do not want to be like a political party promoting policy and selecting candidates in-house. We are simply a political ‘Brand’ anyone can use should they wish to.\nWe suggest that political policy must not be developed and implemented by a party elite. The most grotesque examples might be the Blair/Bush war on Iraq or the creeping power-based unification of the EU, but there are lots more examples besides, like the creation of the police and crime commissioners or The High-Speed Rail link (HS2) These policies never had the peoples approval.\nUnder our eighteenth-century parliaments political policies generally have nothing to do with the views of real working people. We, therefore, need to change the political system to make working people’s views more relevant. We need to stop our elite 650 British MP’s using their party’s membership to manipulate democracy in favour of their special interests, be those interests bankers, house builders, Trades Union Barons or militant identity groups.\nBlue Revolution believes the only solution is to extend to the lowest legitimate political level, for example to parish councils, the power to contribute to debate and vote on national policy. Voting using technology would be very quick. A debate would be more interesting too, with a level of engagement that would be massive. It would be set up to ensure that where necessary every contributor had knowledge of their subject.\nThe effect would be that the elite Westminster bubble would burst because a parish councillor may advance the best challenge to an idea from a remote village in some-where-shire. The government would still be drawn from the largest group in Westminster but the people who debate their proposals and vote would come from a group of people considerably larger than the current 650 ‘handpicked’ party political MP’s.\nThe role of religion needs to be addressed too as traditional moral views are being promoted within a newly confident Islam. This poses a risk to equality in a way not seen since the seventeenth century. Religion has always been used by elites or those who would like to become elites. It does their mind controlling for them by promoting ‘spiritual’ compliance within the elite sanctioned faith.\nTo deal with ancient moral systems we need to dismantle all state authorised religious teaching and recognise faith as a personal choice that reflects a person’s spirituality but does not extend beyond that into the realm of politics or public life. Religion takes advantage of peoples innate spirituality and turns it into something that supports a political ideology. There should be no obligation on the nation or her people to accept any religion.\nToday we see the consequences of religious morality as it violates twenty-first-century human rights, rights extended over centuries by progressive economic and social development in the west. This fact is lost on our culturally illiterate European elite who protect all religion, irrespective of that religion’s commitment to preserving the rights of the individual.\nIn addition to managing religious influence maybe working people should not have their opinions ‘informed’ by an over promoted media elite working to maintain a failing party based parliamentary political system.\nThe news department of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) should avoid bias and become a limited ‘public service’ news department paid for as now by taxation or licence fee, but which provides fact-based news or the attributable opinion of a wide variety of informed people. This would mean that the BBC or its employees would not be allowed to express their own opinions on air.\nWith News coverage based on facts and the shared reality of working people, workers could shape policy and make politics truly dynamic operating in the interests of the economy and working people and not the state or any elite.\nFinally, unless change takes place the western economy will in the words of Karl Marx collapse under the weight of its economic contradictions. Today the most troubling contradiction is western government debt being used to enable consumers to buy goods made abroad. This does not generate sustainability for western workers or the free market system upon which people’s rights are dependent.\nReliance on this system will bankrupt the government first and then, the nation itself. Moreover, western companies like Amazon diminish jobs in retail and sit on a mountain of profit which doesn’t become via wages, more consumer spending. You can’t run an economy on this basis. It will eventually collapse. And then what? Religious authoritarianism, political totalitarianism, both?\nPlease support a Blue Revolution simply by thinking aloud and differently about your life and your needs. Think about your values and where your values and ideas come from and how you could become more outspoken to protect those values from the many challenges faced by working people in the twenty-first century.\nIf you want to you can donate even a very small amount to our group by going on our website ABlueRevoluton.Org.\nBetter still stand as an independently thinking and voting candidate for the independent brand Blue Revolution (read our website for details of how). You are totally free to promote your own political beliefs with Blue Revolution. We are not like other parties we have no bureaucracy and simply endorse you as a candidate if you share our values. You will be the people’s choice!\nAlternatively, just contribute to the debate in your own way.\nRemember peoples personal freedom is shaped by their economic and social life experiences and these are now under threat because we have a near-bankrupt western free market. We need to start the discussion. We can’t trust the elite anymore……if we ever could.\nThank you for reading.",

With walk on parts for God.\nHere at Blue Revolution, we argue that all ideas including religious ones are shaped by economic reality rather than being plucked from the air by prophets or soothsayers. Look at any society at any time in history and there will be patterns and rituals linked to the ‘economic circumstances’ of that society be it a tribal, feudal or a capitalist society. These economic circumstances are formed either by levels of scientific ignorance or scientific discovery and how this influences the way economic value or wealth is created as well as who gets to control that wealth. Essentially all this forms a prevailing ‘ideology’ a belief system if you like, with numerous ideological ‘pretenders’ to challenge it, some more or less credible than others. Socialism has been a challenger to capitalism just as Christianity tried to challenge the world of the first century in the Middle East.\nMuch is made by Christians of the role of Christianity in creating capitalism. This seems at odds with our ‘economic determinism’ as Christianity should be a product of economic circumstances not the originator of them. The Christian message was certainly unusual in the first century but it was utopian and in no sense capable of replacing either the barbarism of the warring tribes from Abraham in the Old Testament to Muhammad and jihad in the seventh century nor the feudalism stirring into life during the same period. Christianity, however, could not have happened had there not been an increase in available wealth to be distributed fairly as described by Christ, or unfairly as happened under feudalism. Christianity was a post-tribal ideology like feudalism but one so passive as to be overwhelmed by barbarism when barbarism resurfaced with Muhammad and jihad in the seventh century.\nThe problem for Christianity was that wealth and the desire to gain control of it created an aggressive patriarchal feudal system. The parable of the loaves and fishes and Christ’s invocation to “render unto Caesar that which is Caesars, render unto God that which is God’s” was not a credible economic ideology given feudalisms economic impulse to control from the top. But along with ‘love thy neighbour’ and ‘turn the other cheek’ Christianity did create an ideology of peace that allowed stability within a warring and fractious region, consolidating feudalism. This Christian inspired passivity allowed for the separation of religion from the economy and State. Which in turn led to prosperity. This prosperity only lasted for about seven hundred years though. It ended with the advance of Islam.\nWithin seven hundred years Islam would by force of arms take the Middle East from relative stability to wars based on banditry, domination and forced conversion to Islam in the name of Allah and all at the point of the sword; jihad. Being an ideology of warfare and enforced submission, Islam’s glorious age only came with its conquest of feudal dominions in the Middle East, all pretty much concluded by the middle ages. This ideology of war and conquest secured the Middle East for the Muslim world and rendered the Jews and Christians second-class citizens in what had once been their prosperous homelands.\nSensing the extinction of Christendom in the late 11th Century Pope Urban sanctioned the Crusades. The Crusades, therefore, were not offensive wars they were defensive wars, an attempt to protect feudal Christendom which had surrendered to Islam’s ideology of warfare and banditry. The crusades failed spectacularly to protect Christendom from Islam.\nThe early economic success of a Christian Middle East fuelled Islamic expansionism. Islam would not have gained any headway had not the economic strength in the region stimulated the Arab tribes to unite under one leader worshipping one God and embark on an ideologically driven programme very much at odds with what had become the relative stability of early feudal ‘Christendom’.\nSo, putting Christianity, the crusades and Islam in an economic context, one needs to see religion as no more than ideology driven by economics with, in the case of Islam, a ‘God’ sanctifying greed and brutality. Whether an ideology takes off as Islam was able to do and Christianity largely failed to do in the Middle East between the seventh and nineteenth centuries, depends upon whether it reflects the economic needs that relate to that time. Christianity being a passive faith derided by Adolf Hitler for its weakness, allowed feudalism to evolve but likewise was powerless to stop Islamic expansionism.\nHaving secured various successful feudal kingdoms and dominions Islam’s doctrinal obsessions saw the end of progressive social and economic evolution in the Middle East. Indeed, such is the capricious notion of the Islamic God that everything ‘evolutionary’ or progressive is a blasphemy, essentially stopping economic development in its tracks. Islam having appropriated feudalism continues to operate this socio-economic model today having nowhere in the world progressed anywhere near democracy. Feudalism in the twenty-first century is politically about as advanced as Islam can become, given its doctrinal demand for control, compulsion and submission. This can be seen in Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nWith Christianity routed in the Middle East, it fared better in Europe where arguably the climate didn’t suit the Islamic warriors and there was little in the way of booty after the retreat of the Romans. Continuing with its ideology of ‘turn the other cheek’ Christianity contributed to the economic success of the western world because, just as it yielded to early feudalism, it was flexible enough to ‘turn the other cheek’ when the juggernaut of scientific discovery and rationality (the Enlightenment) fired up capitalisms engines in the 17th century. By being benign and allowing the economy and State to evolve independently of faith, it allowed progressive social and economic development\nChristianity, therefore, facilitated economic and social progress, unlike Islam it didn’t stop it in its tracks and whilst always two steps behind capitalism (as we would expect as economic determinists) in terms of driving equality, Christianity allowed capitalism to deliver the economic rights to contract, choose and consent that emerged from the Protestant work ethic and become mass industrialisation and then in the twentieth century ‘social justice’. Capitalism has in the subsequent three centuries liberated people within all the nations of the free world. Whilst Christianity has all but faded away. However, just like Christianity in the first century, capitalism is now weak and complacent and has out of cultural ignorance, given the green light to Islamic expansionism. Where this will lead us ‘god’ only knows.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_a-21st-century-state-of-the-nations-by-blue-revolution-with-a-post-industrial-neo-marxian-twist/content_225.html": "A 21st Century “State of the Nation(s)” by Blue Revolution….with a post-industrial neo Marxian twist\nIn the western world, we have a problem. What we love is destroying us and the planet. We no longer love each other we can only see each other as “opportunities” or “opportunity costs” essentially economic terms that have nothing to do with love and we see the same in everything else too.\nThis has happened because our real love is consumption of the world’s resources and to some extent consumption of each other. In the post-industrial West, we have to borrow to sustain our consumption. The incompetent activities of governments and banks since the 1970’s and governments in the UK specifically since the 1960’s have fuelled a regrettable debt binge to fuel consumption and maintain “jobs” and the domestic economic system.\nIgnoring the complex world of gold standards and financial regulation, we will concentrate on the bigger picture for the benefit of the less economically inclined.\nFirst some context. By the 1960/70’s it was clear that in “capitalist” countries the inherent “contradictions of capitalism”, (basically it over produces goods and undermines both the value of them and the ability to pay living wages to make them or buy them) were leading to poverty and crime. New “industries” like illegal drugs, porn and prostitution started to replace the traditional industries that were the envy of the world only twenty years earlier. This was the case on both sides of the Atlantic. Of course, governments could employ people; in the forces say but this was paid for out of tax from a declining tax base. The western world was getting poorer, it was a crisis and it was the Cold War… Cripes! There had to be a way to re-engineer the system so it could pay for itself again.\nThere was no way an economy built on taxing profit and increasing levels of income could adapt to this crisis….essentially it was existential. The only possible solution for governments back then was to introduce public ownership of industries, but the 1940’s British experiment was clearly a failure due to “industrial hierarchy” (more of this later) continuing to alienate workers even when in theory they “owned the means of production”.\nIn the US there was no appetite to go down the “socialist” UK model. Jobs were being exported (a process that sped up over the next two decades)and communities were thrown onto the dole or as we call it “the global labour market” but takers for their expensive labour there came none. The careful balancing of the state’s books became difficult as the tax base shrank and the welfare burden increased. Bruce Springsteen made a career out of singing about these “global unemployed” and Ronald Regan couldn’t balance a budget!\nIn the UK whether by accident or design Margaret Thatcher adopted “Thatcherism” a combination of free-market economics and fiscal conservatism. Just as no one could fathom out, back in the day, why Regan made such as a hash of his last budget no one could work out the success of Thatcherism. Factories, mines and shipyards closed but still, the economy carried on apparently “growing”. In the US after Regan, Bush then Clinton reaped the “rewards” of the same phenomenon.\nBack in the UK selling Council homes in deprived areas opened up new avenues for “business” in the finance sector and coincidentally as the North Eastern mines, steel plants and shipyards closed so the Malls sprang up. They sold everything from lingerie to furniture now almost all made in China at very low unit cost but sold at prices comparable to British produced products. Profit margins were healthy for stores “commissioning” these products.\nForeign production costs, borrowing against inflating property prices, including discounted ex-council stock, stocks and shares, and the payment of state salaries and investment with “regeneration budgets” (building new housing and Malls) kept the whole economic show on the road and has done for decades. The whole thing was allowed to simmer rather than boil with Private Finance Initiatives and other means of embedding taxpayers money into the profit margins of corporations no longer able to cut it on the world stage without reliance on the state. To cut costs Governments acting as always in the interests of the “State” rather than the “Nation” swooned into the arms of the financial racketeers. John McDonnell promises the same solution again on an even grander scale to pay for renationalisation.\nThatcher, Major, Blair and Cameron were all symbols of this model which was presented by crony economists and bankers, the City or Wall Street as an anti boom and bust perpetual money machine. However, it could never be that. Only deluded politicians like Blair and Cameron in the UK or Clinton in the US thought this was their passport to immortality. Everyone else from 2003 onwards…us included, held our breath waiting for the collapse. Eventually, it came in 2007/2008.\nThe only solution was to bail out the banks. Other fanciful options could not have worked as the banking sector was central to the whole national ecosystem. If the banks failed in their death throws they would have consumed not only the economy but society as well. So like the six foot tall 20 stone teenage son they had to be indulged with bail out’s and a mass of Quantitative Easing. In an open world, this has done little to rebuild real economies but it has made bankers and asset owners very rich. An unintended consequence? Perhaps less “unintended” than we might think.\nSo working on this analysis having some passable link to the actualete’, western “capitalism” ended in the mid-1980’s when China provided the worlds proletarians to produce cheap goods for a greedy western free market. The west became a free market of racketeers and chancers buoyed up on its own arrogance and incapable of seeing that it’s so-called “wealth” was simply debt based or tax derived, of little or no actual “value”. But for those to whom it flowed it has made life very agreeable whilst making governments fearful of their electorate and the electorate smelling a rat somewhere hostile to their governments.\nNow we referred to “industrial hierarchy” above when talking about Nationalisations in the past. Nothing better illustrates the problem of the “State” now, than the phrase “Industrial Hierarchy”. The State is not the Nation and some parts of the state work better than others, for example, the Constitutional Monarchy works well in the UK. The UK Parliament itself, however, is a shocking bourgeois throwback to the 18th Century which is no longer capable of delivering long-term prosperity for the Nation but being “in charge” is unlikely to concede to any reform.\nHierarchy is a means of running a complex system and when you have few “leaders” it works comparatively well albeit always biased in favour of the “leadership”. When Capitalism replaced the old feudal system it was simply replacing a “there by right” for a “thereby effort or luck”. It created opportunities for the able business person to get rich and the whole “feudal establishment” yielded to the new bourgeois power base.\nThe feudal establishment and institutions could yield because capitalism was a hierarchy. There was a “natural fit”.\nSo why is this a problem today? Well, today we don’t have a capitalist West we have a bankrupt free market. In the west we still have people schooled and socialised to believe they have a natural right to a high public office or large amounts of wealth, however, acquired.\nOur free market is based on mass consumption, not mass production and this consumption is paid for as we have said by tax, asset inflation and debt. Basically, we are no longer being “exploited” in the Marxist sense but to keep our hierarchical legal, political and every other public body in existence (Housing, Health, Education, military etc) with their 100K plus Barrons at the top (we call them the pubicsectocracy) we the people are being alienated into borrowing and allowing our governments to borrow trillions of Pounds or Dollars.\nThe western economic system is the most immoral in history and it is destroying the planet and itself.\nThe problem for the West is two-fold. By saving the banks and not having a long-term contingency to avoid the same problem again we are back on the banker’s money go round and we await the next and probably final cataclysmic failure. What will that usher in? Well, the end of democracy for a start.\nSecondly our binary Parliamentary and two-party system and 5-year cycle democracy (4 in the US) make real democracy and sustainable economic stability impossible. This is why all political parties turn to the short-termism of financial engineering. It is impossible to save ourselves with this model which can only ever favour the banks and commercial interests and not the Nation as a whole.\nBanks are vital to the health of the nation but today it is only ever the banks to the rescue of the state (even for the Labour party) and that’s bad for the Nation.\nThe solution is a Blue Revolution. Ordinary people shaping policy with more democracy not less. Long-term (30 years) planning by ending binary Parliamentary politics and the Party System, not by force but by voting for unaligned candidates. There needs to be a complete overhaul of what the state can and should do and a review of how it does it moving rapidly from an industrial model of service delivery to a “social model” where individual practitioners are interdependent and self-regulating, not top-down managed! and how much the state should pay “its” state people in wages and terms and conditions is also important in a post hierarchy age. This is because state workers are paid out of what are essentially the debts or taxes of the nation …….errrrr that it!",

We want to scream “a plague on all your (political) houses”. But where to start? As we registered on 19th November 2017 we have only a few twitter followers. So we have to “tweet” comment to an interesting array of the self-appointed twitterocracy who whether left or right singularly miss the people’s point that the system is at best rigged and at worst broken. So with the brevity of Twitter lets pick up two or three big-ticket issues missed by the left and right and comment.\nNumber one on the left wing is the nieve belief that the economy dependent as it is on debt can fund an even more active and interventionist state. They all queue up to extoll the merits of their version of Marxism singularly failing to grasp that Marx’s proletariat was creating social and economic value which was brought into existence by the capitalist’s production methods and is then misappropriated by the capitalist. The state then takes this value back on behalf of the worker. So far so 19th century. Today the economy relies on debt to provide the services people expect, but the state top slices tax income and uses debt to ensure it can pay for itself. Nice work if you can get it.\nNow the right. Margaret Thatcher oversaw what in the 1980’s was a radical policy of selling council homes. This was and still is seen as a way of nurturing Tory voters. However, this “revolution” was tied in with relaxing the financial sector and the slow remorseless shift of work away from Britain to China and countries that paid a “world” wage level as opposed to an “unaffordable” western one. What happened was that we in the west stopped making stuff and began consuming cheap stuff made in China. The old industrial-scale manufacturing and extractive economies in the west became a “marketing and sales” economy and this has, in turn, become a kind of economic “bandit country”. Now making money, not creating value is the “supply side” and the “demand side” is consumption paid for with debt both government and private much of it backed by house price value. Thatcher wasn’t to blame she couldn’t join the dots up, but the bankers could and still are\nFinally, the context of this mess is the canvass upon which politicians try to represent the people. On the left, the solution is government jobs and more debt welfare and healthcare without a thought about final economic collapse. On the right, it is to treat the unemployable victims of the world labour market as failures and to manage the decline of their communities whilst finding ways of passing the cost of the whole sorry mess onto the people, via low wage employment, student debt, and adult social care costs paid from the estate of the deceased, oh and more debt but not as much as under Labour.\nWith both parties so spectacularly missing the point about the true nature of the British economy the only conclusion we can come to is OMG!!.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_sorting-out-the-mess-how-conservatism-and-karl-marx-can-help/content_369.html": "Sorting out the mess, how conservatism and Karl Marx can help.\nKarl Marx as anyone who reads our posts will know was an economic determinist. Even now this is an ‘unfashionable’ theory as it places all ‘ideas’ as the outcome of economic circumstances, including religious and political ideas. Thus, the demands of religion or politics are simply a reflection of how economic value is created and who controls it and disposes of it. Every phase in history to date has been a struggle between those who have amassed economic value (the powerful) and those who created it for them (the poor).\nUntil the seventeenth century, most people were in bondage of one form or another, the birth of capitalism in the eighteenth century took away the overt bonds between the powerful and poor and replaced them with contract, choice and consent. Little changed but in theory at least people were ‘free’. With the end of the feudal system, hard work, luck and a talent for enterprise could turn anyone into a capitalist, even those who had previously been bound to others.\nThe world of the eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was characterised by ‘free’ people winning and losing economically. This economic paradox is what intrigued Karl Marx. Capitalism was a system that was in all senses ‘just’ but was clearly unfair. It was ‘just’ because it was based on Contract, Choice and Consent unlike the values of the feudal system, control, compulsion and coercion but….it was unfair because the elite, the capitalists, made the system work for their benefit. The composition of the capitalist class, unlike that of the aristocracy, changed as economic fortunes changed, but the system was politically robust enough to survive whoever was rich or poor. To preserve itself capitalism created institutions to support it. Political parties, parliaments, Laws and Local Authorities, an established religion and more recently ‘state broadcasters’ all combined to preserve the status quo. After the Second World War two socialist governments of both Labour and the Conservatives sought to extend the rights of contract, choice and consent to as many workers as possible as well as redistribute the economic value more evenly via tax and welfare regimes.\nWell, that story takes us to about 1960. After about 1960 capitalism went into one of its frequent periods of collapse. Capitalism collapses all the time and according to Karl Marx would finally leave a legacy of workers who could both recognise and utilise the principles of contract, choice and consent but within an economic system that was under the control of the workers and not the capitalists. The surplus value that made the capitalists rich would be distributed fairly amongst the working people who created it. The end of unfairness would arise because the people would have economic equality which would generate social equality and a fair income for all. Equality between all people, men, women, and people with a variety of different lifestyles would prevail as there would be no basis for discrimination as everyone’s talents would be needed within an economy of mutual interdependence. We are a long way from this model happening but some of the principles have merit, particularly if applied to the public sector.\nAll models of the economic and social organisation must arise from the base, from the working people who, recognising their equal status as workers only seek to take out of the collective pot an amount that reflects their contribution to the pot with some account taken of their unique needs (having children for example). The mechanism for this is of course contract, choice and consent. A process that both reflects and reinforces equality at every social and economic level; between politicians and people and between the people themselves.\nThe ‘State’ would shrink back and become merely a way of enforcing equality within the Nation and upholding Contract, Choice and Consent. A legal system would be needed not representing ‘capital’ but the sometimes conflicting needs of people within a contractarian society. This would take eighteenth and nineteenth-century capitalist principle into the twenty-first century. But something is preventing that happening.\nThe answer to why t hasn’t happened is complex. The ‘capitalist’ system was designed to protect ‘capital’ amassed by the rich, capital created by the worker. Today we have the ghost of a capitalist system that has collapsed but leaving behind its complex eighteenth-century formal power relationships. So, the good news for the worker is that we have contract, choice and consent welfare and health care. The bad news is the system still requires unequally distributed wealth to function and this is now created by the banking system and the State at large via National Debt and we the working people are paying for an army of rich public servants and a financial and political elite with personal and National Debt.\nBecause the nature of the problem is complex the problem we have in changing this situation is also complex. As working people, we still don’t see ourselves as a mass movement sharing the same values, so we idly identify ourselves with political parties of all stripes that are hostile to our instinctive dislike of the debt-financed political and economic elite. In this sense, the confused socialist and Green party along with the Lib Dems stand for a continuation of the top-down relationship between State and People even though ‘capitalism’ as an economic system requiring a command and control relationships to protect ‘capital’ no longer exists. It’s an oddity that socialism is in Marxist terms still a top-down, command and control ideology, that seeks to reinforce the power of the State and is, in Marxist terms, therefore ‘counter-revolutionary. In that sense Blair, Corbyn and Clinton are all the same. Counter-revolutionaries and the people instinctively know it.\nSo, into this ideological muddle comes the principles of A Blue Revolution. A worker’s revolution that seeks to take the values of our society, contract, choice and consent and use them to form a State that is flatter, cheaper, economically more equal and significantly more democratic and ecologically less harmful.\nThis model won’t be delivered by a socialist type party. Socialism is paternalistic and relies on a powerful State just like top-down religion requires a powerful God to deliver ‘justice’. Socialism is no help to the future, indeed with its top-down obsessions, it is getting in the way of progress.\nSo it leaves either an upsurge in support for A Blue Revolution, which is unlikely in the next two decades or an enlightened Conservative Party to do the Nations bidding and restructure our State along the lines sketched out above. The detail will be more complex but broadly the public sector must be reconfigured so public services like health and police etc are not delivered using industrial top-down hierarchical models with huge wages at the top, which are unreflective of the actual effort put in. We need to develop what we describe as social models to deliver public services.\nSimilarly, the State needs to withdraw from all areas of moral behaviour aside from protecting the vulnerable and allow all adults to ‘contract’ as responsible people. We can no longer afford to subsidize ‘lifestyle’ issues and that must include having children. If people want to have children, they should contract with each other and not simply default to the ‘State’ to pay for them. There is no ‘capitalist’ paying taxes for our welfare, we are all paying for it with our debt. Marriage should be a proper contract and the state should simply ensure a contract exists if people have children, just as it does for a property.\nFinally, our political system is binary to reflect the eighteenth-century obsession with land and capital. Binary systems are prone to failure in the modern world as the two sides coalesce around ‘ideological’ positions and the people get ignored. This has happened too many times to recount but the EU is the most striking example of political failure. We need to change the political system so that people get in who are able and willing to think rather than obey party diktat. If we got rid of parties or rather they got rid of themselves and we had a larger number of politically minded people involved in running our nation we would not need to reform the electoral system. We only need to do that because we have political parties operating within a binary parliament.\nThe revolution may come eventually, but we hope before the debt-dependent free market collapses or the top down cultural Marxists inflict either totalitarianism on the workers or even worse religion takes hold. No one really knows what they the elite are up to. But everything they have done over the last forty years fails the sniff test.",

The anxious foot-soldiers of the illiberal elite clearly believe that Trump represents a shamelessly divisive and discriminatory perspective and will roll back decades of progress in respect of social integration and sexual equality. This is of course, as far as we are concerned, rubbish. The reason is that the U.S. is a democracy with a constitution that makes it impossible for Trump to deliver an agenda based on hatred or discrimination. He may send some reproductive rights back to the individual States but that is pretty much as far as he could go.\nWhat the foot soldiers of the illiberal elite are protesting about is that Clinton didn’t have an argument at the U.S. election and therefore lost. She and the elite demonstrated an absence of a so-called “liberal ideology” that takes America beyond the Clinton, Bush, Obama status quo. A status quo which has sucked up to amongst others the Saudi’s with their heroic record of women’s rights whilst turning on others no better but certainly no worse.\nThe foot soldiers of the elite don’t know who to blame for the mess America (and the EU)) is in. The wealth inequality, the celebrity culture, the banking crisis, social and moral decay etc. The foot soldiers can’t possibly blame themselves or the liberal elite who have helped them gain their individual personal identity and employed them in the government sector. All this whilst giving the blue collar workers the order of the boot as their jobs were exported abroad.\nSo they will blame Trump for…. well-being Trump, a seventy-year-old locker room jock with wandering hands, bad hair, cringeworthy chat up lines, and a self-important turn of phrase. In the overall scheme of things Trump probably comes in well ahead of Obama and Bush in the sexual preoccupation stakes……but well behind “old man” Clinton, the adulterers’ adulterer.\nAs we posted yesterday Trump will, of course, be his own undoing. Which is sad. But it is unlikely to be a sexual impropriety that does for him.",

Two revolutions since we were able to create more wealth than we needed as a species to survive. When this happened, it was possible to distribute it equally or alternatively for one man and his family or group to acquire that wealth and acquire the power that went with it. This latter model was revolution number one, it took much of humankind from hand to mouth tribal reality into the world of power, politics and inequality, in short, political authority was born. Whole systems of laws and faith were created to promote the ‘normality’ of this arrangement.\nReligion tried to compensate for the inequality of this new economic world order. However economic reality cast aside the idealised visions of heaven on earth promoted by faiths like Judaism Christianity and Islam and gave only heaven in heaven.\nThis system of aristocratic families ‘owning’ almost all the wealth created by slaves and workers continued for thousands of years slowly moving out from the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Eventually, it arrived in Europe by the turn of the second millennium. Britain was probably too swampy, cold and hilly to generate enough wealth for anyone to waste time trying to acquire it after the Romans left……until 1066 or thereabouts.\nOnce Britain became subject to this autocratic feudal exploitation, any notion of equality disappeared and lives became a struggle to survive, not just survive against nature herself but against powerful ‘political’ forces too. Natural events shaped the reality of everyone’s lives, but whether it was war or famine the ‘top people’ the aristocracy always fared much better than those toiling at the bottom. And moreover, the ‘top people’ fought the ‘rabble’ to ensure the survival of their system.\nFamine was a reality for the poor, but famine and plague were touch papers for the next great revolution. Again, economics played the most significant role. A shortage of labour drove up wages creating a class of trading merchants who by increasing their wealth could challenge the rights of crown, church and aristocracy.\nFamine stoked riots but also stimulated agricultural innovation. The feudal system was quietly being undermined from the economic base. The religious legitimacy of a feudal ruler was now capable of being challenged by a class of people wealthy because of hard work and enterprise. Eventually, revolution number two swept away British Catholicism and promoted the work ethic.\nBy the seventeenth century, having been convulsed by revolution number two which whilst superficially about religion had its real origins in economics, the merchant class amassing a popular revolt finally took away through revolution the power of the king.\nCapitalism was born from the ashes of the feudal system. Like all revolutions, it salvaged what it could from the ‘old ways’ adopting feudalisms top-down structure but with an economic model based on new ideas like the freedom to acquire wealth using principles of contract, choice and consent. Capitalism paid for its power outsourcing control to parliaments and courts rather than acquiring its own power based on feudal entitlement, status and birthright.\nThis populist revolution created the basis of our present Parliamentary and legal system. A mixture of feudalism and capitalism; a kind of political labradoodle. Not one thing nor the other! Very expensive, class-based but not status based. However, the elite capitalists paid for the system out of the profits made for them by the working class. Workers paid nothing directly to the state until about the twentieth century.\nThis model worked on and off, well into the twentieth century, notwithstanding the odd crisis or the wars it caused when it failed in places like Germany in the 1900s or 1930s. Where it has been successful it has for two hundred years underpinned freedom and rights to contract, make personal choices and consent to lives in general. Also unlike the other two other systems which pre dated it, tribalism and feudalism it has been flexible enough to extend rights to all adults by the late twentieth century. The left doesn’t understand the concept, but the world’s future should not be about socialism but about progressive capitalism. The rights-based equality of progressive capitalism is why ideologies promoted by the UN that hate equality, particularly for women, are turning capitalism into a hated ideology to be destroyed because of its origins in white European economics. As well as attacks from autocrats, ill-informed socialists and religious cranks, capitalism has its own problems too.\nBy the 1970s capitalism was again beginning to fail. Most of us didn’t realise it because just like the elite of the sixteenth century holding on to their feudal power, our ‘global’ elite began selling us the idea that all’s well in the global economy by creating the global ‘free market’. This approach enables them to hang onto their power. The so-called left-wing assist, acting like useful idiots using the new religion of ‘identity and diversity’ which differentiates the working class and sows class oppression and class confusion. So within the framework of capitalist rights and free market muddle have we got to the point of a third and probably final popular uprising or revolution?\nCapitalism needs both the supply of goods and just as importantly the demand for them. Henry Ford paid his workers’ good wages and gave them time off so they could not only afford to buy a car…..they had time to drive it for leisure. Today we have broken this link between productive workers and consumers. We have out of the ashes of a broken capitalist system turned to debt to create the demand for products which as we consume them, make our global elite very rich but the debt both government and personal makes us poor. This is for us the first whammy. We pay with debt for a system that makes a political and economic elite rich.\nIn our globalised world our global elite doesn’t pay tax and moreover, they don’t employ many people. Those they do employ are on low wages, work in oppressive countries or at home their jobs are often subsidized by our governments and that means the taxpayer foots the bill. This is the second whammy.\nThe third and final whammy is that our whole debt based political and legal system is now very expensive having grown in size and scale since the end of the second world war. Now, of course, we ordinary workers have to pay for it.\nSo, what does this mean? It means we need another revolution. Revolution number three. A revolution based on working peoples twenty-first-century global economic realities. So in summary we have populism because:\n- The political and economic system is more expensive than it has ever been but now ordinary workers, rather than the elite pay for it.\n- Governments encourage debt to maintain the illusion that the economy works. It doesn’t, no economy can rely on debt and welfare forever.\n- Working people’s voices have become excluded from political debate due to the end of open politics. Our current economic system has no money to distribute so left-wing politics is irrelevant and the capitalist system is now a bankrupt free-market relying on worker serviced private and government debt, so right-wing politics is irrelevant- we no longer need to debate this stuff we need a revolution!\n- To preserve the rights, we gained with capitalism the right to contract, choose and consent, we need to ensure the free market survives. But that free markets survival can’t be based on debt. We need to shrink the bloated, unaccountable undemocratic and expensive state and give workers more time and more money to run our nation on our behalf. This is not socialism. This is not the power of the state controlling our lives but our lives controlling the state.\nIs this revolution a long way off?\nAs working people, we are still holding out for a hero a Nigel Farage or Donald Trump? Or we are holding out for a political ‘party’ to save us. In France, they thought it was Macron! Any person or party which has to fit into our 18th-century political system will fail.\nThe system within which our heroes and parties operate is broken just like the economy. We need a new system that promotes our western values but doesn’t rely on the past political system to deliver our future. We need a revolution, a peoples revolution, a revolution of the independently minded blue collar worker. A Blue Revolution to bring religion to heel, promote equality, control top public sector wages, make corporations pay tax on national earnings, give workers more money and time and shrink the state so we can afford to live in it.\nThat is the workers challenge for the twenty first century.\nJon Steen\nThe Monopolism we have imposed on us will collapse.

As most ordinary people consider it to be a matter for the individual. Push them a little harder and they will possibly say it is not a matter for the taxpayer. However, the bourgeois rights to contract, choose and consent in reality means that this like so much else in a civilised community is down to the individual concerned. It doesn’t require any further analysis.\nOh but wait…the intellectual left feel the urge to promote the issue to the point where their opinions start to reveal the rather unpleasant underbelly of their prejudice, a kind of “left-wing shadow self”. How so? Well, a young person transitioning from male to female called Lilly wanted to be included in “woman of the year”. There was a lot of unpleasant “trolling” before the “intellectual” left came along in support of the position Lilly had adopted that “a trans woman is still a woman”. Well, sadly this position is insulting to women, in the same way, that a white person “appropriating” Black culture and changing their skin colour, is insulting to black people.\nBy adopting the position they have, the “intellectual” left have shown themselves again to be misogynistic in that they are happily demeaning the experience of being a woman in what is the hostile and unfemale-friendly culture of the 21st century. From Saidi Arabia to London and New York women are indexed, categorised and preyed upon, abused, executed and murdered based on gender plus class; looks and desirability; race, status and lifestyle. No transitioning male to female can “appropriate” that negative experience of being born a woman and to deny the relevance of that life experience when it is so significant. It is as we have said an insult to women the world over.\nSo what is the answer? Well it is quite simple really we either have to get rid of gender and all “characteristics” so anyone can be anything, a woman can try for “man of the year” and vice versa, or we simply stick to gender as like race having “cultural status” and discourage or prevent inappropriate “cultural appropriation”. Mind you we could simply start a “Trans man or woman of the year” award and get over the whole issue and move on!.",

A bit like library closure perhaps. Whilst some rural areas and town centres may either benefit from lights out, allowing the night sky to re-establish its prominence or don’t require it as there are sufficient shop lights to illuminate the area, there are those areas where the lights out is clearly a hazard. Most noble amongst which is Woad Farm estate.\nThe complexity of the issue must not be used to justify us swerving it, as it affects some of the most vulnerable communities in Boston. It is simply not acceptable for LCC to increase Council tax and then claim it is necessary to make “essential” cuts whilst paying some senior managers six-figure salaries with pensions to boot. This situation has built up over many decades where general tax payers and council tax payers are increasingly funding wage levels that lift too many government workers into the financial fist division.\nThis wage structure owes more to the nineteenth century than the twenty-first century and governments and local authorities need to stop and think about the people on average wages and lower who pay them and thus the majority the people they are supposed to serve.\nLCC should be shamed into adopting a more considered policy on lighting, switch off where it adds value to communities and switch back on where the same thing applies.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_hierarchy-and-the-link-to-alienation-and-social-injustice/content_93.html": "Hierarchy and the link to alienation and social injustice.\nIn classical Marxist theory surplus (economic) value and the role of the workers who both create it and have it “exploited” from them by capitalists, is central to how both capitalism and socialism work.\nThe process of taking surplus value from workers is akin to theft but that is not the term Marx used, he was perhaps being too polite or more likely he didn’t see capitalism as an unjust system, just unfair. Theft is unjust, exploitation unfair!\nThe worker works longer hours than he or she needs to, so as to ensure that surplus value is created and in doing so they develop an instrumental relationship to their work. They can’t enjoy it but they have to do it to live. The conclusion we draw from this process is that workers work too much and it is time rather than money that is the basis of 19th-century capitalisms unfairness. The industrial structures of the factory also reinforce the worker’s sense of powerlessness. They are not in control of the industrial processes that determine the pace of their working lives.\nThis demand for the workers surplus value and the environment within which it is created is the capitalist systems manifestation of the age-old problem of one human, generally male, and holding a superior position taking away from someone else what that someone else has worked hard to create, whilst to varying degrees controlling that person’s life. Every society since the birth of human consciousness has been discriminatory in one form or another. Underpinning this process of discrimination is control by a hierarchy, differently configured, as either tribe, feudal system or industrial hierarchy which causes the worker to feel powerless or oppressed and in the case of capitalism having external control on their work. There is in all societies a trend for control, the controls differ markedly from society to society.\nThe process of capitalist exploitation gives rise to another classic Marxist theory, the theory of “alienation”. Thus the surplus value taken by the capitalist from the worker is a kind of monetary reflection of the extent of the worker’s alienation.\nAlienation is the physical and psychological effect of a worker being exploited. In a strange ironic twist fate for the world, the solution offered by the free market to the alienated worker is the almost limitless supply of goods. The demand for goods by workers has replaced religion as the “opium of the people”. This perhaps explains the success and survival of the free market given it has a debt-dependent and a planet-destroying legacy. People accept being alienated so long as they can purchase goods and the system will produce jobs and goods as long as the debt is available to pay for them.\nNow bringing things up to date surplus value is no longer being produced by the capitalist system in sufficient quantities to be taxed by the government and thereby service the social, health, welfare and other state obligations. As a result of western capitalisms failure (it thrives elsewhere!), free market indebtedness has become the means by which the free market a remnant of the western capitalist system, is able to function and produce apparent wealth.\nWorkers exploitation and alienation have become markedly different since the mid 19th century. Today people have developed a taste for buying stuff made abroad and pay for it with debt that they have to work to pay off. All this in the false belief that spending overcomes alienation rather than reinforcing it, giving alienation in effect a social character. Arguably divorce rates reflect alienation’s social character, people only being concerned about themselves.\nThe description of capitalism based on a classical model no longer works today as it would have worked for Marx. So what has happened to exploitation, and alienation within the 21st-century free market?\nWhilst the impression given by the advocates of the modern western economy is one of promoting abundant goods and services for the consumer, the reality is that it is cheap foreign manufactured goods that mask the continued existence of alienation. In a world with little actual classical capitalist exploitation, how does exploitation still exist and are workers still alienated? We think these are good questions and we will attempt to give a fuller answer here.\nWhereas the Classical Marxist worker was not rich enough to get into debt, today the whole western economic model depends upon workers and government debt. What we have is what we at ABlueRevolution call deptamorphosis.\nThis is the process which sees the worker using their debt to promote a wealthy free-market elite. They do this working long hours often in public service organisations which are still modelled on 19th-century industrial hierarchies. Many earn money paid from government debt, to service their personal debt-dependent lifestyle. This is as alienating for the worker today as it was in the 19th century as they have no influence over their working practices (KPI’s today), nor the ability to escape the treadmill of debt. Just like in Marx’s day the worker has “freedom” to leave the workplace but has little likelihood of using it.\nThus whilst the working environment is a safer environment than in Marx’s day it is no less alienating. Today the worker may be doing work that has little or no economic value, and more controversially little social value either. A state employment system based on hierarchical industrial models and which pays its workers to blame the unemployed because their jobs have gone to China or a health service maintaining a low level of wellness in a system all paid for with debt is alienating for all. This is not an economy free of alienation. Workers don’t feel linked to the people they serve as customers or patients, they are forced to feel a closer link to the system which controls them and pays them. No difference here to the hierarchy of the industrial era and there are huge differentials in pay.\nLikewise expecting the worker to become indebted to make “free marketeers” and public servants rich is a new way of exploiting workers that Karl Marx could not have identified if he had lived into the mid 20th century.\nPerhaps the solution is to look at where in any modern organisation the social value is created and liberate workers at that level casting out of the organisations the people who have high wages paid to them but they offer little in the way of social value.\nIf Capitalism had been forced to yield to the dictatorship of the workers, as opposed to evolving into the debt-dependent planet-destroying monster the free market has become, then it is the capitalist and their exploiting hierarchy that would have been put asunder, not the work or the workers themselves. There are lessons here for operational public servants in all departments of the state and the army of 100k+ a year bosses who manage them.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_537/content_257.html": "Trust us, the western world could ball itself up and toss itself into the dustbin of history. Why? because we have no positive “narrative”.\nLook around the world and you see nations engaging in a kind of verbal warfare. Better of course than actual warfare but pointless and limiting. The problem is or so it seems to us, too many countries fail to understand their shared value base. They, for one reason or another, prefer to obsess about difference rather than what is similar or familiar. The reason is probably because they came to where they are via different routes.\nJust as you can “hack” across the English countryside to get to Sheffield, you can also take the motorway. Both journeys end up at the same place but the experience of getting there will be very different. So like Russia and the West we have arrived at a 21st century socioeconomic system that is broadly the same; Debt based and consumer driven. This is currently where all western type nations stand. Nations who have, by dint of capitalist exploitation or exploitation by the industrialised state, got to a point where working people have acquired a level of freedom which is different from cultures which are for other reasons locked into a mediaeval “dark ages”. North Korea, Saudi Arabia and most of the Middle East, are feudal systems propped up by wealth controlled by a state elite who ruthlessly control power. No good being an outspoken soldier in North Korea or an outspoken woman is Saudi. This would be too much for the “state”. Death would await.\nThe perversity of why the West is as it is, is to us quite simple. Before you can equalise people (moving away from gender or race based discrimination for example) you have to prolatarianise them. It is the process of prolatarianisation, be it private capitalist or state capitalist systems like Russia, which drives the demand for equality. Industrialisation simply needs workers, not male workers or female workers, black workers or white workers but workers! Eventually Gay workers etc. Countries that have not industrialised and have not therefore prolatarianised cannot deliver freedom and equality. It simply isn’t in the cultural vocabulary for them to do so. So invariably you end up with a North Korea or Saudi Arabia, Myanmar or wherever. It is just the way it is. Look at a woman in a Burka and you don’t see a person defined by her work you see a woman defined by her gender. Scary stuff if you are a woman on the left wing of politics!\nNow this reflects a problem for the West in that we no longer have a “capitalist” system, reinforcing capitalist principles of contract, choice and consent.\nCapitalism, before it morphed into the ghastly debt based “free market”, had spawned one very significant but ignorant and ungrateful offspring, namely socialism. Socialists don’t seem to see that the wealth spent by socialist governments came from capitalism, wealth they spent on welfare systems and social reform.\nSocialists somehow think that this bounteous wealth came from the actions of socialist governments alone and not from the actions of industry and workers. It’s ignorance makes it careless about the freedoms that have flowed from capitalism. The freedom for women to work, to be part of the political system, to freely marry divorce and have lives determined by them and not the state or their gender, is thanks, not to socialism alone, but to the principles laid down in early capitalist society. Without those principle socialism would have had neither the vocabulary nor the money to effect real change in peoples lives via health, welfare and personal rights.\nHowever modern socialism with its state managed obsessions about diversity and its embrace of all things anti capitalist, is now in danger of promoting systems of rights which are pre capitalist and pre socialist. Rights defined by gender predominantly. Today socialism provides a fertile home, particularly in the United Kingdom,for islamists, misogynists, anti Semites and homophobes to flourish. The sad thing is most modern socialists including our old friend Jeremy Corbyn are too ill informed about socialisms roots to realise it, or to understand how they contribute to it…..as too are most of their voters.\nOnly a Blue Revolution can take ordinary workers on a progressive journey into the future, preserving our hard fought for workers rights and freedoms. Sadly the modern left will simply bankrupt us, ball us up and drop our culture into the dustbin of history, followed shortly by socialism itself!",

The opportunity cost of a car might be the foreign holiday you can’t have because you have the car. In politics we have reached a point where the left and right unite to maintain the existing political system and the opportunity cost is a democracy and a political system that can encompass all shades of British public opinion and manage it with fairness and transparency.\nThe reason for this is for us quite simple. Both left and right either don’t recognise that our 19th-century political system was based on an evolving class system which has now ceased to exist in any meaningful sense or they want to protect their own party based model. The party model was always based on power groups who managed as an elite and promoted vested interests. This went on right up to the 1940’s when the Labour party created a post-war political settlement which delivered much-needed welfare to the working classes. This 19th-century model has and always will swap power between two opposing parties and even the hard left would rather see this system continue rather than demand its reform. The best anyone can come up with is reform of the electoral system which will leave the power structures intact and protect the rights of the elites of left and right to govern us as they see fit. Along with them, you have the media also deploying the lazy journalism of the ‘reductive polarity’ so as to reflect the interests of their polarised parliamentary collaborators.\nIt’s incredible but the left wing really doesn’t get that the way power is delivered and managed in this parliamentary structure and the vested interests whether it is media, money or the Trades Unions that underpin the way power is delivered are holding back the social progress that they claim to want so much. It is baffling too, that the right wing says they want small government and lower taxes whilst continuing to promote as a model for 21st-century democracy an increasingly remote, expensive and unrepresentative political system. Some people might conclude from this we are anti-monarchy, we are not! The Monarch is the only part of this creaking 19th-century system that works and is seen to work by the people. It’s the parliamentary bit that needs change before it goes pop, or the people do!",

The problem with Grenfell is that the actual residents were somewhere down the pecking order when decisions were being made about their block. The experts made decisions that have resulted in a bleak but safe 197o’s tower block being turned into a slightly less bleak death trap. Now is not the time for emotion. But emotion seems to be the order of the day served up by an emotionally promiscuous media.\nThe Judge who has been identified to head up the Public Enquiry is described as too remote from the victims to be fair and impartial. What the victims want is someone who can emote about the tragedy. Senior Judges leap to the Judge’s defence. The problem here is that the demand for an emotional reaction is as problematic in 21st century Britain as posh Judges being seen as remote because they are posh. With the establishment and their 18th-century institutions unable to adapt so that ordinary people can prosper among them, one-half of the regrettable binary which seems to unite the muddle-headed supporters of the left is emotion. Emotion versus rationality. The ’emotional’ is the key to Corbyn’s success and it explains not only the Tories failure but also how Corbyn can unite Mumsnet, students, hard middle and soft left, public sector workers and luvvies.\nThe emotional and rationality binary is just another dispiriting binary in modern 21ct century Britain. A binary that includes political left and right as well as Leave and Remain on Brexit, Islamophobia and the observant Muslims fear of secular western culture and it’s corrosive values particularly on issues such as family life and debt based economics. Until we tackle our binary culture and the institutions which support it including the party system, Parliament and Courts we will see emotion moving centre stage and Corbyn’s left with it. Our enlightenment values which triggered our Capitalism and industrialisation and modern cultural identity are in retreat and with them, our rights and freedoms will start to disappear too.

Well as Karl Marx said “history repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce”.\nWe can assume that capitalism didn’t fail before it was created so we have the first tragedy of capitalism in the late 1920’s leading to the Second World War a decade later. Capitalism was rescued by that war and later fake news militarism in the US and welfarism in the UK provided the economic stimulus that let “neoclassical” economics reboot capitalism and then presides over a slow relentless decline until western capitalisms death in the mid 1980’s. The Second World War war was the tragedy….and today post the 1980’s we have the farce. How so?\nWell, capitalism has failed again. If you don’t believe us just consider what capitalism needs to justify its name. It needs capital and that capital has to be the misappropriated value taken from the workers who created it by, you guessed it Capitalists. What we have now is the ridiculous spectacle of the rich simply and like Sir Phillip Green lazily tapping off the proceeds of workers and taxpayer debt, acquired in the form of profit for rubbish mostly manufactured at low cost in China. This is not capitalism…this is the free market. The free market is the “farce” in Marx’s quote above.\nSo when capitalism is exhausted to the point of extinction in the Western world and the “state” has given up trying to tap off economic value from capitalist because they no longer exist (rich people are not the same as capitalists whatever Britain’s Labour Party think) we are all encouraged to turn to the smoke and mirrors, the Alice in wonderland alchemy of debt. Debtamorphosis is what we call it. No one really understands how this debt based system drives odd behaviours and creates values that are unfair to the poor. Debt also promotes lifestyles that, whilst not exactly immoral are hardly mainstream. Welcome to the Marxian 21st-century farce.\nWe will consider this later but it is not pretty. Handbagging between the west and Russia, “fake news”, proxy wars between adolescent nations that are still to grow up and a western world that is narcissistic, obsessed with itself and yet self-loathing enough like some neurotic bingeing on debt before throwing up at each and every economic convulsion since 1945.\nThe free market needs to create only one side of the economic binary of demand and supply, and unlike in the old days when supply created it’s own demand via wages and profits now the system needs only to have demand. But with the link to production, working and wages severed the demand has to come from somewhere and it comes from debt. That is the dirty secret that a few “oddballs” talk about on programmes like Russia Today but their smugnesses the western mainstream media ignore.\nBut a debt based economy has many flaws. Firstly it is unsustainable as the debt can never be paid off as it simply goes into immediate consumption. That is why the screeching socialist of Corbyn’s Momentum have no idea what they are talking about. Debt based “anti-austerity” without a corresponding productive investment is simply wasted on the here and now. And the biggest waster of debt would be the left wing’s sanctified socialist state.\nThe next problem with debt is planetary. Whilst we grumble and Corbyn’s Momentum screech about “austerity” the poorer parts of the world look on in horror as valueless debt based wealth gobbles up the planet’s resources to meet the shallow needs of the western worlds entitled consumers. The world is being destroyed not simply be consumption….but by its progenitor, debt.\nDebt is as we all know tomorrows consumption today. So it affects the young who have to pay off the debt and in doing so maintain their own consumption paid for by more debt. The additional burden the Wests young have though is with their already indebted governments. These governments help to indebt the young with student loans and higher house prices (a direct result of the cash-raising against their asset price inflated property of the baby boomers). It could not be worse for the young. The solution, build more houses, invite in more migrant workers to ensure demand and borrow more money which is the left wing answer simply makes matters worse. Worse because new houses will simply become an asset against which working people can borrow more cash. Without that debt however the economy will quickly contract. Real as opposed to a pretend austerity.\nSo within all this, the beneficiaries of the debt based economy, essentially the wealthy public servants and the financial elite know that at some point ordinary people will not simply be mentally pauperised by stupidity they will be financially pauperised by debt. They the elite, however, will jet off to join the other world elites who using more traditional forms of exploitation (like pumping oil out of the ground and keeping the sales receipts) have carved out places of pleasure in more agreeable parts of the globe like Dubai.\nThis final point explains the “Big Ticket” consequences of our 21st-century farce. World tensions and fake news. The world has too much debt to go to war. No one could prosecute a serious conflict for more than about a week. And with nuclear weapons and so much synergy between most modern nations who would want to go to war anyway. So we have conflict zones where a scaled-down battle rages between those who can see the West’s debt-based economic model for what it is an Alice in Wonderland alchemy, for example, The Russian Federation, ISIS, North Korea, and Iran and those who think the model creates a haven for liberty but who simply fail to understand how it really doesn’t do that at all.\nIn addition to the proxy wars, we have the farce of fake news. Fake news has been a staple of the western world for years. Who the hell knew what was really going on in the 1950’s to 1990’s. However only now is news being used to “call out” the Western hegemony for the debt-fuelled nonsense it really is. And the western powers don’t like it. Fake news in the new farcical “cold war”\nThe sad truth is that western politicians are too stupid to understand how they are being played by a system that is enslaving their voters with debt. They fail to see that fake news is simply a critique of the west by nations who are more traditional about how they exploit their people. There are the seeds of revolution within all this but at the moment most people would prefer to stick with debt. The economics of the West both left and right wing is such a farce you couldn’t make it up.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_is-there-misogyny-at-the-root-of-the-lefts-current-obsession-with-transgenderism/content_331.html": "Is there misogyny at the root of the left’s current obsession with transgenderism?\nMost ordinary people have had a sufficient raising of their consciousness not to be too concerned or indeed perplexed by an individuals desire to “transition”. As most ordinary people consider it to be a matter for the individual. Push them a little harder and they will possibly say it is not a matter for the taxpayer. However, the bourgeois rights to contract, choose and consent in reality means that this like so much else in a civilised community is down to the individual concerned. It doesn’t require any further analysis.\nOh but wait…the intellectual left feel the urge to promote the issue to the point where their opinions start to reveal the rather unpleasant underbelly of their prejudice, a kind of “left-wing shadow self”. How so? Well, a young person transitioning from male to female called Lilly wanted to be included in “woman of the year”. There was a lot of unpleasant “trolling” before the “intellectual” left came along in support of the position Lilly had adopted that “a trans woman is still a woman”. Well, sadly this position is insulting to women, in the same way, that a white person “appropriating” Black culture and changing their skin colour, is insulting to black people.\nBy adopting the position they have, the “intellectual” left have shown themselves again to be misogynistic in that they are happily demeaning the experience of being a woman in what is the hostile and unfemale-friendly culture of the 21st century. From Saidi Arabia to London and New York women are indexed, categorised and preyed upon, abused, executed and murdered based on gender plus class; looks and desirability; race, status and lifestyle. No transitioning male to female can “appropriate” that negative experience of being born a woman and to deny the relevance of that life experience when it is so significant. It is as we have said an insult to women the world over.\nSo what is the answer? Well it is quite simple really we either have to get rid of gender and all “characteristics” so anyone can be anything, a woman can try for “man of the year” and vice versa, or we simply stick to gender as like race having “cultural status” and discourage or prevent inappropriate “cultural appropriation”. Mind you we could simply start a “Trans man or woman of the year” award and get over the whole issue and move on!.",

We avoid ducking the issues!\nComplicated but we sensitively pick our way through the issues. But no holds barred. The western world and Islam have totally differing values and expectations and there is no point in pretending otherwise. The western world, shaped by the Enlightenment and then the slow relentless march of progress from feudalism through capitalism to the debt funded and amoral “free market” contrasts with a faith still in many ways wedded to traditional notions of gender, tribe and caste. The “free market” is the response to the collapse of capitalism. It maintains the capitalist systems ability to create wealth and concentrate it into a few lucky hands but it extends the commodification of the proletarian as having only his labour to sell allowing anyone to sell anything about themselves, free of moral restrictions and constraints. The wealth generated by the free market is, unlike its capitalist forerunner, largely debt derived. This makes the free market doubly amoral and utterly dependent on government and taxpayer to maintain it.\nThis system we call secular western-ism. It is a western hegemonic structure that is promoted by corporations, banks and governments and leads to behaviour that in any other time or place would be seen as utterly intolerable. Whilst in the West we go on carousing and living on a diet of self-interest and greed in places like Saudi Arabia people loose their lives for living like we do in the west unless of course, they are well-connected. This is particularly true for women as in Islam the basic differences are not “class” but gender. Moral relativism fails women as it does not evaluate culture on any moral basis but accepts moral equivalence. However, for us, “class” is more significant than gender and class-based social progress underpins our progress and determines the freedoms we enjoy male or female gay straight or whatever.\nWhilst the observant Muslim quietly practices their faith they promote through their devotions and their dress a social structure that has no link to the class based evolution of western culture. The treatment of women in Islam (which is theological in character) represents a period which has not experienced the evolution of women’s rights from male chattel to proletarian in her own right and hence to her liberation from male oppression as a man’s equal in the labour market (whatever the morally relative feminists of the left might argue). This reality affects perceptions and gives rise to what is called “Islamophobia”. Ask any person who has not been schooled in Western liberal guilt what they think of Muslims and all too many will express hostile opinions. For ordinary people particularly women the differences cannot be ignored or argued away with platitudes. The differences are raw and frighten the Western person who has no experience of cultures that practice overt culturally determined control which is gender, or sexuality based.\nSo what we have is a clash of phobias. Islamophobia versus Secularphobia. The latter being the observant Muslim’s fear of us. And fear our culture they should in its amoral form just as we should fear them their observance of a way of life unreformed by the Enlightenment and capitalism.",

Any critical comment about Islam is thus stifled to the point where western values are set aside in a desperate attempt to avoid perceptions of racism. When criminals use Islam to justify their criminality be it terrorism or sexual abuse of children the only acceptable response for the brainwashed western liberal is “it is nothing to do with Islam”. But of course it is and at the same time, it doesn’t have to be. We have seen the effects of the liberal establishment ignoring abuse because of fear of being labelled Islamaphobic and whilst it is pathetic the costs to the vulnerable are real. So we will explain our position again.\nFirstly the Koran is a book that prescribes a lifestyle which is at best hostile to some western behaviours, for example, homosexuality and sexual freedom for women and at worst is brutal in its treatment of transgressors. But the Old Testament and certain parts of the New Testament suggest that the Bible has pretty much the same values. So like a loaded gun, the books themselves are neutral. They both contain authority and prescribe and proscribe behaviours. What makes the books, like the loaded gun, dangerous is the mind of the person who uses the book or wields the gun.\nIn the case of the West, the mindset of the European and those countries that were influenced by the West experienced firstly enlightened thinking in the 16th and 17th century and then capitalism and finally industrialisation. These phenomenal changes took received wisdom and put it into a historical dustbin. The idea began that people had economic rights, the right to contract to choose and consent which eventually took on a social character and arising from this we have liberal and freethinking democratic people who can put the tenets of their faith into a liberal framework. This framework recognises the rights of others. The tension with Islam is that too many observant Muslims can’t do this or won’t do it, believing that people have obligations to behave as willed by God. Thus women, Jewish people and Gay people have rights or perhaps no rights that are prescribed and may be not of their choosing.\nThe issue of terrorism, therefore, is not just about criminal acts of terror, it has to be put into a broader theological context. The question all people of faith should be asked is this, “are you personally able to accept the right of others to have a lifestyle that they want to have, be that a Gay lifestyle or to be sexually liberated as a woman or to believe in a faith other than your faith”. A question like this should be asked of all people who profess faith and hold public office (not just Tim Farron) to confirm that the liberating effects of Western culture has left its imprint on them and they are not colluding with or encouraging discrimination of any kind and perhaps inadvertently fueling crime in the name of religion.",

This anthropological trope goes back to tribal times. Women had women’s roles and men there role. Homosexuality was a threat to the tribe in numerous ways so punishment for this “difference” was harsh. Adultery likewise. As humankind began to evolve via technologies like farming, maintenance of this primitive “status quo” became a challenge taken up by Leading men for example kings. Since our earliest times, there has been a tension between those demanding economic and social change and those attempting to preserve the status quo.\nFrom biblical times to the late 16th Century little in the known world changed. What had always been wrong continued to be wrong. What needed to continue, continued. The wealth created by the economic activity from Bible times to the 16th century found its way into the hands of an elite. The gender discrimination first practised in tribal times was still found in what has become known as the feudal world. There was no impetus to change this because the world still needed this difference.\nGender difference, prohibitions against “choice” and “consent” and an absence of any “rights” not sanctioned by an overlord was a reality for everyone. However, for women, the first form of fascism was mans’ dominion over them and until comparatively recently all cultures accepted it.\nWhilst the wars during this long millennial period were about territory and faith there was little difference in the defined role of the vanquished men and women. What we would describe today as discrimination flourished.\nFor everyone, men and women there was no Contract, Choice or Consent. This arrived in the late 17th early 18th century when things slowly start to change. Commerce needed the freedom to trade on agreed terms upheld by law and eventually, the old order yielded to new ways of doing the nation’s business. This development can’t be underestimated. Whilst the old tribal distinctions prevailed between men and women, in a legal sense these new principles of contract, choice and consent could in theory at least apply to women too. Man’s 10,000 year dominion over womenkind was for the first time weakened by the birth of capitalism. The history since the 18th century has been the history of an economic model, capitalism, delivering abundant wealth with associated inequality but paying for positive social change most often with a big poke from a progressive government.\nThe left would never admit to it but the rights and freedoms all minorities enjoy whether they are women, gay, queer or whatever, they enjoy because they are formed from economic rules that have over 200 years acquired a social character. Marx was the first to recognise this process. No one in the West seriously questions these social rights to contract freely, consent to what happens to you and to choose your lifestyle. However, they may be under threat, and not only because capitalism has morphed into a dark shadow self..the crony controlled “free market”.\nOur ignorance of where our rights come from plus from the Left-wing an open and vitriolic hatred of capitalism and the free market threatens capitalisms enduring legacy of rights. It also threatens the existence of other benefits that accompany them such as our democratic freedoms of conscience and speech. The challenge is, of course, made more acute because capitalism as it was understood when it was forging our rights, no longer exists. It has been replaced by a crony “capitalist” free market economy which has seen employment exported east and low paid workers coming west. There are legitimate reasons to dislike the free market but abolishing economic freedom and replacing it with government ownership will not protect rights. As in the 1970’s it will turn workers against taxpayers!\nThis newly emboldened orthodox Left wing in the UK is starting to erode freedom of conscience and speech within the Labour Party. This arises because they don’t understand why legal principles like contract, choice and consent are essential to maintaining a fair and free society for everyone. Look at countries that have not socialised these economic freedoms and you still find discrimination ie certain parts of Africa. Look at countries who have never had to accept these principles and you have a tyranny ie Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan.\nIf you have state involvement in the economy as we have today it is important that the economy is as free as possible. The importance of economic freedom in legitimising and maintaining social freedoms can’t be underestimated protecting things like gender rights is a function of a free society based on a free economy.\nThe orthodox Left has failed to grasp that whilst economic freedom is bourgeois it must be maintained as it underpins all anti-discrimination policy. This is because people essentially workers or consumers and are therefore able to exercise the same rights whoever they are. The Left’s failure to grasp this makes them fellow travellers with those who oppress others and makes them, and those who support them, a potential threat to our free safe society where everyone now has the same slate of rights.\nIf the Left pursue their 19th-century agenda they will succeed only in throwing the equality baby out with the bourgeois bath water!",

As a result, I wish to formally complain and challenge what seems to be BBC policy adversely affecting the contribution small parties make to Britain’s increasingly rich political tapestry.\nFirstly, I was not accorded a place on the panel of the BBC Radio Lincolnshire husting programme. When I enquired I was told that this was because the party Blue Revolution did not have a national profile. I made the point that it was a local BBC radio station and that as the only ‘other’ candidate and a local person with political experience people might wish to hear my views. Of the six candidates at the election, I was the only one excluded. I was informed it was the executive decision of the Producer from which he was not prepared to depart. I am aware other ‘Independent’ candidates were also excluded from debates in other constituencies in Lincolnshire. I was however interviewed for a recorded piece which I am told will be broadcast during the debate. The programme was postponed to Tuesday 6th May due to the terrible events in Manchester. I was not informed it was going ahead I had been told it had been cancelled, not postponed.\nMy second complaint relates to the Radio 5Live Marginal Mystery Tour which was broadcast from Skegness on 31st May. I found out about this by chance and was disappointed that once again I had not been invited as a local politician with expertise on issues linked to migration and community engagement. It was interesting to note that the UKIP candidate sent a stand in and did not attend in person.\nAs I was canvassing in Skegness that day I attended the venue and spoke to a helpful young production assistant called Jim who made a few calls and eventually I spoke with a more senior member of BBC staff by phone. I was informed that BBC policy excluded me as it is again based on a national party profile. Having decided to resume canvassing I was then called again by Jim who said that they would broadcast a few of minutes of me at around about 12.35. I was in the end given about a minute or so prior to which I had to endure some comic turn by a BBC presenter who implied (please note implied) that I was some ‘numpty’ (his words) who wanted to talk about politics rather than eat ice cream on the beach. The brief interview went well, albeit Blue Revolution being identified with parties like the ‘Fancy Dress party’ I felt was a bit unnecessary. It also seemed to me that the interview was cut short for no obvious reason. The ‘comic turn’ was unnecessary if time was a factor.\nThe points I want the BBC to consider are these. Britain is in danger of having a political system which fails to reflect the diversity of the British population and in its attempt to shoehorn all opinion into ‘established party’ categories the BBC leaves the electorate feeling increasingly alienated and angry. This is precisely why we set up our party Blue Revolution. We believe that the parliamentary system institutionalises two-party politics to such an extent it effectively excludes others. In so doing it reflects the adversarial and increasingly undemocratic nature of politics.\nIn the 21st century, the parliamentary system is becoming incapable of reflecting diverse British views at a level close to the government. Big party and current parliamentary systems effectively lock out of politics different perspectives or new opinion among a wide range of voter. The BBC in the opinion of our Party colluded with this in your treatment of me. The experience of UKIP disappearing locally confirms that the two-party hegemony prevails in an age when it really should not. We are no longer a mono-cultural, monoracial and essentially a two-class based country.\nFurthermore, a constituency election is a race, not a war and therefore there is no justification for publicly funded bodies like the BBC taking sides. Blue Revolution is a serious party with a serious purpose and it is for the electorate to decide on the merits of the message who should win that ‘local’ race, not the BBC. In addition to paying my broadcast licence fee we as a party paid my £500.00 deposit to confirm I am not a frivolous candidate, that is all the BBC needed to consider\nFinally, it is hard enough for a small party to fund and pay for a full one leaflet campaign which comes in at about £1000.00. In addition, there are the costs associated with starting the party in the first place. The situation is more precarious for small parties when the £500 deposit will almost certainly be lost by not gaining the 5% of the vote necessary for its return. The BBC has a critical role here. No one expects a small party to win in what is clearly a rigged two-party system, however by denying local publicity, the BBC makes the loss of the deposit more likely and therefore the future of small parties very precarious. This is something which in our opinion is not good for democracy. The BBC should champion small parties not treat them like an embarrassment to be patronised.\nPlease, can you consider the points above and let me have a response to my complaints. Please, could you also confirm whether you intend to put the issues I have highlighted before the BBC Executive Team and what the outcome of their deliberation was? Do they feel a review of the policy is necessary?\nYours sincerely\nMike Gilbert",

We comment\nThere is alleged bias and there is real bias. The room packed with a certain type of voter is an extreme version of alleged bias the subtly of the nuanced comment a milder and harder to support version of alleged bias. The policy of basing local constituency hustings on who is likely to form a government or the number of candidates a party is fielding nationally is real bias at a constituency level where the law rightly accepts all candidates are of equal merit. This is why the Post Office has to deliver one leaflet free of charge for all candidates and the democratic services team of the local council treats all candidates with equal respect…even independent ones. But this level of objectivity seems not to apply to the BBC where it is blatant and at constituency level, we think illegal bias. You simply can’t as a publicly funded body decide who to air and who not to! But the BBC does and when challenged at production team level the response can be patronising and disheartening.\nEveryone accepts the political ‘system is rigged’ but until we stood in this election it was not clear how aspects of that ‘rigging’ worked. One way it happens is that broadcasters and the media try and shoehorn diverse opinions into a creaky binary 18th-century political system complete with big binary parties of left and right and an electoral system, the first past the post system, that benefits binary politics. The ‘mother of all parliaments’ has given birth to systems like this all over the western world. No wonder from Trump to Corbyn the claim is made that the system fails the people. In the Anglo-Saxon sphere the, parliamentary system is a major contributor to the people’s democratic deficit. Here in the Uk, the BBC contributes too, by gaming their coverage in favour of the main parties and locking out new entrants to politics at constituency level. Add to this the Lobbying by Unions, big business and a picture emerge of a system which was not designed to work in the public’s interest but in the interest of the state and its wealthy supporters. The problem is that unlike in the 18th century where the ordinary person was illiterate had no vote and did not pay taxes now the people have all three! The system needs to change. This election more than any other is likely to see two party politics reinstated and that is bad for democracy and public anger.\nReform of the system is needed but in the case of the BBC this is not just Bias it is in our view an illegal rigging of the system and is one reason why we need a Blue Revolution.",

Old fashioned socialism is premised on the basis that those bad old capitalist need to have their exploitative businesses taken over by the benign state. This is pretty much what happened after WWII. However, the problem became clear by the mid-1970’s the state was bad at running industries and could not do it efficiently and so a programme of sell off’s was embarked on. On the other side of the state equation, the industrial model taken from nationalised industry was deployed to deliver large scale health and education and again it has proved problematic. Local authorities too developed this large scale delivery model with the 1974 reforms. These big delivery models become incapable of adapting and begin to consume resources to maintain themselves rather than deploying resources to the people that need them.\nSo if we end up with a Labour government or some kind of ‘progressive’ alliance will we see a return to the alienating industrial scale delivery of the 1970’s? the evidence seems to suggest that we will and it won’t take long before the whole lot ends up costing more than the country can afford. To understand what to do about this tragic situation we need to understand it’s nature and then develop a new delivery model for the services we need. To do this we need to, first of all, see the country and its people as different from the state, and see the state as a consumer on our behalf. We can then see whether the state as a consumer is costing the country too much and if so whether to use an old Marxist term the state should start to wither away as we develop new delivery models for essential services.

He probably sees himself as a Marxist, a man with a scientific insight into the fundamentals of the misfiring capitalist economy. Except for err…he really isn’t.\nJohn and the assorted collection of shhhhhhhh “Marxists” in the ranks of the Labour party are not Marxists at all. They are socialists and not only that their confused “messaging” reveals that they are not really democratic “socialists” but nasty trolling socialists who would like to use the bourgeois state to take control of the economy and that includes its workers and of course silence dissent. Real Modern Marxists would accept as Marx would have, the bourgeois values of freedom of speech, of conscience, of lifestyle, of contract, choice and consent but reject the bourgeois state which crystalised exploitation and the exclusion of workers from decisions about the economy.\nWhen has the state really represented the workers and promoted worker involvement? Whether it is the 1970’s and the state on behalf of the workers was “running” industries like rail or coal mining or the 1920’s with Lenin’s Russian state “running” industries on behalf of workers, workers never feel particularly empowered.\nSo our “Marxists” as they unashamedly promote, simply want to run the economy under public ownership as though they owned it. This is the tried and tested model of failure we have seen for nearly a century. Our “Marxists” are simply public ownership socialists who tax and spend using debt. Not fully grown up Marxists. Our observations, however, beg a very important question, If McDonnell et al are not Marxists, who is?\nWell, we are nearer to it than any socialist can ever be. We believe in redistribution of wealth but unlike “Marxist” McDonnell we don’t count debt or it’s derivatives in the form of free market profitability as wealth. We don’t see the state as being anything other than a burden on workers who have to pay tax to pay for inefficient waste and an army of bureaucrats meddling in the economy. We believe in worker involvement in the economy and society via a wide legislative structure and not the 18th-century party system.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_sorting-out-the-mess-how-conservatism-and-karl-marx-can-help/content_241.html": "Sorting out the mess, how conservatism and Karl Marx can help.\nKarl Marx as anyone who reads our posts will know was an economic determinist. Even now this is an ‘unfashionable’ theory as it places all ‘ideas’ as the outcome of economic circumstances, including religious and political ideas. Thus, the demands of religion or politics are simply a reflection of how economic value is created and who controls it and disposes of it. Every phase in history to date has been a struggle between those who have amassed economic value (the powerful) and those who created it for them (the poor).\nUntil the seventeenth century, most people were in bondage of one form or another, the birth of capitalism in the eighteenth century took away the overt bonds between the powerful and poor and replaced them with contract, choice and consent. Little changed but in theory at least people were ‘free’. With the end of the feudal system, hard work, luck and a talent for enterprise could turn anyone into a capitalist, even those who had previously been bound to others.\nThe world of the eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was characterised by ‘free’ people winning and losing economically. This economic paradox is what intrigued Karl Marx. Capitalism was a system that was in all senses ‘just’ but was clearly unfair. It was ‘just’ because it was based on Contract, Choice and Consent unlike the values of the feudal system, control, compulsion and coercion but….it was unfair because the elite, the capitalists, made the system work for their benefit. The composition of the capitalist class, unlike that of the aristocracy, changed as economic fortunes changed, but the system was politically robust enough to survive whoever was rich or poor. To preserve itself capitalism created institutions to support it. Political parties, parliaments, Laws and Local Authorities, an established religion and more recently ‘state broadcasters’ all combined to preserve the status quo. After the Second World War two socialist governments of both Labour and the Conservatives sought to extend the rights of contract, choice and consent to as many workers as possible as well as redistribute the economic value more evenly via tax and welfare regimes.\nWell, that story takes us to about 1960. After about 1960 capitalism went into one of its frequent periods of collapse. Capitalism collapses all the time and according to Karl Marx would finally leave a legacy of workers who could both recognise and utilise the principles of contract, choice and consent but within an economic system that was under the control of the workers and not the capitalists. The surplus value that made the capitalists rich would be distributed fairly amongst the working people who created it. The end of unfairness would arise because the people would have economic equality which would generate social equality and a fair income for all. Equality between all people, men, women, and people with a variety of different lifestyles would prevail as there would be no basis for discrimination as everyone’s talents would be needed within an economy of mutual interdependence. We are a long way from this model happening but some of the principles have merit, particularly if applied to the public sector.\nAll models of the economic and social organisation must arise from the base, from the working people who, recognising their equal status as workers only seek to take out of the collective pot an amount that reflects their contribution to the pot with some account taken of their unique needs (having children for example). The mechanism for this is of course contract, choice and consent. A process that both reflects and reinforces equality at every social and economic level; between politicians and people and between the people themselves.\nThe ‘State’ would shrink back and become merely a way of enforcing equality within the Nation and upholding Contract, Choice and Consent. A legal system would be needed not representing ‘capital’ but the sometimes conflicting needs of people within a contractarian society. This would take eighteenth and nineteenth-century capitalist principle into the twenty-first century. But something is preventing that happening.\nThe answer to why t hasn’t happened is complex. The ‘capitalist’ system was designed to protect ‘capital’ amassed by the rich, capital created by the worker. Today we have the ghost of a capitalist system that has collapsed but leaving behind its complex eighteenth-century formal power relationships. So, the good news for the worker is that we have contract, choice and consent welfare and health care. The bad news is the system still requires unequally distributed wealth to function and this is now created by the banking system and the State at large via National Debt and we the working people are paying for an army of rich public servants and a financial and political elite with personal and National Debt.\nBecause the nature of the problem is complex the problem we have in changing this situation is also complex. As working people, we still don’t see ourselves as a mass movement sharing the same values, so we idly identify ourselves with political parties of all stripes that are hostile to our instinctive dislike of the debt-financed political and economic elite. In this sense, the confused socialist and Green party along with the Lib Dems stand for a continuation of the top-down relationship between State and People even though ‘capitalism’ as an economic system requiring a command and control relationships to protect ‘capital’ no longer exists. It’s an oddity that socialism is in Marxist terms still a top-down, command and control ideology, that seeks to reinforce the power of the State and is, in Marxist terms, therefore ‘counter-revolutionary. In that sense Blair, Corbyn and Clinton are all the same. Counter-revolutionaries and the people instinctively know it.\nSo, into this ideological muddle comes the principles of A Blue Revolution. A worker’s revolution that seeks to take the values of our society, contract, choice and consent and use them to form a State that is flatter, cheaper, economically more equal and significantly more democratic and ecologically less harmful.\nThis model won’t be delivered by a socialist type party. Socialism is paternalistic and relies on a powerful State just like top-down religion requires a powerful God to deliver ‘justice’. Socialism is no help to the future, indeed with its top-down obsessions, it is getting in the way of progress.\nSo it leaves either an upsurge in support for A Blue Revolution, which is unlikely in the next two decades or an enlightened Conservative Party to do the Nations bidding and restructure our State along the lines sketched out above. The detail will be more complex but broadly the public sector must be reconfigured so public services like health and police etc are not delivered using industrial top-down hierarchical models with huge wages at the top, which are unreflective of the actual effort put in. We need to develop what we describe as social models to deliver public services.\nSimilarly, the State needs to withdraw from all areas of moral behaviour aside from protecting the vulnerable and allow all adults to ‘contract’ as responsible people. We can no longer afford to subsidize ‘lifestyle’ issues and that must include having children. If people want to have children, they should contract with each other and not simply default to the ‘State’ to pay for them. There is no ‘capitalist’ paying taxes for our welfare, we are all paying for it with our debt. Marriage should be a proper contract and the state should simply ensure a contract exists if people have children, just as it does for a property.\nFinally, our political system is binary to reflect the eighteenth-century obsession with land and capital. Binary systems are prone to failure in the modern world as the two sides coalesce around ‘ideological’ positions and the people get ignored. This has happened too many times to recount but the EU is the most striking example of political failure. We need to change the political system so that people get in who are able and willing to think rather than obey party diktat. If we got rid of parties or rather they got rid of themselves and we had a larger number of politically minded people involved in running our nation we would not need to reform the electoral system. We only need to do that because we have political parties operating within a binary parliament.\nThe revolution may come eventually, but we hope before the debt-dependent free market collapses or the top down cultural Marxists inflict either totalitarianism on the workers or even worse religion takes hold. No one really knows what they the elite are up to. But everything they have done over the last forty years fails the sniff test.",

With walk on parts for God.\nHere at Blue Revolution, we argue that all ideas including religious ones are shaped by economic reality rather than being plucked from the air by prophets or soothsayers. Look at any society at any time in history and there will be patterns and rituals linked to the ‘economic circumstances’ of that society be it a tribal, feudal or a capitalist society. These economic circumstances are formed either by levels of scientific ignorance or scientific discovery and how this influences the way economic value or wealth is created as well as who gets to control that wealth. Essentially all this forms a prevailing ‘ideology’ a belief system if you like, with numerous ideological ‘pretenders’ to challenge it, some more or less credible than others. Socialism has been a challenger to capitalism just as Christianity tried to challenge the world of the first century in the Middle East.\nMuch is made by Christians of the role of Christianity in creating capitalism. This seems at odds with our ‘economic determinism’ as Christianity should be a product of economic circumstances not the originator of them. The Christian message was certainly unusual in the first century but it was utopian and in no sense capable of replacing either the barbarism of the warring tribes from Abraham in the Old Testament to Muhammad and jihad in the seventh century nor the feudalism stirring into life during the same period. Christianity, however, could not have happened had there not been an increase in available wealth to be distributed fairly as described by Christ, or unfairly as happened under feudalism. Christianity was a post-tribal ideology like feudalism but one so passive as to be overwhelmed by barbarism when barbarism resurfaced with Muhammad and jihad in the seventh century.\nThe problem for Christianity was that wealth and the desire to gain control of it created an aggressive patriarchal feudal system. The parable of the loaves and fishes and Christ’s invocation to “render unto Caesar that which is Caesars, render unto God that which is God’s” was not a credible economic ideology given feudalisms economic impulse to control from the top. But along with ‘love thy neighbour’ and ‘turn the other cheek’ Christianity did create an ideology of peace that allowed stability within a warring and fractious region, consolidating feudalism. This Christian inspired passivity allowed for the separation of religion from the economy and State. Which in turn led to prosperity. This prosperity only lasted for about seven hundred years though. It ended with the advance of Islam.\nWithin seven hundred years Islam would by force of arms take the Middle East from relative stability to wars based on banditry, domination and forced conversion to Islam in the name of Allah and all at the point of the sword; jihad. Being an ideology of warfare and enforced submission, Islam’s glorious age only came with its conquest of feudal dominions in the Middle East, all pretty much concluded by the middle ages. This ideology of war and conquest secured the Middle East for the Muslim world and rendered the Jews and Christians second-class citizens in what had once been their prosperous homelands.\nSensing the extinction of Christendom in the late 11th Century Pope Urban sanctioned the Crusades. The Crusades, therefore, were not offensive wars they were defensive wars, an attempt to protect feudal Christendom which had surrendered to Islam’s ideology of warfare and banditry. The crusades failed spectacularly to protect Christendom from Islam.\nThe early economic success of a Christian Middle East fuelled Islamic expansionism. Islam would not have gained any headway had not the economic strength in the region stimulated the Arab tribes to unite under one leader worshipping one God and embark on an ideologically driven programme very much at odds with what had become the relative stability of early feudal ‘Christendom’.\nSo, putting Christianity, the crusades and Islam in an economic context, one needs to see religion as no more than ideology driven by economics with, in the case of Islam, a ‘God’ sanctifying greed and brutality. Whether an ideology takes off as Islam was able to do and Christianity largely failed to do in the Middle East between the seventh and nineteenth centuries, depends upon whether it reflects the economic needs that relate to that time. Christianity being a passive faith derided by Adolf Hitler for its weakness, allowed feudalism to evolve but likewise was powerless to stop Islamic expansionism.\nHaving secured various successful feudal kingdoms and dominions Islam’s doctrinal obsessions saw the end of progressive social and economic evolution in the Middle East. Indeed, such is the capricious notion of the Islamic God that everything ‘evolutionary’ or progressive is a blasphemy, essentially stopping economic development in its tracks. Islam having appropriated feudalism continues to operate this socio-economic model today having nowhere in the world progressed anywhere near democracy. Feudalism in the twenty-first century is politically about as advanced as Islam can become, given its doctrinal demand for control, compulsion and submission. This can be seen in Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nWith Christianity routed in the Middle East, it fared better in Europe where arguably the climate didn’t suit the Islamic warriors and there was little in the way of booty after the retreat of the Romans. Continuing with its ideology of ‘turn the other cheek’ Christianity contributed to the economic success of the western world because, just as it yielded to early feudalism, it was flexible enough to ‘turn the other cheek’ when the juggernaut of scientific discovery and rationality (the Enlightenment) fired up capitalisms engines in the 17th century. By being benign and allowing the economy and State to evolve independently of faith, it allowed progressive social and economic development\nChristianity, therefore, facilitated economic and social progress, unlike Islam it didn’t stop it in its tracks and whilst always two steps behind capitalism (as we would expect as economic determinists) in terms of driving equality, Christianity allowed capitalism to deliver the economic rights to contract, choose and consent that emerged from the Protestant work ethic and become mass industrialisation and then in the twentieth century ‘social justice’. Capitalism has in the subsequent three centuries liberated people within all the nations of the free world. Whilst Christianity has all but faded away. However, just like Christianity in the first century, capitalism is now weak and complacent and has out of cultural ignorance, given the green light to Islamic expansionism. Where this will lead us ‘god’ only knows.",

Just how radical is it or is it both counter factual and counter revolutionary?\nThe world is a messy place these days, methods of ordering society which Karl Marx himself would have called primitive are promoted by the West namely, Saudi Arabia whilst the neurotic adherence to faith which in Marx’s view was put asunder in the 18th century by the growth of capitalism stalks the streets of London and Manchester inflicting death and mayhem on innocent people exercising their long fought for rights to relax and enjoy themselves as individuals free of control by others. This, of course, is precisely what the neurotic Islamists want to destroy. They want to control people by gender, virtue, sexuality, tribe, ethnicity, cast, religion and denomination. There really is no limit to the bubbling primitivism of these groups and their wish to control us and our way of life. It is as though they think the Reformation in the West and what sprang from it namely capitalism and industrialisation should not have happened. This, of course, is also the problem for the British left.\nCapitalism did happen and whilst it exploited the worker financially, creating the proletarian, from the bonded serf, it also created economic freedoms which were necessary for capitalism to function. These legal freedoms eventually took on a social character and explain why we have a generally tolerant, democratic and freedom loving mentality. We sum these freedoms up as Contract, Choice and Consent. They have gone from being almost exclusively the rights for the bourgeoisie to trade to being legal rights that we can all enjoy. Now the British left seems to fail to grasp that there are two sides to the capitalist system, its freedoms and its exploitation.To be just you have to be able to work out how to protect freedom whilst tackling what is still seen by them as exploitation. The British left, however, seems oblivious to this binary capitalist character and thus seem willing to ally themselves with those who hate capitalism or the modern variant the ‘free market’ and hate the freedoms it has created too. In fact, sometimes the leaders of the left seem to be so unsure of their Marx that they think it is Ok to criticise what they call capitalist exploitation with violent language or violent struggle, whilst promising as part of their revolution a mean clunking form of parliamentary redistributive socialism. Corbyn seems like a nice guy but the British hard left rank and file now looks and sounds ugly and turns a blind eye to the kind of discrimination that has no place in a once capitalist now free post-industrial society, namely misogyny and antisemitism.\nAs Marxists, the British hard left are very poor disciples. They are basically Leninists, advocates of bureaucratic central control and state ownership with the freedoms created by capitalism put asunder in the name of a state managed utopian New Jerusalem. To socialists of this stripe, the state itself is everything and the people nothing. These ‘vulgar’ ideas belong somewhere between 1917 and 1973 but please not now we have too much to loose.",

The spectacle of the recent debate was unedifying a slanging match in which the so-called ‘progressives’ ganged up on the hated Tories. It was binary politics at its best. The sad truth is however that the only ‘progressive’ party who will do well on current numbers is Labour and this is because of the electoral system. Once elected though the whole sorry lot will be corralled into the binary politics of the Westminster chamber. This eighteenth-century model forces all shades of opinion into two halves of an argument managed by the party system. The result is that ordinary people feel like observers of an argument the outcome of which will directly affect them but with no ability to contribute to or nuance the outcome.\nPolitical arguments are still being forged by this elderly political system, as they have done since the early 19th century. The difference now is that with diversity increasing, the need for the cooperation of the ordinary person is increasing also. Whilst Labour has made a monumental comeback, the long-term realities are that the binary division in Parliament will continue. Nothing is likely to change the nature of the binary bureaucratic British state and the same old approach will be maintained. With Labour in charge borrowing and spending to ‘invest’ in things for which there will be little obvious return is likely to go up and the challenge will merely be carping from the opposition benches. Corbyn sounds good, he sounds passionate and coherent, the problem is that debt, the weak economic fundamentals, and the cost of the state itself are unlikely to change very much on his watch, but then again he is turning into a man of surprises.",

The status quo being the top down, attack and defend binary system of politics designed in the eighteenth century, which is described as ‘embarrassing’ by a growing army of disillusioned voters.\nThe claim to support minorities referred to above and to promote minority interests fails once you stray into politics. This is when the BBC shows its true ‘state broadcaster’ credentials. It will subtly overlook some political groups whilst almost embarrassingly falling over themselves to promote others. The flim flam of their ‘policy documents’ allows them to justify whatever they do to whomsoever they need to justify it, and that is usually just to themselves.\nTwo cases in point. In 2017 a small group of people started a political group called Blue Revolution. The idea came to us because it was clear the political system was stale, elitist, and failing to deliver policies that benefitted working people financially. Debt was the ‘money supply’ and rich few were getting richer whilst they systematically ‘fleeced’ the many. As a business model this aligns perfectly with the licence fee-based BBC funding model. 2017 was the year of Theresa May’s ill judged General Election and having only existed for a Month ‘Blue Revolution’ felt compelled to field a candidate.\nThe BBC Radio 5 Live team came to Skegness for a constituency visit with Emma Barnet and an unfunny Irish comedian and placed their caravan adjacent to the beach. Blue Revolution, one of only five candidates standing in that constituency were not invited to participate in the seaside discussion. However, there was a ‘stand in’ for the Ukip candidate representing Paul Nuttal the then Ukip leader. Why go to a constituency and base your choice of interviewees on the established parties? Why not see what else is out there at a grass roots political level? Why not examine the views of political minorities? Because the BBC is the broadcaster of the British State, and the British State wants to maintain the political status quo. Anyone struggling to be hard or more over questioning the legitimacy of party based, top down, attack and defend parliamentary politics is not given a voice. Subsequently the Blue Revolution candidate was invited to chat to Emma Barnet. But it was clearly just intended to be a piss-take. Without his consent decreed that he was to become mere entertainment, rather than to inform. A subsequent complaint resulted is the usual self-justifying BBC waffle.\nRoll onto 2023 and the public’s appetite for alternative ideas to the ‘embarrassing’ status quo has increased. Blue Revolution has fought council seats and is gaining an increasing vote share, whilst steadfastly observing the principle that a formal party structure is bad for democracy. It’s a slow burn process getting candidates elected as there can be no central ’command and control’ structure beloved of mainstream parties and some ‘independent’ groups.\nHowever, in 2023 Blue Revolution fielded eight candidates in the May elections. This made the group the third largest after the new Boston Independents Party and the Conservatives. Blue Revolution ran a good campaign as eight independents under the same banner. Blue Revolution increased its vote share and managed to get a councillor elected. However, it received absolutely no coverage from the BBC unlike the new Boston Independent Party. This no coverage even extended to no reference to the group name. This resulted in the name Blue Revolution being omitted from the BBC website detailing the final council results. Which then failed to be referenced on Wikipedia. It thus gives a false picture of Boston’s political history. You don’t need the Russians to interfered in elections when you have the BBC.\nThe BBC is an outdated institution. A throwback to power based analogue politics but in a new less tired digital age.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_is-the-states-love-in-with-the-financial-sector-the-nations-biggest-threat-we-consider-the-question/content_295.html": "Is the State’s love-in with the financial sector the Nation’s biggest threat? We consider the question.\nBoth main parties have big flaws in their understanding of the landscape of modern economics. This impedes their ability to formulate policies which will empower the working class and lift our nation out of its current diminished, debt dependent and low productive state.\nWe have done some work on exposing Labour’s 19th and 20th-century parochial simplicities in the face of massive global forces. Now a short but productive journey in Lincolnshire gives us a chance to explore the 21st-century failings of the State and its lazy wizard of Oz-like economics.\nSomewhere between Louth and Lincoln in the UK, there is a field on the outskirts of a small town. A large Estate Agents board proclaims “development opportunity/shops/hotel/restaurant”. Nothing too sinister about this of course except that developments like the one proposed here are what has replaced a “real” economy of production, extraction and manufacture which used to support the financial and other sectors. The “productive” energy of the modern economy is the financial sector. The Tories claim that penalising the financial sector will reduce the number of “good jobs”. That may be true.\nHowever if “good jobs” depend on financial engineering as opposed to real engineering then this might be a sacrifice worth making in the short to medium term. These are the kinds of discussions governments should be having with their people as whatever happens real people will be more affected than governments.\nThe economic model upon which our current ‘growth’ is based is a throwback to Blair and Brown in the UK and in the US the Clinton and “W” Bush years.\nThis economic model has been described as “post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory”. Essentially the government spends money to stimulate economic growth, investing in education, the public sector and infrastructure projects. To fund this programme governments borrow. To give its early political advocates credit they did believe it would stimulate economic growth. What they failed to grasp was the link between ‘growth’ and personal and government debt, and the global context within which all this borrowing was going on!\nFor desperate politicians who had collapsing ‘real’ economies, post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory offered the tonic the nation needed. The “cool Britannia” hubris was a reflection of nieve certainty this was the end of “boom and bust”.\nAmerica was ahead of the game on the same diet of debt based stimulation. Clinton and his economists also allowed such a poor framework of regulation, adopted in the UK that banks were printing millions of dollars to lend to subprime borrowers who were like an x-factor wannabe convinced they were millionaires in the making. All it needed was a lot of borrowed cash plus that blend of skills that can only be honed eating in fast food outlets and dreaming in front of the mirror and everyone could be a winner! The bankers got the commission, as the whole system shuffled towards collapse.\nWe all know the fallout both sides of the Atlantic. The banking crisis of 207/8 and bank bailouts to keep the economy alive and supplied with debt or rather liquidity and demand. How did we all end up here?\nIn simplistic terms, the financial sector in the 1980’s went from being a petit-bourgeois servant of the economy to its very effective master and by the 2000’s was effectively in control of the global economy. The success of financial sector engineering has prevented the collapse of the economies of the Western world due to its ability to mix asset value inflation, debt and confidence in an ever-expanding and planet consuming vortex of consumption and waste.\nThis is the world we live in today, cars, jobs, houses, holidays, gadgets and consumables. This model forged on the 1980’s hasn’t changed at all. Governments borrow and it flows into the domestic and the global markets, students borrow and after a brief sojourn in the UK it flows into the global markets. People borrow and it flows into global markets. The bigger the government the more it can borrow hence the markets love of the EU and the market’s seduction of the “Remainers”. The EU is a big beast of borrowing.\nSo what has this to do with a field in Lincolnshire, this borrowing and spending, “Alice in Wonderland” economic model?\nWell, our farmland will give up producing food value and be sold creating wealth as the farmer makes money from the land as opposed to off the land. This he or she will bank helping bank profitability. They will also spend it, perhaps abroad, maintaining a bit of the aggregate demand the system needs whilst also fuelling the global markets.\nBefore the farmers gain in banked, a bank will lend money to a borrower so they can buy and develop the land. This will allow a business to be constructed in bricks and mortar employing local tradespeople and service sector workers. The business will achieve profitability allowing debt to be serviced and taxation paid. Its existence in a small town may possibly force the closure of other similar businesses putting those properties back on the open market, so the financial sector can turn the crank again, releasing more equity perhaps. Debt from elsewhere in the economy (government borrowing transformed into public sector wages for example) will provide the demand for this business and its profits will be taxed to benefit the government.\nWhat has gone on here? Well just like in the 2000’s nothing very much. Some confidence based financial jiggery-pokery has allowed some land to be equity released, making a farmer very rich. Debt is used to build and run a business employing people and debt makes it profitable. Oh and according to the Conservatives this process creates “high-quality jobs” which is probably correct in the financial and construction sectors. This whole process is going on all over Europe, America and the West in general and it has nothing to do with creating real economic value. We know it is a caricature, but we believe it is broadly right.\nThe question for us all is; where does this “economy” finally end and what will the world look like when it does end up somewhere? A planet exhausted by pollution and ecological abuse. A western population who have come to rely on ecological destruction to maintain a lifestyle of debt and alienation. Cultures of faith or ideological simplicity may be ready to step in and force the return of humankind to a sustainable but gender binary harsh and essentially by modern standards abusive existence.

It could stand for policy confusion, political censorship, psychological conditioning, or it could stand for proceed cautiously or it could stand for all four.\nAs economic determinists we believe we understand the urge for political correctness-after all we are more equal and deserving of respect. So it somehow feels right for the “PC brigade” to stand up for minorities. However whilst the historical process of tearing us away from tribe or feudal overlord is in the western world almost over, the process of achieving this was a legacy of capitalism. Capitalism’s need to establish bourgeois values like freedom based on contract, choice and consent meant that speech or thought, or expression should not be subject to illegitimate control as they had been in the centuries preceding the late 17th century. No wonder the hard left hate these values, they are after all bourgeois.\nBut bourgeois values are not the same as bourgeois institutions which (with the exception of the constitutional monarchy) the hard left want to maintain. They misunderstand the fundamental difference between bourgeois values and bourgeois institutions and they thus misunderstand how corrosive PC is to our bourgeois values and in particular freedom of speech and freedom of thought.\nThe bourgeois origins of our freedoms should not be used to dismiss their importance to us now. When we try to protect the more vulnerable members of our communities with PC values that strike before even the law can intervene, we are behaving in a pre bourgeois, and thus also a pre socialist and pre freedom way (socialism is capitalism’s first born!). The problem with PC is that it is essentially about protection from being “offended”. To the shiny new Oxbridge undergraduate who is excited about protecting the trans community or the disabled, PC isn’t seen as a justification for control. But it is just that. It is a means by which bourgeois values of freedom, including freedom of speech can be brought under someone’s control. With Political Correctness we are back in the pre capitalist world of illegitimate authority and control over thoughts and expression, control over ideas and behaviour. Control over who can think what and why.\nTo put this into some kind of perspective imagine if, after we had accepted that the bourgeois notion of “freedom of speech” could be compromised to avoid causing offence we were faced with a growing demand from people who felt “offended” about shaking a woman’s hand and demanded more segregation. Or people “offended” about unmarried parents and demanded controls on behaviour to prevent “illegitimate” children. We would be back in the 16th century.\nOnce you protect from “offence” where do you stop. In such situations as above the progressive legacy of our 18th century bourgeois revolution would have been squandered and progressive thinking reversed on the altar of trying to be nice and not offend.\nTo avoid a calamitous waste of three hundred years of bloodshed and social evolution we should all grow up, grow a thicker skin and continue to evolve as a species rather than return to an earlier simpler world where we are told what to think based on factors such as our gender, social position, race or sexuality. We no longer want people to know their place unless we are a hard left neandertal in which case we actually do. So with PC we say proceed with caution or simply abandon the project altogether.",

Serried ranks of party hacks all having one eye on their careers and the other eye on the opposition party’s activities, whilst the rest of us are ignored or “managed” to ensure the various right and left vested interests are protected and promoted. It is easy to see why people can be beguiled by politicians, and their parties, because the only way onto politics is via one. But being part of a party requires a certain amount of abandoning of principles and promoting “groups” who are sympathetic with the party in question.\nStudents are a case in point. Student debt keeps the left wing educational establishment in work whilst transferring wealth from poor families to universities either as government debt (paid for out of taxation) or student loans. Other examples are the future pauperisation of the future young via payments for elderly care out of the elderly’s current wealth. How long before the State decides that in addition to covering elderly care out of inheritable wealth student loans can be paid out of actual inherited wealth. The State and its new industries like elderly care, education, child welfare, domestic abuse and crime all need paying for and tax can and will only go so far.\nYoung people should realise that socialists just want to turn the state into the Nation’s employer of choice for well…. left wing intellectual people who have no connection with the real working class. The bill of course is picked up by the poor old workers. The Conservatives want to do the right thing but in a system that can’t and has rarely ever delivered the “right thing”. They will and currently are doomed to fail. Corbyn is right about that.\nWe offer this warning to the young and old alike; just remember that your interests and the interests of the planet are not aligned with the interests of the State. The State is an 18th century institution designed to prevent civil war and to manage opposition using a crude binary model of government and opposition. In the two or three hundred years it has existed in its modern form it has done well to promote vested interests on left and right. Those interests are no more about ordinary people’s interests now than they have ever have been before.\nSocialism and Corbyn’s “left” are as much part of the State as they are unashamedly about “the Labour Party”and its 1840’s values. They are “socialists”. Socialism is not about liberating the people it is about the party, and delivering the Party’s programme.\nOnly Blue revolution wants to bring together ordinary people in a new politics for the 21st century and re build Britain from the neighbourhood up! Not Parliament down.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_blue-revolution-archive-10-02-15-to-03-05-15/content_374.html": "Blue Revolution Archive 10.02.15 to 03.05.15\n10.02 15 Why Tolerance Should Give Way To Acceptance\nWhy acceptance rather than tolerance? Well tolerance is a term used in engineering and refers to the amount of pressure or strain a material can take before its yields and bends or breaks. It might have been a word that could be applied to any society which is strong morally like a steel girder, stressed only by modest weight, as we in the west once were. However with more and more pressure applied the weight gets too much and the consequences of too much tolerance becomes collapse. It is therefore not a word which works well in a world where we are no longer that steel girder and our tolerance is too often at breaking point as the pressure gets greater. The breaking point is the problem as is the build up of the pressure.\nAcceptance fits better into our modern global scenario; for we accept many things and many faiths but we should not accept everything. We should not stand by silently like the steel girder being put under more and more weight until it fractures while injustice is all around us. We must be outspoken about what we are prepared to accept, and as importantly, what we don’t accept. There has to be a movement of people who across the globe say that they accept all faiths and none but they cannot accept injustice, cruelty or to be terrorized by anyone of whatever faith.\nSo why do we need to develop a concept of acceptance? It is because tolerance has failed to deliver stability. We acquiesce too much and burden ourselves with numerous untold problems due to our tradition of tolerance.\nAll faiths have at their heart the desire to preserve those who accept whatever faith. Mankind has always, out of necessity, sought to survive within different tribes or groups with their own single moral code and single moral purpose; all different but with one aim preservation: Tribes become kingdoms, kingdoms become nations and nations become empires. Eventually empires morally and economically over extended, decline, a process through which we are living now in the 21st century as the empire of the west seems likely to have entered its final century, the consequence of which is an unimaginable horror for those who believe in Choice and Consent.\nWhether tribe or empire the purpose is the same; to deploy a unique morality to deliver us from contingency and fear and to create value to enable our survival. The challenge comes in who controls that value or as it is better but inaccurately known wealth. Who controls the value is a political issue but its creation relies on people adhering to a particular faith. This is why we have all faiths and none, because essentially faith speaks of human survival through the creation of value.We may not like the culture of others or the faiths from which those cultures evolve but we must accept their reality and view of the world and challenge them through peace and open dialogue if the faith is being used to harm others or is failing to recognize their rights. We must not tolerate harm, but accept the reasons why that harm might be legitimised and challenge bravely that which we don’t accept.\nSo why is this approach of acceptance so relevant now. Firstly lets assume the British and American empires are simply the empires of the western world; with the decline of empire there is a consequential loss of its moral purpose and a self-indulgent aimlessness sets in based on the past rather than the future; a reaction to which is to impotently impose the will of the empire on those it fears. And this sadly when there is neither the vision, the resources nor the necessity to do so. The resultant chaos exposes the weakness of the old empire and that weakness invigorates a new tribalism which thrives intent on replacing the old empires with its perceived lack of moral purpose with a new moral empire. Unfortunately, the old empire’s attempt to impose its values by force creates the chaos that leads to the very contingency and fear mankind has spent tens of thousands of years trying to escape. It thus forces those destroyed communities into having to accept a new simple moral purpose if only as a means of survival. This is understandable but not acceptable. Arguably the west has provided a fertile environment for ISIS by causing chaos in the middle east. Tribalism returns out of necessity.\nIn our inner cities in the west we have criminal gangs and fanatics who traffic, enslave and kill whilst the authorities are impotent to control or fully understand these groups or their behaviour. This is the re-establishing of the tribal mindset within our culture. These groups can thrive because they have a simple philosophy and simple moral purpose; to survive by preserving the leadership who in turn preserves the minions. But it is a survival where the individual, long considered to be of moral worth in the west, is accorded no value at all. This is the paradox of liberalism, horror and abuse of people exists because the ability and willingness to challenge it has been muted by a confused tolerance which lasts until the tolerance gives way and wars are waged and cultures destroyed.\nAt an international level the actions of the old empire in seeking to impose “democracy” or “freedom” on its adversaries unleashes tribal instincts which attach themselves to religion and reek havoc across huge swathes of the world taking advantage of the inability of the declining empire to maintain its grip or moral purpose .\nTo stop this madness people of all faiths and none, must understand the problem of too much tolerance; the pressure, fear and chaos it creates when it breaks down and counter its seduction with a new vision of acceptance or indeed non acceptance expressed confidently. With a belief in acceptance, non acceptance and peace we must show solidarity with all peoples and all faiths by promoting peace through acceptance and where tensions exist we must engage in healthy disagreement.\nPolitics like faith has to enter the 21 century, if that is, we want to see the rights of all individuals respected and preserved all over the world as lasting legacy of the influence of the west on world culture. In two hundred years there may be little of the Western empire left; but it is essential that its legacy of the rights of individuals to speak and be heard is preserved regardless of race gender, sexuality or faith and as humans in whatever groups we find ourselves we must never again be subject to the whim of the tribe mentality or the brutal overlord.\n17.02.15 Faith and sensitivity\nThe recent criminal violence carried out in France against Charlie Hebdo, in Denmark yesterday (14/02/15) and Australia by people claiming to represent the Islamic faith, highlights serious issues on both sides of the troubled freedom of speech debate. In the West, we fail to see our own role in fuelling this violent criminality by challenging a faith that is understandable but ideologically much less able to view challenge in any terms other than as a threat to its existence. To any ideologically simple and unforgiving moral code, any threat is existential and requires a violent and uncompromising response. The reason for this is that faith was in the past and for some still is mankind’s response to the fear of being thrown back into chaos and contingency. If faith is threatened, therefore, for some people the response is going to be severe. This is not how it should be……but it is how it is.\nIn addition to the threat to the faithful presented by the direct challenge to the sensibilities of the Islamic faith such as cartoon depiction of the Prophet Mohammed; our lifestyle in the west is, in itself, a challenge.\nWe need to look at our own behaviour, the behaviour that challenges those of faith and some of no faith, for example our inability to manage within coherent family units without the collective misery of divorce or separation our reliance on single parenthood as a promoted family context within which to bring up children, our welfare system subsidising poor moral behaviour, consumption as a national preoccupation, celebrity culture and so on and so forth.\nAll this adds to the yawning gulf between the secular world and those of faith but particularly Islam. The West borrows and spends with little obvious moral purpose, other than maintain its pre-eminent global position; this is an unsustainable situation and the criminals who operate in the name of Islam know this. We need to look at both sides of the violence from and against Islamic groups and turn the war into a war of words. We cannot allow chaos to prevail as in chaos only unforgiving Islamism could survive with its brutality; something we have not yet come to recognise.\n24.02.15 East and West -morality in a conflicted world\nOver the last two weeks, we have explained our view that the lack of moral purpose in the West has contributed to the anxiety aroused in people of the Muslim and other faiths. This issue results in widespread fear and contributes to the rivalry among faiths and therefore their competing moral systems. Rivalry generally plays an enormous part in fuelling an unstable world and, in our opinion, a strong moral code based on peace will help overcome this rivalry, securing a stable world in which our children can safely grow up.\nAll moral codes are intended to preserve their different cultures from mankind’s past horror of contingency and the inability to create value to support and nourish people. Mix too many cultures together without a strong overarching “meta” value system (such as existed in the past with the Empires of Britain and the US stabilising Europe after the Second World war) and the existential anxiety will trigger violence to an extreme point. This is where we are now.\nOur own intervention in the Middle East has only made the situation worse; by exposing the problem. Where there were once dictatorships holding down the violent impulses of different groups, we now have an understandable explosion of chaos in the Middle East: the imposition of “faith” based violence and aggression a symptom of this chaos. However, whilst the faith-based violence is the action of criminals, there is little chance of these fanatical groups imposing enough mature order on the areas conquered to allow their subjugated communities to create the value necessary to thrive and survive. They simply enact barbaric and pointless acts of murder reinforcing chaos thus recreating the fear and contingency mankind has been running away from for many millennia. To be progressive you need stability, to be properly regressive you need to create chaos, or have oil wealth necessary to subdue people and to police your repressive regime…\nIn certain sections of the media, there is an odd reaction to some these barbaric regressive banalities. There seems to be a conflicted position in which some people see the criminals in the Middle East as somehow both perpetrators of violence against innocent victims but also simultaneously victims themselves. Seeing oneself as a victim as do Islamic State is the response of a group that wants to gain control sucking in followers and resources. Being treated like a victim is the way the powerful gain control of us. To some extent our desire in the West to tolerate the despots of the Middle East (and later declare war on some of them) has led certain commentators to the view that, not only is the violence due to the West but the military machine of the West and mainly the US is to blame for the victimhood of a whole faith group in the region. Hating the US appears to offer justification for treating the criminals of the Middle East as though they are genuine victims. The West is not the cause of the violence but has, instead, provided by sheer incompetence the context: the chaos in which the criminals thrive.\nSeeing victimhood as a virtue has for a long time been a problematic perspective offering little hope of betterment like the peasants of mediaeval Europe and the intergenerational unemployed in the UK today. It is a tool for control or controlling. For the survival of the real victims, the intervention of a greater force for good is required. For some commentators, the further intervention of the West sorting out the mess we have made in the Middle East is worse than allowing the greater force to come from the criminal militants themselves.\nWith no power going in to sort out the mess and I don’t mean the West, nothing will happen and the serious risk is that the criminal militants will not stop harming until someone comes along and stops them. This must happen the failure to act will simply enslave and degrade millions of innocents. Starting with Christians, gay people and other non-conformists.\nIf international socialism were still a viable option then I’m sure some would have supported that intervention, but it too would simply have done what the despots were doing for years: holding the lid down. The answer has to be to understand how the progress of the western world through the application of more and more skilful and technological means of production, has largely left the Middle East in a kind economic slow lane. In the West, we have developed our market-based capitalist system which has come to respect the right to trade and contract, move freely with goods and services so maximising personal choice. We accept that within this context, freedom of speech and faith are important parts of the deal. The only other issue one of personal concern is one’s own moral behaviour – helping to provide an environment within which one contracts one’s labour and manages one’s affairs so as to avoid depending on others and to contribute to the greater good. Contract, choice and consent are the economic outcomes from the maturing of the free market system giving rise to freedom of speech etc. They became pillars of our culture and benefit us all. Within this moral and economic context, we all created value and avoided contingency, uncertainty and fear whilst also giving rise to the demand for democracy. Sadly, in the late 21st century, many of us have lost the ability to function in a broadly moral way. Relationship issues, tax avoidance, greed, immodesty etc have taken hold. The cultural pillars described above worked because of our personal moral framework. They were designed to work in sympathy with society’s widest interests.\nTherefore, to fully understand what has been going wrong in the Middle East and the West we must draw upon our knowledge of history, philosophy and psychology.\nEssentially, the Middle Eastern societies that were, in the past, beacons of science, art and enlightenment, have slipped backwards as a result of their communities failure to become engines of their own progress through capitalism and the free market. The process of turning the trapped retainer into the contracted worker and expanding the number of opportunities that this would have provided, never really occurred and, indeed, with the discovery of oil, the need to do this – to achieve the economic value needed for supporting populations – became unnecessary. The oldest form of fascism too; man’s dominion over womankind has also in varying degrees held back progress, making families little autocracies rather than working partnerships. Thus, the situation we are all in now is that many countries in the Middle East were wealthy enough to become self-sufficient due to oil and open up opportunities for their people. However, they were unfortunately so politically unsophisticated to the extent that they fell prey to dictators who wanted complete control of oil value to create personal wealth Saddam; Gaddafi etc\nReligion in this situation becomes the conduit through which revolution was being fought, and these revolutionaries were suppressed. The ensuing tussle, resentment and the demand for change (which the West muddle-headedly interpreted as a clamour for democracy) ultimately became the justification for war.\nThe West needs to accept that the “Western Democratic Model” is probably not going to get established in the Middle East anytime soon, the value base does not accept individual rights, but acceptance of others could be a good place to start to make progress. Perhaps for a decade or so a better model would be along the lines of a ‘scrutiny’ of the dictators to ensure that very basic human rights are observed, a kind of Magna Carta. The EU could easily take on this function to ensure that places like Syria, no less undemocratic in the immediate future though they might be, are upholding very basic human rights. The drift towards opening markets and trade could then stimulate other market type phenomena such as consumer choice, consent and contract. This could be the basis for social and personal arrangements becoming more liberal and the movement towards democracy might take hold.\nWe in the West also need to make significant changes to the way in which we lead our lives so as to avoid undermining our own culture. As I mentioned above, we have lost much of our moral purpose. In many cases, our personal conduct works against the interests of others and society at large. We could look for inspiration to other, more ‘faith-based’ moral codes. For example, we did at one time find in the Middle East an approach to life that was designed to coherently hold society together to avoid contingency and fear. Unfortunately, it has been corrupted by despots, oil and war. Fostering social order creates value and enables us to create wealth, meaning we can provide for ourselves and our families and safeguard our society and its rights.\nIf we choose not to do this we risk exacerbating our differences (particularly with Islam) and ushering in a long period of escalating violence. The likelihood of the Western powers and Western people doing this is not exactly likely due to the fact that we would have to reduce our consumption and behave in a more moral way, avoiding many of the lifestyle choices we have come to expect as normal at every social level. The issue for us has a lot to do with the relationship between Companies, the Government and the taxpayer. More of this, later.\n03.03.15 The role of the faithful supporting those in need\nA slight digression from the usual stuff about morality in a globalised world with something closer to home. It is a real sign of the quiet convergence of various faiths that they see the common purpose helping the poor and those in need here in the UK. There are food banks run on behalf of church charities as well as Muslim groups in Bradford and Sikh faith groups e.g. in London who offer support to others of all faiths and no faith. We have made the point in earlier postings that the west has lost its moral purpose, which undermines its economic and social purposes; this can be partly explained by the trend for expecting governments to take over the roles within communities that are the proper stuff of charities and the communities themselves; yes there is clearly a role for government, but groups who offer a model of clear help with moral expectations, as opposed to entitlements will provide a stronger basis for future progress for those who find themselves in need of help.\nWe all have to do what we can to add value to our lives and the lives of others by what we say and what we do. The opportunities granted to us by out liberal democracy should not be undermined by adopting an overly liberal approach to anything which essentially undermines everything. This happens because in the hands of a bureaucracy people fail to develop a sense of obligation to other human beings, lacking empathy and commitment to do more than wait for the next government payment to arrive. Faith groups and some secular charities seem to understand this approach better than governments and with their intersession, a sense of positive expectation can be fostered. Understanding the links between charitable relief, the role of the family ….so important to people of faith, and self-help will bring people of all faiths and no faith together and secure a more positive future for all who need assistance. In addition, the social and economic functions of society are enhanced by the role of faith and charity. People are helped to become more functional and socially and economically active. Even in the early days of faith and religion; the role of getting the dispossessed faithful back into alignment with the larger community fell to the religious groups through charity. Back then, however (as is the case in some parts of the world today) the faithless are not considered worthy of support and harsh and brutal punishment was administered. Today we have a more accepting approach which does not judge others because we don’t have to judge them. The poor are not a threat to our society.\nTo many, this idea of a charity supporting the poor will seem like abandoning the poor to the modern workhouse. We disagree. We do not advocate the end of the government’s role in welfare just the greater role for faith and charitable groups. There is no institution advocated here, no four walls, just a caring community that expects everyone to do whatever they are capable of doing to add to the common good. This avoids the poor becoming ghettoized, marginalized and thereafter despised and ignored. It brings them back into the community as visible contributing people. Anyone can add value, adding value is not the same as wealth, many activities create social if not economic value; tidying the community and fostering children add value, selling shares simply creates wealth.\n14.03.15 What is faith for?\nSo far, we have attempted to explain our simple theory that all faiths and some beliefs that involve no religious faith have in the past played a crucial role in mankind’s development. Faith was the means by which we became functioning social units bounded by a common sense of purpose. The common purpose being to work to avoid what we call “contingency” but which perhaps is better understood as uncertainty and thereby to increase the chances of survival by productive activity. Productive activity creating the value which enabled our forebears to survive.\nWho did what in the family was an important component of this process. The better we became at controlling our environment the more value we created and the better able we were to survive. Faith was the kingpin to this wonderful process. It has to be accepted that the rules applied to society by different faiths particularly if you head way back to the past were in too many ways discriminating, they met the needs of those societies they related to at that time. However, the value created by society was often taken by the powerful and denied to those who created it. We should not, however, judge these societies on our terms; we would not have had the progress we have had since we emerged from a state of living on our instincts into one based on consciousness, had we remained a fearful group of suspicious small tribe hunter-gatherers. Faith gave mankind coherence and ensured our survival.\nFaith, therefore, was an essential component of our survival as a species…it is clearly Darwinian in its importance. However what relevance has faith now? To answer this, we need to look in more detail at what faith did for us in the past and ask are we better off without it or should we try and return to some of the basic truths contained within the faiths of our past.\nIt is important to clarify from the beginning that the way faith was used in the past to control people and enable our survival, had a historical context; so, for example, some current “faith” based societies have fetishized certain old faith-based practices. Stoning, flogging, and amputation may have been an absolute necessity in a world of fear, starvation, and uncertainty but today it is just a weird abuse of human life almost but not exactly turning human suffering and death into a spectator sport. We are not, therefore, going to even start to suggest that any faith should promote a return to that kind of thing. In fact, as the criminals of ISIS will discover it is not possible to avoid contingency crisis, fear, uncertainty, and anxiety when you are the cause of it. In situations like this people will not be able to create value and so eventual decline and slow extinction with follow on. Without oil, Saudi Arabia would have been extinct decades ago.\nWe have a good reason for saying that we no longer require draconian culture propped up by draconian faith. The reason being that we are no longer in fear of our old enemies contingency and uncertainty and therefore have developed the capacity to create value (or in the case of Saudi Arabia pump it out of the ground) without in reality having the fear that dissenters from faith will cause some kind of cataclysmic social catastrophe. The same thing does not apply to the criminals of ISIS. These throwbacks to a past age of fear and uncertainty have little if any chance of using their “faith” or criminal incompetence to create the kind of social and economic value which provides security for their children and the communities they control. They are quite simply not up to the job of building a modern nation. But as I will go on to suggest, neither are we in the west.\nWe in the west need to take a long hard look at our “culture” with its ludicrous idolatry of celebrity and pornography, our shallow obligations to one another causing mental illness on a grand scale and our requirement particularly in the UK to be paid for anything we do stripping it of all social value and rendering it merely wealth creating. The culture of welfare turning socialism into the new “opium of the people” is a new and emerging challenge and all this straddled by politicians who I honestly believe can’t see the cultural wood from the economic trees.\nWe are therefore in danger of inciting a cataclysmic clash of cultures; Faith groups but particularly Islam being fuelled by a legitimate and credible dislike of the self-destructive “culture” of the west; whilst the west blind to the obvious causes of Islam’s objections to our culture sees Islam as an existential threat. For the west, the debate becomes laughable, about Islam’s dislike of democracy and freedom. So this justifies regime change and more chaos. Hmm seems like Armageddon is almost unavoidable.\nTo bring all faiths together and create peace through acceptance we need to start to get a debate going in the west about the west. Understand Islam and all the stuff it does but contextualised it in terms of the role of all faith in all cultures. Then once we have started to sort ourselves out we can start to comment on the modern role of Islam in a world of IT, equality, contract, choice and democracy.\nIn our next post we comment on how in the west we have unwittingly recreated fear and uncertainty on a very personal level.\n15.03.15 Sorting out a moral/social/ economic problem the western way!\nWe have commented that in the west we have issues to address and by making the simple assumption the world’s problems lie elsewhere (Russia the middle East, Africa) we are being dishonest with ourselves.\nOur reaction is particularly hazardous if we fail to grasp what is really behind all faith communities’ concerns about western culture and some nonfaith groups too. Most particularly the problems we in the west must confront exist largely on a personal level rather than a political level, so it is easy to convince ourselves that everything is all right “in general”. Politicians, some established Church people and those with a stake in the status quo, can have no basis for considering anything is wrong.\nAgain, it is important to show understanding of their lack of concern, but be critical none-the-less. The reason they seem ambivalent whether police, politicians or civil servants is quite simple; social issues don’t really touch them or if they do the consequences for them can be mitigated by higher income and a higher social position. Or they are employed to try and tackle the problem, unaware that it is the flaws in our “liberal tolerant” society that cause the problems in the first place.\nIn the past faith helped mankind by bringing certainty to people’s worlds even if that certainty had cruel dimensions. Today in the west for our most vulnerable people there is little personal certainty and therefore little capacity to create value social or economic.\nTake the issue of teenage sexual exploitation. Most commentators, politicians and the police have now concluded that the fault lies with the abusers not the abused. The line here is agencies failed to react to evidence of abuse due to cultural sensitivities (since when has crime been excused based on cultural sensitivities…? Oh yes quite often; Domestic Violence, animal cruelty, FGM and so on and so forth). The major issue, however, was that within this situation there has been a clash of cultures which sadly characterises the conflicts of culture we have tried to outline in earlier posts. We have males who culturally have come to expect high moral standards from females (the woman is the citadel of Islam).\nThe Islamic faith places women behaviour on a high pedestal but like all high pedestals it will be a hard landing if you fall off, and the girls at the centre of the abuse had fallen off and their hard landing was to become viewed as their worthlessness. Now, this situation was made worse by the fact that the males and agencies who should have been protective took a similar view to the abusers; the girls were out of control etc. Which I can accept is possibly true, but is no justification for the abuse they experienced; their lives should never have been seen as worthless.\nSo, we have a toxic moral mixture which in many respects reflects the wider conflicts between of western and other cultures as seen by many faith groups and this includes Islam. Like all generalisations, there is a degree of truth within it.\nWe are sexually preoccupied and ambivalent about it. We see many others lives as worthless rather than as a reflection of the grace of their God. We have a low tolerance for the spiritual needs of others and rely on the government to step in. This is seen in many areas of society, but particularly in our past muddled response to the crisis of abused children. The states response to child abuse; lessons in consent for children!\nLessons in consent should be unnecessary in a culture where people (adults) take the time to get to know each other properly and respect each other as individuals, rather than categorising each other based on looks or affluence as young people are now tending to do. Young people learn from the adults around them and develop toxic values which leave them open to abuse.\nYoung people should see their lives as more than their outward bodily appearance and should avoid obsessing about what they could to with the physical gifts of nature bestowed on them. They should avoid benefiting themselves rather than benefitting others. Children should not be made to feel it is necessary to give or refuse consent; this path like every other “western cultural solution” has the seeds of a major disaster ticking away in its DNA.\nConsent for illegal behaviour should not be given by a child in a healthy culture, but if given by a child, encouraged by the system to exercise what should be an adult right, it will be on the basis a sad desire to be wanted; it’s a predatory charter. Once consent is given there is no “cooling off period”. Whoever dreamed up this idea for dealing with Child Sexual Exploitation should be subject to close scrutiny because as ideas go it is utterly appalling. But it reflects we suppose an utterly appalling society.\nGirls need to be raised in loving homes within a family that loves them for who they are. The adult male should be (wherever possible) the actual biological father.\nBoth should take the time to exercise choice and consent before settling down to have children and cooperate as equals in their daughter’s upbringing; even if this includes a parent staying at home to do this. The family should be a place of values and a place of safety for all. The sick spectacle of pre-teen precociousness should be seen as creepy and unacceptable, stealing childhood.\nStep-fatherhood should be an exception rather than a rule. Boys should mirror the father’s respect for the mother and should see girls as their equals, not as objects.\nAll faiths require modesty and modesty should be an expectation, particularly for children. The answer to sexual abuse is like many other things a matter of putting values back into society. Reverse the wholesale destruction of the primary family unit. The fact that too many stakeholders can’t bring themselves to say this, explains why when the system looks at the issue, the solutions are muddled and perverse. Preserve the status quo and achieve nothing more than more harm, abuse and unhappiness. Changing things for the betterment of children might just make life less exciting, more responsible and routine for adults but then you can’t go on blaming cultural sensitivity and the failure of expensive state agencies when children continue to copy adults, sexual behaviour and too many are abused.\nThe fact that in too many parts of the west adults put themselves first and pervert the environment for their children is the reason why faith communities see the west as weak and self-destructive. Raising stable families freed from the fear of emotional uncertainty who can be socially, if not economically productive, requires time and effort. In the absence of this time and effort from parents, the government has to pay for it…..and paying they are, or perhaps more accurately we all are!\n22.03.15 Tunisian museum tragedy- The criminals Vs the West V1\nThe horror of the shootings at the museum in Tunisia only serves to highlight the impasse between the criminals who identify themselves as Muslim and the rest of the peoples of the world. The fear we have is that this is a war neither side can win; it’s a Mutually Assured Destruction but fought with bombs, bullets and brutality as opposed to the technologically out of reach Weapons of Mass Destruction. Although that could, of course, come later.\nThe statement by ISIS was chilling in its content as for the first time we heard a statement to the effect that all westerners are legitimate targets simply for being westerners; There is no attempt to distinguish one from any other; this is the criminals setting themselves against the world in all its beautiful and wonderful diversity. The west and the world must now be starting to recognise that here we have a culture of brutality and ignorance that will not respond to any kind of appeal to better nature, common sense or humanity. So how do we deal with it? As to deal with it, we must.\nThe first thing the west needs to do as we have said many times before is look at itself and the way its culture might adversely affect the planet and challenge the world’s morality. Western culture has many obvious flaws some of which we have referred to in previous posts so won’t re-rehearse them again here. What we have not explored to date is why the west has considerable social problems that often become economic in character. These problems create victims, financial winners and losers and spawn often deplorable lifestyles around which a fetishized obsession develops among many people of faith, and which becomes incendiary within the minds of criminals who adopt Islam as a cloak of legitimacy for their violence and brutality.\nIn the minds of many people of faith, the western world is adopting an illegitimate way of life, based on a concept of wealth which has for decades owed little to our ever-decreasing productive capacity. This is for us the essential weakness of western culture and the hair trigger for violence against us. We magic up from nowhere the wealth of such enormous size and complexity that it flows around the planet; not doing good but creating the context for lifestyles that are as unsustainable as the “Dust Bowl” Islamism favoured by ISIS.\nThe capacity to produce true value in the west is considerably smaller than the amount of wealth created on the back of that value. The wealth which has little real value flows around and unfortunately ends up all too often in the hands of either the corrupt or the criminal. For every Bill Gates, there are far too many racketeers and hucksters in every country in the world, inspiring fear, and frustration at one level and hatred and violence at the other.\nThe solution to this massive global problem is the west recognising that a lot of what is called wealth is nothing of the sort. It has no real value and the people who have it may not be particularly deserving of it but have just got lucky. This applies to businesspeople and perhaps more appropriately our celebrities and those who feed off the dreams of others, pop stars and the like.\nThe glitz and glamour funded by worthless debt-based wealth which is pumped into the system by frightened Governments who fear war and revolution if the money-go-round slows down. For the rest of us, the money-go-round is simply a form of enslavement trapping us into faithless and pointless lifestyles which offer little hope of happiness or salvation and which because it is debt based widens the difference between value and wealth even further.\nWealth without any value is simply an immoral hoarding of someone else’s debt. So for us the driver for our unsustainable western lifestyle is our ability to create money with no value and to thereby fund lifestyles of no value…….with all the attributes you would expect; abandoned elderly, divorce, adultery, illegitimacy and so on and so forth. These horrors will happen and in a tolerant western society for some time to come, we guess it is to be expected. That is why the Western governments are compelled to deploy wealth harvested from real production to tackle the problem but augment this with consumption based on indebtedness.\nAs lifestyles go we have come to practice the above all too casually, and on an almost industrial scale. So when Criminals identify themselves as Muslims and looks at the west they can see a lifestyle which is bogus, inhuman and essentially unsustainable paid for by money created in an Alice in Wonderland economy.\nSuch a view triggers the violent instinct that believes a dose of dust bowl Islamism will cure the west of its ills. The purity of a simple desert life with apostates being beheaded and adulterers stoned seems to be a way of solving the very crux of the west’s obvious problem, but that problem isn’t simply moral it’s economic too; that is too much money chasing too little morality.\nWe believe many people of faith will agree with the above, hence we suspect the number of converts to Christianity, Islam and other faiths may well increase. In addition, there may be a return to primitivism within some faiths. However what people of true faith will not be interested in doing is destroying the culture and character of their faith or the faith of others and replace it with, for example, a 7th-century dust bowl variety of faith, based on brutality and fear.\nPeople with deep and enlightened faith will adopt a faith-based lifestyle for themselves which puts some much-needed morality back into lives blighted by too little social or productive activity. Our weight gain and poor health our idleness and self-obsession are easily identifiable symptoms of the problem\nThe ISIS criminals want to destroy western wealth which they fetishize as the cause of our problems. As we have said our wealth creation needs to be brought down to a level where it has a closer approximation to an actual value created (less froth more real value) and is less prone to drift into the wrong hands, but the west should not and does not deserve to be destroyed. The ISIS dust bowl has absolutely no productive capacity and as we have said previously it is the role of individuals, families, tribes, nations and empires to create value to sustain themselves. ISIS destroys not only wealth but value and by destroying value they will ultimately destroy themselves.\nWe think in our next blog post I’ll look at the humanity and freedom the west offers the world and explore this strange notion of value.\n30.03.15 Tunisian museum tragedy- The criminals Vs the West V2\nValue plays a key role in all societies and was particularly significant in the past. There was in the very early days of mankind’s existence social value generated by individuals observing their belief system, enabling them to produce economic value with minimal fear, harmoniously in most cases, to provide the food to support their families and community.\nWar was then, as now the destruction of value usually by one group against another but sometimes within the same group. Faith was closely linked to stability; therefore any behaviour outside of the “norm” which affected the ability to provide food to support the whole community required serious retribution. It made no sense to waste value on transgressors. Some faiths still support the practice of harsh punishment because the link to their past is still quite strong and the link to the perception of survival is raw.\nAs society moved forward technologically this social value became a bit less important as more complex social arrangements emerged; detached from the survival issue by technology albeit only plough and Oxen the link was weakened further between what people did and whether they contributed directly to the general survival of all or could lived on the value produced by others. By this time economic value could be stored in the form of money or other valuables rather than immediately consumed. It was at this point that politics emerged as a force, competing with faith not only to control people’s minds but control the value they created. This was the shift from pre-agricultural society to post agriculture; organisation, primitive technology, and investment began to emerge.\nThe value created was economic value on a greater scale. Once value could be created and stored rather than immediately consumed, “faith” became a means by which the ruling classes (Kings, Pharaohs etc) exercised control to ensure that people surrendered their share of the economic value they produced to the ruling class. Society was pretty much like this for millennia; with the west and their reformation most recently starting the process of gradually weakening the control of the kings, and via capitalism, and then in some places socialism, reallocating value to the “organisers of the means of production” or government respectively.\nThe ancient Egyptians had a society that took the value from the Nile and created a Kingdom which lasted five thousand years. The value was not sent back to the people who created it and many Biblical stories reflect this period of slavery; value creation, requisition, submission, and control. The stories capture the role of faith in tackling the issue of value requisition and how the societies involved, tackled the problem. For the Egyptian society to last five thousand years the faith of the people in the legitimacy of that society and their place in it must have been very strong.\nValue is therefore whatever is created by an individual or society that allows them to survive. It can be stored and accumulated, gave rise to complex societies and its existence in a stored form is why politics was born. Value is the birth mother of politics, and faith its handmaiden.\nNow there was a limit to how much you can accumulate and store value in hard coinage and bullion terms. We suspect the reason the Pharaoh’s survived as long as they did was because the value that the Nile created was sufficient to allow them to hoard a lot of value, and employ and feed workers and slaves and this coupled to people’s faith in the gods made the whole enterprise legitimate for all concerned. The Pharaoh’s were essentially the guarantors of stability and sustenance for all. They removed the fear and contingency that in mankind’s very early days, faith alone had done; by spending some of the surplice value on “projects” that employed and fed people.\nThe birth of politics had weakened faith as men and more recently women began to realise that the status quo could be challenged. The allocation of economic value away from those who actually created it was viewed as wrong. Faith, unfortunately, became popularised as “the opium of the people” by thinkers like Karl Marx; thus it became seen as a reactionary force, holding society back. Enterprise which is essentially the creation of economic value is of course a good thing, so there needs to be some premium paid to the person who organises the production process. But really should the economic and social system be so perverse a system that it creates today’s super rich. Those of faith could now do more to challenging the system.\nThis concept of the super rich in today’s society (people on par with the Kings of the past) brings me onto the next theme of this post. That is how, over thousands of years, from value being pretty much what humans picked off trees, pulled out of the ground or killed, it became sufficiently plentiful and storable for people with big sticks to hoard it, deny it to others and make themselves rich. What has happened since this time of the initial hoarding of value is that the kings have gone (although the oligarchs in Russia and the thugs of ISIS are an obvious throw backs to the men with big sticks. In the case of ISIS however there is no value to be created from new and future production. They are essentially parasites with no economic capacity, simply a perverted idea of social value they impose with brute force, dust bowl Islam as I call it).\nThe western world has created the conditions for the super rich to emerge. Since the early days of economics in Biblical times the world has created lots of cleaver ways of making a little value look like a lot of wealth, rather than creating more actual value. Creating real economic value is hard work;it involves combing land, labour and capital in proportions which make a profit. Making a little value look more impressive is relatively easy, once you have the financial smoke and mirrors set up.\nIn the west there is little promotion of social value (old fashioned faith type value for example or doing something for nothing) and a reliance on debt rather than the creation of economic value. This debt is brought into existence with some cleaver tricks of accounting, allowing money to be printed to stimulate “consumption”. By leaving our faith base we have become too entitled and moved our governments into a world of “Alice in Wonderland” economics to drive the economy. In such an economy a pea sized amount of value can be turned into a planet sized amount of wealth via debt. Of course the major problem is the poor pay for this and the and the rich acquire it; including Russell Brand…whoever he is. Wealth creation is where the fun starts as it involves Banks and Governments and bogey men of all descriptions.\nSo what we have now after a millennia and more of growth and development in our “Financial Services” is a total disconnection between value (which is something be it social or economic that has to be on a human scale and created by complex human activity as opposed to pressing button on a computer) and wealth which is no longer linked to value and which can be multiplied out of all recognition based on airy fairy concepts such as confidence or belief in the market. This is the real problem for those of faith who believe in things being both real and on a human scale and having social as well as economic dimensions. The problem for those of faith and the more enlightened of those with no faith is that we are simply peddling a broken economic model which taxes the poorer to create wealth for the richer and in doing so undermines our moral purpose; there is little in the way of real value supporting or underpinning the whole teetering edifice.\nOur economic model malfunctions due to a number of modern phenomenon driven by our drift from faith and belief in the need for survival. Welfarism; paying people to be idle and simply exist for themselves or to farm babies on an often industrial scale to tap off wealth for themselves wealth created by taxpayers and government debt. It also works through the public sector; paying people to do jobs that should not be necessary if society functioned to create social and economic value. Well paid jobs bankrolled on the back of a debt economy that costs the poorest the most through taxes they have no choice but to pay.\nSome public sector salaries in Great Britain are twice or three times what the British Prime Minister earns. How odd is that. Not odd at all if you consider that the upper reaches of the Public sector including Westminster politics has become the occupation of choice for many in the British upper classes. Well that or Acting! Finally with all this valueless wealth sloshing around, largely created for and on behalf of the Government “the rich” are able to tap it off by creating businesses which appeal to people’s baser drives for example sexual services and “want” based consumption. The whole thing is offensive to those of faith and some of no faith because it reflects a race to the moral bottom, creating debt for the Government and the poor, whilst rewarding the “rich” for whom their principle moral reaction to their good fortune is to pay as little tax on profits or earnings as possible\nThe upshot of this system is that the economy does what it is doing now…..it starts to fail. We have referred to how this failure manifests itself socially; divorce and illegitimacy on an industrial scale, domestic violence, obsessions around spending and consumption, a society of entitlement rather than social or economic duty. How far we have come technologically yet morally we are little better than our squabbling ancestors trying to make sense of a strange frightening and confusing world whilst allowing the overlords to take most of the wealth. The difference is; we started to sort it out once and now we are throwing the legacy away.\nIn a future blog post we hope to explore two key elements of the modern western world by looking at how the “relationship” industry and housing industry work in a morally unacceptable way. Both are a product of the poverty in social and economic value, and both reflect the flight from faith and Darwinian survival; both sowing the seeds of the unfortunate and unnecessary but relentless destruction of the west and its diverse culture based on choice, contract, and consent.\n06.04.15 Tunisian museum tragedy- The criminals Vs the West V3\nWe seem to be unintentionally creating the conditions in the world where Christians are being killed simply for being Christians. Whilst blame should and will always remain with the criminals we must look at contexts to understand the situation with a little more sophistication. Christians are being butchered in some of the most barbaric ways imaginable as well as simply being mown down by gunfire. The perpetrators of this behaviour are a murderous class of criminals who identify themselves with Islam, but who fail to understand the difference between Christianity and the more widely known secular western culture.\nI can well imagine the fanatics in the caves and compounds viewing western culture and hating every second of it whilst at the same time being strangely aroused by the freedoms, particularly sexual freedoms on offer in the west which true Christians feel are as absurd as many of other faiths and none. I have written about this in an earlier post. When barbarity stops being a reaction to possible extinction it becomes fetishised. The Saudi Arabian culture captures this most profoundly. People (many I am sure poor, mentally ill etc) experience their last, sad, pathetic moments of life as a spectator sport, at the Friday beheadings. Now this template of Islamic culture has a wide appeal and along with intolerance, sexual prejudice, and obsession for cultural purity is alluring for those who despise the west. In this scenario things like the west’s sexual freedom come to justify cruelty towards Christians on an unimaginable scale.\nThe sexual freedom the west has experienced for most of the last fifty years has unfortunately let to widespread and indifferent promiscuity with all the personal tragedy that this throws up. However whilst the response should be that you don’t kill people because you object to what is seen as their culture it becomes more compelling when the justification is a mix of cultural hatred and sexual excitement.\nThere are those in the west with a fetishized fascination with death; on the internet death is viewed as entertainment by the immature curious and perverted. Within fanatical groups the voyeur becomes the practitioner, where motivated by a desire for retribution arising from their own repressed sexual excitement the blood lust becomes fanatical indeed. ISIS and al Shabab are reacting with violence and cruelty because they hate arousal, particularly sexual arousal that western culture causes them. Dealing with the whole western moral swamp is the western world’s biggest challenge.\nThis brings me to the point about ISIS and al Shabab criminality and the abuse of Christianity. In my opinion Christians are being slaughtered because of the moral “sins” of the western world; yet no Christian would sanction the kind of behaviour which the Criminals of ISIS et al find so arousing. There is no place in Christianity for immodesty, pornography and greed. So when ISIS or al Shabab kill Christians they are killing people who have a certain view of how life should be lived which would be in harmony with their own if they were not simply criminals hell bent on blood lust and slaughter.\nFor all faith’s and those of no faiths to live in harmony the west to turn back to a more moral way of living not just Christian living, but any moral code which promotes moral behaviour. In world like this Criminal gangs of ISIS and Al Shabab would have no support within the ranks of their own professed faith, they would have to stop killing and grow up.\n06.04.15 Britain- a Christian country? Some mistake surely\nBritain’s Prime Minister David Cameron was not alone in suggesting this Easter that Great Britain is a Christian country. Whilst quite rightly endorsing, as we do, that we accept all faiths and those of no faith the idea Britain is Christian rather than secular liberal is one of the reasons why Christianity is despised by many who hold a strong faith be it Islamic or Buddhist or whatever faith or set of guiding moral principles including Darwinism. However not surprisingly traditional Christians too reject the outcomes arising from the destruction of faith-based morality and the promotion of the secular liberal moral sursum corda stripped of all moral content.\nIt would be more correct to point out that Britain was a Christian country but is no longer (just look at the declining attendance numbers at Church) however it has a Christian tradition which when coupled to economic freedom drove the British economy to a level of global power which has never been surpassed. If you take out the specifically “Christian” elements of Christ and the Gospels; what Christianity helped to create in Britain whilst constraining within moral boundaries, were the three elements upon which western culture and latterly the west’s freedoms evolved; namely consent, contract and choice. These are elements within the world’s DNA of which Britain can rightly be proud. Yet without the moderating influence of Christian morality these elements throw up horrors and perversity of a truly deplorable kind; family breakdown, pornography, abuse and exploitation, illegitimacy, idleness and greed. Without a moral framework contract, choice and consent create the seeds of the west’s slow destructive devolution and perversely make other “rule” as opposed to “conscience” based faiths seem more legitimate.\nJust a thought at Easter.\n08.04.15 What happens when rules replace morality?\nIf you look at what is happening in Britain and the rest of the western world something quite odd is going on. In earlier times we had to rely in strict rules and justification for our day to day behaviour. The reason as earlier posts have explained is the need to protect value…an essential component in any society which expects to survive. As we have matured, we became less reliant on “rules” imposed from outside of ourselves and accepted that some rules were just good in observance and seemed to come from within. This conferred legitimacy. This is morality coming from within us and not imposed from without us. The problem was that certain things like sexuality became subject to this moral code and were considered unacceptable; homosexuality for example. However, what has replaced morality is a set of rules that the state is required to enforce. This is expensive and lacks “buy in”. Are we really a society that respects all faiths and no faith groups or indeed people who choose a different lifestyle? Do we really support all who are none-the -less are value promoting and legitimate?\nWhat has happened is that we have created a rule-based society-like we had in our distant past. The difference now is that these rule based modern societies or rather their governments are not protecting social and economic value by consuming a small proportion of that value to preserve the rest; they are creating debt based wealth to uphold their rules even though those rules are decent and well intentioned it costs a lot to uphold them. It was once said that history repeats itself; the first time as tragedy the second time as farce. That sort of explains where we are now re-establishing a rule-based society funded by borrowed money to preserve a society that creates no value. The rules may or may not be right but the cost of upholding them is unaffordable. They need to be come moral faith based rather than rule based to survive and preserve the west’s culture of contract choice and consent.\nUnless people and particularly politicians understand these contradictions in how we rely on rules the values of the hard right or rule-based faiths start to look legitimate; hence Russia as the upholder of Christendom and ISIS et al the upholders of Islam. Wow – what a combination.\n19.08.15 A message to the Jihadi “brides”\nThere has been much speculation about why you would have chosen to go to Syria and become the brides of the criminals fighting out there. It has been said that it was because the police didn’t stop you or somehow your education failed you. , I don’t want to go into any of that, no do I want to suggest you were “groomed” on the internet. No, I want to suggest to you that you went because you wanted to go; you saw, as I see, as a person of faith, that some activities are morally worthwhile. The view you have adopted will see the decadence of what you rather naively see as Christendom as an affront to Islam. If you agree with me so far you must accept that Western culture is, as I have said before, in its more deranged manifestations, an insult to Christianity and all other faiths too, not just Islam.\nHowever, whilst the west parted company from Christianity decades ago the desire to slay the beast of Christendom continues. You I believe were drawn to what you will probably argue is this moral cause. However, a word of caution…you may be devout and Muslim but you are also western. Let me explain.\nAs a western woman you will have become used to being listened to and to use an irritating “right on phrase” having a voice. You expect this because you are educated and happy and alive. The opportunity to be like this comes from the western world’s belief that you have rights….not conferred by your husband or your religion but by your western culture. You have the right to choose; for example what to wear, who to marry, whether you want to have a sexual relationship………or whether you don’t, whether you want a job or children. In your new world this choice will be taken away. Your husband will decide all this for you and your “voice” will be drowned out in a hail of anger and violence. Your western culture affords you the right to consent, you may choose to marry but not consent to being beaten or being forced to wear a veil or have children or worse. In your new world the concept of consent does not really have any place. No one is consenting to anything. It is brute force and ignorance on an industrial scale. Finally, you can contract so that what you agree, you can expect, be it the mundane purchase of a washing machine or a service of any other sort for example health care. In your new world social contracts are a piece of decadent western nonsense so when something harmful happens, you will not be treated with kindness and get sensible recompense; you will be lucky if you are spared any time or humanity at all.\nFinally, the criminals of ISIS will not like your views, views that you should expect to contract have choice and consent to things that affect you. These western values will in all probability be beaten out of you, so you become a Jihadi bride, uncontaminated and cleansed of western decadence and western rights.\nBut whilst I can see your strong faith as the motivation for joining Isis….. as I have suggested above frankly you are not what they want, you are too cleaver, sensible, sane and have the normal expectations of any western woman, that you live your life your way. The fact that in the west we abuse and debase our rights making short term stupid moral choices does not mean our rights are wrong, just that some of us are wrong, as you will no doubt be discovering from some ISIS controlled sand pit somewhere in Syria. Oh and the same applies to the boys as well.\n26 April 15 The new seven deadly sins\nOver the next seven weeks I am going to explore the concept of sin from the perspective of what I want to call the “new seven deadly sins”. The old “sins” remain problematic; gluttony, Ire, Greed etc but whereas in the past such behaviours would undoubtedly have caused harm to others in the longer term the harm is significantly less pronounced today and in many ways these old sins affect the perpetrator much more than the recipient. The new sins are in my view both more problematic and in the long term more harmful to the perpetrator, recipient and society at large, although as with everything faith related the real harm from modern moral decline does not in all cases impact immediately but slowly by stealth over time. I hope also that these new “sins” can form the basis for inter faith discussion as many of them both challenge and conform to faith based ideas of what is sinful, whilst placing these sins within the context of the twenty first century.\nTo start with I will simply list them in the order in which I consider their seriousness; staring with what I consider to be the most sinful of all behaviours. I will explore these sins in more details over the following weeks.\n03.05.15 Deadly sin number 1: Cruelty\nThere is obvious cruelty such as that committed by ISIS et al however this as I have suggested previously more akin to serious and violent crime than a mere sinful act perpetrated on another individual or ones-self. So, what do I consider to be cruelty which falls short of a crime? That which does not include harming animals or being violent towards one another.\nOne of the problems people of genuine faith feel about the modern world is that there is too much emphasis on each of us getting our own way; having what we want; being stimulated for example by drink drugs or sex. Cruelty is what is carried out when someone realises, they may have made a mistake but not before they have allowed themselves to get into a situation that they subsequently discover they don’t like. The sort of cruelty I am referring to therefore is most often but not exclusively seen within families or other close nit groups. Cruelty has to have an element of viciousness or vindictiveness about it and the aim of the perpetrator is to cause hurt as a response to an error of judgement they may have made in getting into a situation they no longer value respect or like. Racism is cruelty; antisemitism is cruelty at the level of picking on some individual with hurtful words which fall short of being a crime; beyond that is clearly a crime. However thankfully aside from a small group of criminals; some self-identified as people of faith, this type of cruelty is comparatively rare.\nThe cruelty which I believe to be more common is the cruelty played out in homes all over the place. We rush into ill-considered relationships driven by our out of control sex drives urged on by a combination of the reproductive instinct and the stimulation of the drug and dream like effects of sexual activity itself. We don’t stop ourselves from this headlong rush to get “intimate” and indeed there are people who see little harm in widespread promiscuity. However the prevalence of promiscuity reflects two fundamental issues closely linked to cruelty; the extent to which people throw away something which should be special; their naked physical presence in the company of a partner whom they wish to love and cherish, and from whom they expect the same, and the lack of any really considered application of thought about whether the relationship has any long term value. By the time these decisions have been made there may be children and responsibility the boredom of a relationship with a partner with whom one has “intimacy” but whom one neither respects of loves. This is the environment within which cruelty breeds. It is manifest in a number of acts some easily understood such as adultery, all the way down to causing someone to worry (staying out later than agreed and not returning concerned calls), words of indifference “oh do what you want”, words of irritation “oh go away” to words designed to cause harm “you are stupid/ugly/useless”. These casual acts of cruelty harm the recipients emotionally and ultimately are a sign that someone has made a poor life choice but is unprepared to take responsibility for it. Cruelty causes depression and suicide drug and alcohol misuse. I think the proliferation of pornography is to meet the needs of men and women trapped into unsatisfactory relationships yet preoccupied with sex; and its use can be an act of cruelty itself. At the most extreme the toxic context of cruelty can provide the self-justification for domestic violence and child abuse particularly in “reconstituted households”. This is the reason that in the western world I consider cruelty to be the deadliest of the seven deadly sins. To avoid sinning we need to return to a way of life that requires us to consider our relationships carefully and avoid getting into situations where cruelty is the means of feeling better about ourselves in our self-inflicted dire situation. The West championed the three concepts of Consent, Choice and Contract as a means of protecting the individual, we need to observe them but use them wisely otherwise we will leave ourselves open to the claim that unfettered by “rules” we simply behave like animals.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_introduction-christianity-and-islam-a-marxist-analysis/content_370.html": "Introduction – Christianity and Islam – a Marxist Analysis\nIntroduction – Christianity and Islam – a Marxist Analysis\nThe Blue Revolution is a political platform which aims to bring an end to the party political system by enabling as many like-minded people as possible from as wide a variety of backgrounds to stand for elections at every administrative level from Parish to Parliament. This is achieved by the simple means of authorising the use of the platforms emblems to those who endorse the Blue Revolution “core values” and five manifesto pledges.\nAs part of this process, a series of publications have been produced on important issue s which underpin our political attitudes and can be found on our Website www.ABlueRevolution.Org as well as in booklet form available from the address above.\nThis latest discussion paper has been produced because of the turmoil surrounding particularly in the Western world the effect of the two main religions and secularization .has on political thinking.\nWith increasing global interrelationships the issues of religious discord have become more strident and confused in the lives of people. Add to this mix political uncertainty and political response becomes more extreme and less than helpful to voters. Party politics seem irrelevant and voters become disillusioned.\nThis paper is part of an overall contribution attempting to come at the situation from a new perspective whilst drawing on past concepts.\nChristianity and Islam – a Marxist Analysis\nMarxism rejects the spiritual and adopts a materialist interpretation of history. Materialism is the study of economic and social reality not just the world of ideas. According to Classical Marxists the history of religion is simply the history of ideas that work in the economic interests of the powerful, but with the powerful claiming these ideas are sanctified by God. This sleight of hand, using God to justify material inequality, was a common feature of ideologies in the age of antiquity and is described by Plato as a ‘golden lie’ in his work known as ‘The Republic’.\nTherefore, social progress according to Marxists does not happen because a God intervenes in human affairs. Marxists believe in progress arising from various active economic and scientific forces creating real-world conflicts which by getting resolved in the real-world, change society. This active process is called dialectics. Marxism is therefore based on dialectical materialism, the history of humanities social progress in terms of the conflict and resolution of various economic and scientific realities.\nFurthermore, Marx argued that religion reflects various stages in the evolution of human consciousness as it is shaped by economic and scientific reality. Basically, the easier people find it to accept inequality and discrimination as ‘God’ given, the less evolved a person’s consciousness could be claimed to be. A troubling thought for everyone from the Salafists of Saudi Arabia to the Bourgeoisie of North America and Europe.\nIn the world of Classical Marxism, we have only two big world perspectives, the abstract ideas of religions and their Gods and the idea of Materialism. For Classical Marxists, it is all about economic, scientific and social facts, not faith.\nTo many ordinary western working people, Christianity and Islam have lost their relevance as neither reflects the material or spiritual needs of twenty-first-century humanity, both being stuck in a world of past inequality sanctified by ‘God’\nAs a result of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century revolutionary movements that created capitalism and which arose because protestant Christian doctrine was shaped by demands for greater social and economic mobility, the west created a society that eventually developed personal freedom and principles of legally enforced consent-based choice and contract, for all adults. Essentially freedom, but for most ordinary working people it amounted to little more than the freedom to starve! For capitalism to get established people had eventually to have this radical change forced on them. They did so because Protestantism needed to measure righteousness and virtue on earth and could not if religion were in favour of the poor in heaven as feudalism had been.\nRoll forward three hundred years and the issue for the west is that this legal and economic consent-based framework now gives rise to an unbridled free for all, the ‘free market’ This leaves many impoverished whilst others, amass fortunes and the whole system has more than just a whiff of the immoral about it.\nWithout some widely understood and accepted rules of fair play this economic model has begun to consume society with what is seen by many as planet destroying greedy self-interest. A mass grab for consumables with little self-regulation. This has come about because the slow decline of Christianity, most marked in Western Europe, has eroded the application of Protestant Christian social values of hard work, sobriety, and thrift. At its simplest, Christianity based on ‘love thy neighbour’ eventually put some limits on the harsh economic indifference of the capitalist economy with workhouses, charities and prison reform. This was before Governments, yielding to outraged public opinion, became the nation’s moral arbiters, upholding choice-based consent, in a secular and therefore ‘rights’ based moral framework. Islamic sharia being a ‘political ideology’ offers humanity an alternative moral solution to both secularism’s rights and Christian morality.\nChristianity having helped to create a dynamic social and economic society has now lost its role in shaping or constraining it, leaving it to a combination of personal self-interest constrained only by costly state intervention. This free-for-all offends people of faiths as well as those who believe in secular self-restraint imposed by the state. In the world of religion, Islam offers an alternative to all that the now secular once Christian west has created. Indeed, a non-violent form of ‘political Islam’ which extols the virtues of sharia and obedience to Allah within a peaceful Islam offers what seems to be considered by some Muslim scholars a path between Capitalism and Marxism. The writer George Bernard Shaw is often wrongly quoted as supporting this view. However because sharia is an ideology which pre dates capitalism and is based on submission to the revealed word of God and the human example set by Muhammed an example of man to be impersonated by others it lacks the consent based choice that is fundamental to any proper ‘Marxist’ revolution.\nSo, within the world of Christian and Islamic faith we have two views, self-restraint within Christianity, now largely ignored and a more rigid application of rules within Islam based on the Qur’an and Hadith. How can we understand this conflict in Marxist terms and therefore help to address it using a shared understanding of God to heal the difference between these two religions and assist both to an understanding of the secular community who feel threatened or baffled by religion?\nTo sort out the second part of this analysis therefore we need to ask some questions of religion. For example, how did Christianity create a dynamic social and economic model in the mid to late period of the last millennium, and why was Islam able to do the same prior to that, and then stop in or around the sixteenth century. And could Islam re discover its dynamic potential today?\nChristianity’s first revolution was presenting in the first century a triune God. A God of three persons, father, son and holy spirit. Within Classical Marxism, it is possible to understand the significance of the Trinity in a way that explains its importance economically. Marx used the principles of dialectics to explain social evolution. The terms Marx used were thesis, antithesis and synthesis. So applying these terms to Christianity’s triune God, the Father is the originator of material and social reality, the creator, the Son becomes the opposite of this harsh world of brutality, exploitation, conquest and occupation, namely the ‘love’ of God, made man, Jesus, and the spirit is the process that combines them as they become collective Christian consciousness. This mirrors Marxist working-class consciousness. An awareness of the adverse consequences of earthly status, unfairness and inequality. Rich men and needles so to speak.\nIn Marxist theory thesis, antithesis and synthesis were used in the nineteenth century for an analysis of the politics of revolution. From the time of Christ onwards, the process of human material realities being established and then challenged, thus creating new economic and social systems eventually created the capitalist system. Capitalism based on extending basic legal principles of consent and choice within a free economy and to an expanding middle class, was, perhaps because of its somewhat anarchic nature, described by Adam Smith in the eighteenth century as being governed by an invisible hand. An abstracted concept used to describe the movement of resources in pursuit of economic goals, giving rise to both economic and social outcomes. Over-time by extending consent and choice to working men, women and minorities, Christian morality was undermined by secular rights.\nIslam in the seventh century never accepted the trinity, adopting an implacable form of monotheism which is described as the doctrine of Tawhid which in its own way is as revolutionary as the Trinity was six hundred years earlier.\nTawhid holds that God is a singularity without characteristic, definition or form. God is abstracted to the point of being almost unknowable, except as revealed via the activity of humanity summed up in the Arabic term inshallah or God willing. This too is a revolutionary idea. Because of this unknowability and the revelation of God through human behaviour both good and bad, Islam has the potential to once again become a force for economic and social progress as it was in the fourteenth century. With Tawhid it is possible to see God as more akin to Adam Smith’s and the western world’s invisible hand, than a God who differentiates people and sanctions war, revenge, conquest, conversion and submission. These are human characteristics, which humanity has ascribed to God claiming they have Gods sanctification. It enables human actions to be classed as legitimate or profane all especially useful for imperfect humanity and for those who wish to use God to promote sectarian interests.\nHowever, unlike the doctrine of Tawhid, God in much of the Islamic world is not abstracted. The God of Islam is, thanks to human intervention not without definition, character or form. This is the result of Gods singularity being revealed not through the transcendence of freely expressed collective human activity, directed by an “invisible hand” but through a revelation, delivered to Muhammed via the Angel Gabriel. The legacy of linking God to the moral requirements of one place at one time serves only to define God and therefore give Islamic justice as seventh-century man-made appearance. A morality of dress and hygiene practices and different roles and rights for women and men based on the limited understanding of seventh-century biology. It may also explain why for much of Islam’s history since the eighteen century the faithful were called Mohammedans. Followers of Mohammed and less obviously worshippers of a singular transcendent God.\nSo, in the twenty-first century, we have two powerful religions which are doctrinally at odds with each other and which both buffer against the west’s drive for a ‘secular’ world. A world without God. Christianity has given us the economic anarchy of the seventeenth to twenty-first century west and created the ‘invisible hand of capitalist free enterprise’ but has now left a moral vacuum, occupied by the secular state. Islam reflecting the unique and attractive idea of the singularity of God, a God revealing transcendence in a way like the western world’s invisible hand, has linked God to the moral and economic rites and realities of the seventh century Arab Peninsular.\nThe world has, therefore, two significant religions, neither able to progress humanity harmoniously, beset by opposing ideas of human freedom and set as they are in a secular western world of unlimited choice. Christianity had provided productive economic anarchy but today has declining moral influence. Islam has the capacity to once again be as revolutionary as Christianity once was because of Tawhid. However, by its doctrinal tie to the man-made seventh century, can do little more than encourage a return to past and now outdated certainties and religious dogma based on pre-enlightenment ideas of compulsion and coercion.\nSo, what is to be done? Maybe just accepting that for all faiths and no faith, human reality and science are Gods true revelation and they are compatible with both the doctrine of Tawhid and the western protestant and enlightenment notion of the invisible hand. The revelation of the God who is unknowable, with no definition or form revealed through the collective activity of humanity. So in conclusion within this understanding of God, both failure and success are of neutral importance as are good and evil all are God-ordained and reflect Gods love of human endeavour as we progress towards a greater understanding of Gods transcendence through the application of science and our material reality. If all faiths could accept this, it might help Christianity, Islam and secularism come to a common understanding of what God is, and moreover what God is not.\nMike Gilbert author Jane Robson proof-reader April 28th 2020",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_complaint-letter-to-bbc-about-bias-against-small-parties/content_213.html": "Complaint letter to BBC about bias against small parties.\nBlue Revolution\n22 Tower Street Boston Lincolnshire PE218RX\n02 June 2017\nComplaints Department\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\nDarlington\nDear Sir or Madam\nGeneral Election 2017\nAs a candidate standing in the Boston and Skegness constituency I was disappointed at the treatment I received by your BBC Radio Lincolnshire and Radio 5 Live teams. As a result, I wish to formally complain and challenge what seems to be BBC policy adversely affecting the contribution small parties make to Britain’s increasingly rich political tapestry.\nFirstly, I was not accorded a place on the panel of the BBC Radio Lincolnshire husting programme. When I enquired I was told that this was because the party Blue Revolution did not have a national profile. I made the point that it was a local BBC radio station and that as the only ‘other’ candidate and a local person with political experience people might wish to hear my views. Of the six candidates at the election, I was the only one excluded. I was informed it was the executive decision of the Producer from which he was not prepared to depart. I am aware other ‘Independent’ candidates were also excluded from debates in other constituencies in Lincolnshire. I was however interviewed for a recorded piece which I am told will be broadcast during the debate. The programme was postponed to Tuesday 6th May due to the terrible events in Manchester. I was not informed it was going ahead I had been told it had been cancelled, not postponed.\nMy second complaint relates to the Radio 5Live Marginal Mystery Tour which was broadcast from Skegness on 31st May. I found out about this by chance and was disappointed that once again I had not been invited as a local politician with expertise on issues linked to migration and community engagement. It was interesting to note that the UKIP candidate sent a stand in and did not attend in person.\nAs I was canvassing in Skegness that day I attended the venue and spoke to a helpful young production assistant called Jim who made a few calls and eventually I spoke with a more senior member of BBC staff by phone. I was informed that BBC policy excluded me as it is again based on a national party profile. Having decided to resume canvassing I was then called again by Jim who said that they would broadcast a few of minutes of me at around about 12.35. I was in the end given about a minute or so prior to which I had to endure some comic turn by a BBC presenter who implied (please note implied) that I was some ‘numpty’ (his words) who wanted to talk about politics rather than eat ice cream on the beach. The brief interview went well, albeit Blue Revolution being identified with parties like the ‘Fancy Dress party’ I felt was a bit unnecessary. It also seemed to me that the interview was cut short for no obvious reason. The ‘comic turn’ was unnecessary if time was a factor.\nThe points I want the BBC to consider are these. Britain is in danger of having a political system which fails to reflect the diversity of the British population and in its attempt to shoehorn all opinion into ‘established party’ categories the BBC leaves the electorate feeling increasingly alienated and angry. This is precisely why we set up our party Blue Revolution. We believe that the parliamentary system institutionalises two-party politics to such an extent it effectively excludes others. In so doing it reflects the adversarial and increasingly undemocratic nature of politics.\nIn the 21st century, the parliamentary system is becoming incapable of reflecting diverse British views at a level close to the government. Big party and current parliamentary systems effectively lock out of politics different perspectives or new opinion among a wide range of voter. The BBC in the opinion of our Party colluded with this in your treatment of me. The experience of UKIP disappearing locally confirms that the two-party hegemony prevails in an age when it really should not. We are no longer a mono-cultural, monoracial and essentially a two-class based country.\nFurthermore, a constituency election is a race, not a war and therefore there is no justification for publicly funded bodies like the BBC taking sides. Blue Revolution is a serious party with a serious purpose and it is for the electorate to decide on the merits of the message who should win that ‘local’ race, not the BBC. In addition to paying my broadcast licence fee we as a party paid my £500.00 deposit to confirm I am not a frivolous candidate, that is all the BBC needed to consider\nFinally, it is hard enough for a small party to fund and pay for a full one leaflet campaign which comes in at about £1000.00. In addition, there are the costs associated with starting the party in the first place. The situation is more precarious for small parties when the £500 deposit will almost certainly be lost by not gaining the 5% of the vote necessary for its return. The BBC has a critical role here. No one expects a small party to win in what is clearly a rigged two-party system, however by denying local publicity, the BBC makes the loss of the deposit more likely and therefore the future of small parties very precarious. This is something which in our opinion is not good for democracy. The BBC should champion small parties not treat them like an embarrassment to be patronised.\nPlease, can you consider the points above and let me have a response to my complaints. Please, could you also confirm whether you intend to put the issues I have highlighted before the BBC Executive Team and what the outcome of their deliberation was? Do they feel a review of the policy is necessary?\nYours sincerely\nMike Gilbert",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_the-horror-in-manchester-so-far-few-responses-truly-hit-the-mark-about-this-tragedy/content_382.html": "The horror in Manchester. Few responses truly hit the mark that Islam and western values are totally incompatible. But why are they? V2\nA concert aimed at girls and their mums. A singer with an empowering feminist message. This is the reflection of a society that accepts independence and liberation for women as well as men. It is a society that has evolved from the reformation through Protestantism and having had its values seared into its western culture by capitalism and industrialisation now offers the world the free market. The free market is an asset to the world albeit one that is exhausting the planet due to its relentless ‘growth’. It is however at the same time as granting personal freedom the one thing that really seems to infuriate the Islamist to commit acts of unbelievable horror. But why is this?\nThe Islamist has a rigid view of the world, a neurosis almost which in pre-capitalist times would have been a common characteristic among many people of faith. It is prescriptive and determines who has power and authority. In this antiquated system, men have power and authority women less and what power they had, they would exercise through the authority of their husbands. There were set ways to do things and transgression was punished. This is 15th or 16th Century Britain but also Saudi Arabia today and this is the mindset of the modern Islamist terrorist. We have a problem.\nThe whole diversity agenda spoon fed to us by the Blair regime failed to recognise that different cultures and religions view basic differences between people in very different ways and this gives rise to discrimination. In simple Islamic societies rights are accorded on the basis of gender and status and some groups not only have no status but can be put to death for expressing themselves in ways that are prohibited. Freedom of expression, sexual liberation, choice and the right to consent to what happens to you are alien concepts in this kind of faith. They are alien because we enjoy them in the west as a result of our economic and social evolution. Contract, Choice and Consent come with capitalism. You can’t have one without the other. The free market is also based on these freedoms as it has evolved from capitalism in the late 1970’s.\nSo the narrative which we must adopt when dealing with Islamists or indeed anyone who professes a faith is this; “to what extent does your interpretation of your faith reflect the rights of the individual, of any individual (female, homosexual, person of whatever faith) to contract with others freely, to consent to behaviour or refuse to consent, and to choose their own lifestyle as long as it doesn’t affect others”. If you ask anyone of faith this question you would see immediately whether they accept the West’s heritage drawn from its capitalist history or whether they cannot reconcile our freedoms with the demands and rules of their faith. If Trump had asked the Saudis these questions we think he would have been shocked by how few if any “shared values” there are aside from selling arms and buying oil.\nWe don’t need to brag about our free market culture, there are many things that need improving but in giving the world Contract, Choice and Consent capitalism has liberated us all. Perhaps it is our freedom and its link to capitalism that makes the left so squeamish and prone to controlling policies and which finds Corbyn making common cause with those who hate the West. Corbyn needs to understand that capitalism wasn’t just an economic model that exploited workers, it also gave people freedom and a way of life that the Islamists are now trying to destroy.\nIndividual Muslims may have had their own personal reformation but the religion hasn’t and can’t. That bit of history has been and gone leaving its legacy only in the West for us to share with those who will listen.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_are-british-workers-unified-by-class-or-values/content_365.html": "Are British workers unified by class or values?\nThe values we in the western world now accept without question were born in the fierce heat of 18th Century Capitalism. They were described by Marx as bourgeois values. They were in addition to freedom from feudal oppression, the freedoms of Contract, Choice and Consent. There was of course unfairness which meant that unless you “made it” within this system you could not enjoy the full fruits and freedoms of bourgeois life. You might have had the right to contract, choose and consent but your life was defined by your wealth.\nOf course whilst Capitalism, as a system was gender, religion and racially unprejudiced (anyone could become a Capitalist) society, discriminated mercilessly. So back in the 18th Century, bourgeois rights were essentially male rights and white male rights at that.\nThe intervening period up to today has seen the extension of these bourgeois rights to an ever-expanding population of people few of whom can actually call themselves “bourgeois”. Being bourgeois identifies your relationship to Capital, it isn’t about how much money you have but who created the wealth that you possess. If it was created by “exploited” workers you are a Capitalist in possession of Capital. If you are public sector Chief Exec on £300,000 you are not a capitalist just a very wealthy person paid out of the Nations Debt.\nOn this basis, therefore with the decline of “capitalism,” the “workers” have become more so than ever before a large unified group of people, women, men, people of all ethnicities and identities for whom the values of contract, choice and consent are an expectation of daily life. Only the confused on the left seem to regard removing or limiting these rights a legitimate policy objective. They would usher in a 16th-century policy of silencing dissent and showing prejudice against certain groups. For the vast majority of people, the challenge is to protect these bourgeois rights now we have acquired them and learn to use them to personal and social advantage without inflicting economic and social decay via a breakdown in social cohesion.\nA breakdown in social cohesion is the major threat to western societies and there are many pretenders to the Wests throne offering various sorts of primitivism to compensate for the apparent breakdown of society arising from our new found freedoms. What these various groups of primitives fail to appreciate however is that whilst there will be some “adjustment” as we start to accept the full personal responsibility for the freedoms we have, we are all united in our desire not to have these freedoms compromised by politicians, religions or simply nasty unpleasant people.\nBritish working people are in economic terms no longer differentiated by class and are largely an undifferentiated group who have fought hard to get the shared values we now enjoy. Now we must scan the horizon to establish who is trying to undermine us and our values of contract, choice and consent and deal with them robustly.",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_mrs-may-parks-her-tanks-on-labours-lawn-but-is-it-a-future-proof-strategy/content_291.html": "Mrs May parks her tanks’ on Labour’s lawn. But is it a future proof strategy?\nTheresa May is clearly a good person with a conscience which sees merit in some of the compassionate social policies of the New Labour era. People have grown accustomed to having the state on their side not only establishing a framework in which they can exercise social and economic freedom but also standing up for them at times of fear and hardship. So far so good. The spiteful ‘Old’ Labour idea of squeezing the private sector wealthy as though they were some kind of hideous raptor screwing the country over, whilst allowing the well-heeled public sector elite to up their wages to compensate for higher taxes is outrageous. But politics today is a bit outrageous. So what of the May incursion into the Labour Party ideological heartlands?\nWell, Mrs May’s new labour policies reflect the poor state of modern Britain. Elderly people being overlooked by offspring who have been conditioned to think of themselves as economic consumer units rather than social creatures with human obligations towards the young and elderly. Enabling some twisting within the economy to allow the economically active to step out of role seems fair but it will come at a cost. We calculate the cost will be considered justified on the basis that it is cheaper than adult social care. However, people being out of the workplace are a cost to companies and the state, particularly when you have to consider covering their absence with temporary staff and then taking them back later. There is also the problem of the stressed public sector which can’t recruit at the best of times and the sheer grind of coal face work in the public sector making the option of opting out very attractive. Unfortunately, Mrs May’s new labour policies are just more of the state putting a sticking plaster and another expensive one at that on the gaping wound of failed economic and social policies. It very much reflects but in a different way the problem of how to manage the millions of people who now form the second and third generation unemployed ex-industrial and agricultural workers who have been patronised and outrageously labelled the underclass by remote politicians who patch them up with welfare and healthcare, rather than work.\nHowever, there may be a proper solution to these twin problems. How about turning the welfare benefits system into a public wage system and require everyone in the benefits system to work pro rata at the living wage for their welfare. The welfare system was set up when a man (we are talking about 7o years ago) could lose an industrial job and get another one relatively quickly. Now mortgages and debt trap people and the jobs are not going to come back anytime soon. So rather than politicians holding out the forlorn hope of the unemployed moving to another industrial job, why not empower and pay the unemployed to look after their own. Turning the second and third generation unemployed ex-industrial and agricultural workers into the first generation community social workers. We would say that was welfare well spent.",

The Tories and we mean the whole Parliamentary party have no-one to blame but themselves. Rather than have a charismatic male or female leader, the other charismatic males and one female agreed to have Theresa May lead them, thus avoiding a contest for leadership involving another ego driven charismatic. They knew her and rather than have say, Boris Johnson, or Andria Leadsome, they turned a blind eye to Theresa Mays obvious campaign failings and now they are paying the price, and so potentially is the country.\nIt has allowed Jeremy Corbyn to go all virtue signalling and economically illiterate on electors and they have lapped it up. However, the politics of Jeremy Corbyn are half-baked, and in his case half understood, ideas plucked from the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) combined with a desire to survive fractious and sometimes dangerous hard left Islington politics by ‘sort of’ agreeing with every nut job on the left wing, but over a “nice cup of tea”.\nJeremy Corbyn is an ideological lightweight but can ‘work’ a crowd. This is particularly so if the crowd is made up of people with a feeling of entitlement to ‘state’ money. He is a kind of old, grey Arianna Grande of politics. People love to be seen supporting him and he has done the Labour party proud, as you can sense from the amount of ejaculate issuing forth from the now grateful Blairites. However whilst Corbyn may have learnt how to survive Islington politics, when the Borough was (and may still be) home to the headquarters of an array of global militants and ‘people’s armies’, all hell bent on suppressing women, killing Jewish people, blowing people up, his style of politics hides the reality that these people have moved mainstream into the Labour Party. Just look at the threats and trolling!\nJeremy Corbyn’s style of politics hides the reality from people because the pacifist he was and is, would cause him to listen to them ‘non-judgmentally’ and in a spirit of agreement and thus he would not be able to disagree, possibly out of fear. The fact that people like this have moved into the mainstream Labour Party and yet are invisible to the Mumsnet voter who only sees Blairism with a cuddly old fuddy-duddy face promising them money for poor people, is truly frightening.\nCorbyn’s handlers present him as a harmless old geezer with a bunch of Blairites as a party. This is not what the Corbyn Labour party is about. It has a mainstream party membership generally confused about their identity but with a Marxist-Leninist establishment steering the Corbyn bandwagon to victory. It is so desperate for members it doesn’t know who is a member or what they believe.\nLabour Party core values have been disposed of in the Bureaucratic proto Marxist-Leninist hell-hole that is Corbyn’s Labour. “Of course, we will talk to men who beat women and exclude them from local councils, and support gender segregation”. “Yes, of course, we will talk to violent thugs who hate the West and its values, we don’t like capitalism either”! Yes, of course, we will talk to those who would persecute or even kill Gay people or Jewish people, or suppress assertive females, but please please let’s do it over a nice cup of tea”!

Yes people are getting rich and some people are getting jobs but the elephant in the room is that too many of those jobs are based directly or indirectly on debt and too few people are the recipients of the debt once it has been transformed into income by the state or banking system, so only a few, including politicians get rich.\nBonuses to house builders, EU bureaucrats Vice Chancellors of British Universities and state employees on over £100K per year all have a stake in taxpayer-funded debt. QE and the issuing of government Bonds assist the profitability of the banking system. No one is going to challenge the status quo when the status quo, the taxpayer-funded global debt model, is so lucrative to our “elite”.\nWhat is called “capitalism” today owes more to debt than capital (capital is economic value stolen from workers by capitalist’s, getting workers into debt to pay “capitalists” is not capitalism) but the elite doesn’t want anyone to know that.\nWithout the West’s governments taking tax from and thus indebting the poor taxpayer for centuries the system would have collapsed about a decade ago. The 2007/8 banking crisis was the most recent iteration of capitalisms terminal illness. Others collapses have been prevented by war or re-engineering the system as happened in the 1980’s.\nThe problem is that when the 1980’s collapse began the world was global so the Elite could export expensive work to China making the maximum profit from low production costs and stable sale prices at home. As prices stayed stable so inflation was stable but work was becoming a low skill and low pay issue so families needed subsidy and that comes from taxpayers too. So the bottom end of the economy is being subsidised and the elite’s and bankers are being continually bailed out as well.\nInitially, in 07/08 the bankers had to be bailed out…the systems death throes would have had a devastating social as well as catastrophic economic impact so immediate collapse had to be avoided. However rather than have a revolutionary overhaul of the whole system and staunch the excessive wealth and waste inherent within the elite’s crony economy, the state not only stepped in to stop the collapse, it continues to subsidize the whole “capitalist” system (banking, State and consumption). There is no one who is going to come forward to change this unless a quiet ballot based revolution takes place and those who can live on a realistic wage start to re-engineer the whole system for the benefit of everyone. Corbyns tax and spend is grist to the mill for the global elite and Farage’s sucking up to the EU shows just how far the global elite will go to consolidate their advantage over the rest of us.\nBlue Revolution is a quiet revolution, it’s a means by which ordinary people can get in on the political act by not having to go through the ideological indoctrination of the party system.

The council’s response betrays the typical reaction of a bureaucracy being defensive and camouflaging responsibility until stories have been straightened out. The lack of emotion from politicians suggests that they have finally mastered “disassociation” the psychological condition which renders ordinary people unworthy of concern or empathy. This is precisely the issue we at Blue Revolution have noted over the last seven years or so.\nPoliticians unavoidably represent the interests of their party and themselves. The party all too often reflects the interests of a lobby and special interest groups. The parliamentary system provides a framework for this disassociative process. Binary politics makes everyone prone to denounce opposition and makes every politician defensive and quick to condemn others or be condemned. This type of politics works when the binary system reflects the interests of two equally powerful interests groups but those interests (landowners, capitalist, or industrialised workers) no longer exist and whilst the system tries to reflect the needs of ordinary people, ordinary people are now too diverse so it can’t.\nBinary politics can’t deal with the complexity of the North Kensington community, it really does not and cannot connect with most of that community with its racial, cultural and class and age-related diverse dimensions.

  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_open-letter-to-black-lives-matter-a-british-marxist-perspective-from-blue-revolution/content_62.html": "Open Letter to Black Lives Matter\nOpen Letter to Black Lives Matter – A British Perspective from Blue Revolution.\nDear Black Lives Matter,\nHaving read about your organisation from your website it seems that your aim is not just to bring about greater harmony between people of different races by highlighting the disproportionate impact of structural inequality on the black community. Your aim seems to be to destroy what is described as ‘capitalism’, imperialism, patriarchy, and white supremacy. These terms can be understood in a variety of ways, but I choose to understand them from a classical Marxist perspective. As you appear to be offering a revolutionary social programme not too dissimilar to some programmes which were associated with nineteenth-century Marxism, it is important to remind ourselves that those programmes failed to preserve liberty and opportunity for all working people. With all twentieth-century type Marxist programmes, there is a risk that the programme will simply cause chaos and eventually bring about the end of freedom and liberty and return society to authoritarianism in the name of maintaining social order and the pursuit of the ‘idea’ of socialism.\nTo tackle inequality, unfairness and elitism, such as the domination of modern institutions by the upper middle classes people would be better off joining together rather than becoming alienated from one another and letting the elite off the hook by allowing them to think that structural inequality is caused by the white ‘far-right’ working-class discriminating against the black working class. Workers and ordinary people of all colours should unite around the world.\nCapitalism, as critiqued by Karl Marx was an inevitable phase of history and involved workers, under the veil of ‘bourgeois’ freedom being forced on pain of starvation to sell their labour-power, under contract to capitalists and thereby ‘freely’ accepting their own exploitation. Freedom itself was not the problem, it was the way the bourgeoisie used worker ‘freedom’ to effectively trap them into a world of low pay, with no welfare, no education, no healthcare, and no pensions. These were the issues for Marx. Freedom was a social good, but the absence of social provision coupled with low pay created a toxic economic environment that could only be addressed by collective action.\nToday we have retained our freedom and for the last eighty years enlightened governments, under pressure from workers, particularly in Europe, no longer allow ‘naked’ exploitation. We do not in Europe, or the United Kingdom have a wholly ‘capitalist’ domestic economy as Marx would have understood it. Our domestic economy is broadly what Marx would have called socialist and whilst there are still ‘structural problems’ that need addressing, those structural problems affect white people as well as black people and should be addressed by us together.\nWhilst the global economy is ‘capitalist’ it is hard to imagine how any movement will achieve anything without mass multiracial global cooperation by the worlds working classes. This is unlikely to be forthcoming in anything like the near future. The results will be that direct violent action only serves to reverse what achievements have been made on behalf of all workers so far. These achievements in the United Kingdom are not inconsiderable. There is also the risk that the process of direct action may destroy the freedoms all workers have achieved too and thus empower totalitarian nations to exploit western workers of all backgrounds.\nImperialism is understood by most on the traditional as well as classically Marxist left as the expansion of one nation’s economy by invasion into another nation’s markets by military force, otherwise known as colonialism. Western nations have been actively engaged in abandoning their old colonies, so colonialism is no longer an issue for the worlds free nations.\nWe have global capitalism largely unregulated and therefore widespread global trade. This has been called neo-colonialism. The need to invade to shore up collapsing national economies or to gain global influence is no longer necessary, global bodies like the World Trade Organisation make such action unnecessary and the United Nations renders such action illegal. But the drive for free trade or neo-colonialism is more complex. Whilst Marxists would agree that global capitalism has a corrosive effect on the planet and the lives of millions of people, by spreading trade, and peace, as well as freedom, and cooperation, global values are being promoted. Without the principles of capitalist freedom underpinning free trade, nations burdened by tyranny, a lack of democracy or oppression would struggle to liberate their people. Neo-Colonialism is, therefore, a two-edged sword. Like capitalism itself.\nDestroying imperialism is therefore unnecessary as it no longer goes on via military conquest. Destroying global capitalism is unlikely to happen at the moment as power structures inside and outside the western world remain largely indifferent to change. Failing to recognise capitalisms positive contributions, ignores the reality that many countries that were victims of past imperialism are now successful global traders and freely participating in the world economy, improving the lives of their people and introducing democracy. So Global capitalism is not wholly good, but it is not wholly bad either, as Marx said it is a phase in humanities evolution. It must be allowed to leave behind a legacy of freedom and democracy. If it were possible to destroy global capitalism by direct action in one country, for example, the United States, it may not actually serve the interests of the worlds, ordinary workers at this stage of humanities social and economic evolution.\nIn respect of patriarchy, this is a post tribal reality for females, being the control of females and their sexual behaviour with men, to control male personal wealth and power, its ownership and inheritance. There is now little control of females in the west for this purpose. Patriarchy exists in the world, but the western world does not control female’s sexual behaviour for any reason including the ownership and the inheritance of wealth. Females are considered the equals of males and this is enshrined in legislation. How do Black lives Matter propose to dismantle patriarchy without sending females back to a pre-patriarchal world where the only characteristic of interest to men was not the wealth females represented, but their simple collective reproductive capacity? This ambition of abolishing patriarchy sounds laudable but the implications for women are truly outrageous. Look at virtually every country outside of the west? You will see patriarchy being proudly promoted. It is particularly prevalent in the Islamic world.\nFinally, white supremacy. In my paragraph on capitalism above, I referred to ‘structural inequality’. This is best summed up as the institutional disparity in wealth and power between different groups in society. The impact of structural inequality impacts on both the poor white community and the poor black community. It might be more visible in the case of the black community but the exploitation of the working class historically, and the structural inequalities prevalent today in Britain affect white people and black people equally. There is nothing a poor white person can legally do which a poor black person cannot do but both can and are excluded from achieving a fulfilling life by our political and economic systems continued unfairness, elitism, and inequality.\nAmerica does not need a socially and economically destructive revolution it simply needs to develop as an interim phase of its history the kind of socialism that exists in the United Kingdom and Europe. The revolution will need to wait.\nBlue Revolution",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/https_abluerevolution_org_lessons-for-labour-and-the-tories/content_277.html": "Lessons for Labour and the Tories….and the rest!\nWhat happens when the democratic process in the Western world fails to deliver elected administrations that can run the State and preserve the Nation on behalf of her people? In the past the solution to the problem of failing States was revolution of a gory and bloody kind. In Britain and the US and elsewhere, whole Nations of people are struggling to find a party who is capable of reflecting the complex demands of the 21st in the way their Nation is run by their State. Nations of individuals all of whom have different demands and expectations, be they social or economic are thus being let down by their State. Just look at the long term unemployed to see this failure at its most stark.\nThe problem for the Labour party is that it is a party of the Socialist State, not a party of the individual. Marx stated clearly a socialist’s job was to wrestle power, wealth and privilege off of the capitalist and create a socialist State. This is basically what we have now, a State that since WWII has introduced a system of state ownership, regulation and welfare. However Marx also said the story concludes with the State “withering away”. This withering away is the transfer of power to the people. The Labour Party can’t do it because socialism makes it is a party of the State. It would have to abolish itself in the process of passing “power to the people”. So a State run by a Labour Party under Corbyn will consolidate power not give it away….Scary stuff if you listen to them ranting on.\nThe Tories are not wedded to the notion of the state running the Nation like an expensive ideological experiment as are Labour. However their pragmatism maintains the status quo in a fast moving world. Thus we are left tottering on the kerb as the rest of the world shoots by. The Tories need to grasp that being less ideological, it is they who are best placed to deliver more power to the Nation’s People. But they are unlikely to do so for similar reasons to Labour. Preservation of the party brand.\nTo save the British Nation, Labour need to get over themselves as a party and hand power to the people not their party and the Tories need to realise that the future of Britain and the survival of her values is more important than even the Tory Party.",

But how well do they protect our rights?\nAll societies need to possess two basic characteristics, the ability to create economic value as well as social coherence. In a nut shell the ability to feed and water themselves and the ability to live within their means and maintain social order. The creation of value is an economic activity that taps into the cohesive society to provide the labour necessary to survive as a population and thrive as a culture.\nIn the Western world, however, we no longer see the need to do this. Because we can maintain utterly incoherent societies and pay for them with a mixture of Wizard of Oz-like financial jiggery-pokery combined with some Alice in Wonderland economics. This is the system we at Blue Revolution call Secularwesternism. It is the prevalent ideology of the Western world. We all buy into it and governments are too scared or stupid to know how to change it or change our appetite for it and its unsustainable debt funded gobbling up of the planet’s resources. It is the most damaging and unsustainable ideology that has ever evolved and it will collapse leaving economic and social devastation in its wake. The western characteristics (Contract, Choice, and Consent) upon which democracy is founded, forged by Capitalism and extended by left-leaning capitalist governments to more and more people will disappear in a trice.\nThere are already those religious fanatics who can see the weakness of Western society and the shameful economic model that props it up and believe they can bomb us back into what is for them a more coherent “dark-ages”, but for us would be a Sharia inspired return to a pre 18th, 17th or even 16th Century world of prejudice and discrimination. Assuming, of course, you could maintain anything that resembled a “State”.\nUnfortunately for the devout Muslim with all their laudable devotions and traditional garb Sharia offers nothing “progressive” to the West, or anywhere for that matter. In this respect, it is no different to from the Old Testament. Islamism will stop Western progress in its tracks. But then Secularwesternism is doing the same thing but in a different way.\nIn addition to Islamism as an ideology jockeying to topple Western hegemony, we have the left wing getting in on the act. Now “the left” is an interesting hotchpotch of often incoherent ideas which have little basis in the economic reality of the Western world. So in China (and to some extent Russia), we have State Capitalism. This is the Capitalist System grafted onto an essentially feudal state. This is possible because unlike in industrializing Britain where Capitalism deposed feudalism confining it in the West to the historical dustbin, China can run the two systems in parallel.\nIn Britain, we have a collection of well-intentioned Mumsnetters and students who support Corbyn, the man who gives a well-meaning and harmless gloss to a party of Leninists, Stalinists anti-Semites, and Misogynists. The Corbyn Labour party is all about creating a Leninist like “Vanguard” (Momentum) seizing power on behalf of the “workers” and then re-ordering the “State” with a Stalinist like grip to deliver a new “socialist” society for the workers. It’s a horrible thought for us ordinary workers as it would turn Britain into a kind of bureaucratic hellhole, with workers, working to provide status and taxpayer-funded debt based wealth to an aggressive party elite. Rights would give way to the grand plan until the economy went pop.\nThe worst part of the Labour model is its complete lack of economic literacy. Unlike the Islamist who can see the absence of real social and economic value creation in the West, the British left still thinks the West makes real value from its coffee shops, restaurants and Malls selling tat, and that this value is controlled by a taxable business elite. No Guys, the West does not make real value based money it creates government and personal debt, and yes it does go to a business, banking and political elite that includes the Labour Party. And Labour would simply make the problem worse. Anti-austerity is the cause of the problem, not the solution. In the absence of real “re-appropriated value” to use a Marxist phrase, the only source of government finance apart from taxation is debt. The only way we can see to pay for schools and hospitals is to cut the cost of the State itself. But that, of course, is where the left wing gets their power from, now they have no Nationalised Industries to destroy. So we can’t expect a radical change there then!\nOn a more farcical note, we have the muddle of “Trumpism” which was (is) a nieve idea that somehow TPOTUS could order the US economy back to the 1950’s.\nThere is also Macronism, the nieve idea that Tony Blair was an enlightened thinker.\nIt is the workers, not the elite who will experience the horror of the West’s eventual demise and so far none of our pretenders to the Crown offers anything remotely realistic or in the case of Islamism humane. So rather than total economic and social collapse Blue Revolution offers its manifesto of increasing democracy in a shrinking state and an end to the rule of elites. Read our manifesto and join us before it is too late. As Karl Marx would say “raise your consciousness”.",

Every politician and pundit have identified the problem of the West’s lack of a narrative to counter-terrorism. The confusion over progressive values is that progressive values involve tolerating too readily regressive values such as anti Semitism or misogyny. In confusion over how to deal with primitive hate values are the so-called progressive left, an alliance of people who are united in hate of what is known as capitalism but which is, in reality, just a debt-funded “free market”. A free market that underpins the Wests freedoms.\nThe groups who hate this system either hate it because it confers rights to minorities they object to but for whom markets have developed to serve their needs, for example, the gay community. Or conversely, they don’t understand their own ideological confusion that the rights they enjoy, they enjoy because of the free market system they hate. This paradox is particularly marked on the left and partly explains Corbyn’s strange collection of incompatible ideological bedfellows.\nThis lack of coherence allows a moral fog to descend on the whole issue of individual rights and cultural expectations and confuses our understanding of the causes of the hatred of the West and thus impedes the West’s strategy or narrative for dealing with it. The modern liberal mind can’t square the circle.\nOk, so we will have a go. The West owes its existence like it or not, to capitalism, and in particular the 18th century and the codification of laws that created the legal freedom to contract choose and consent. All necessary for capitalism to work.\nBefore capitalism, we were bonded to masters. After capitalism, we were in a legal sense free people, the workers in the capitalist machine. The legal freedoms we acquired then and have extended since creating equality in law for minorities. These are missing from many of the world’s cultures today, particularly Islamic ones where gender, caste, tribe or wealth and status institutionalize discrimination. In these cultures, there is too often no right to contract freely to “follow your dreams”. They are pre-capitalist and pre-industrial. You only have to look at the culture of abuse and discrimination in Saudi Arabia to see how the pre-capitalist pre-industrial society works.\nSo the narrative for the West is to acknowledge the central role capitalism has played in creating our freedoms and whilst capitalism has its faults accept we owe our freedom to it and take pride in that. Even socialists can do this because without the productive energy of capitalism there would be no socialism. The west should then-champion the narrative of contract choice and consent and shame the bigots of whatever cultural hue into seeing themselves as regressive and at best 18th as opposed to the 21st century.\nThe bigots know that if you destroy the free market or we destroy it with debt, pre-industrial morals of control, coercion, and corruption become coherent. They the terrorists are trying to terrorize us back to their world so once again their values make sense.",

It’s so 20th Century!\nGosh it never ceases to amaze us just how 20th century our politicians are. ‘Cradle to grave wealth redistributive socialism and nationalisation from Labour as the Tories consolidate the middle ground and make it theirs with some post war one nation Conservatism. The dialogue between the two reflects a class war from Labour as the Tories critique tax and spend whilst speaking to the whole nation from the One Show sofa. What is wrong with all this is that it is all so 20th Century. But how so?\nWell not only does Macron speak about the failed political system so does Corbyn. In Corbyn and Labours’ case, they are accused of being Marxist, presumably because questioning parliamentarialism’ is the same as revolutionary communism in the minds of some Conservatives. But does Corbyn know this, does he know what parliamentarialism is, does he mean that parliamentarialism is the problem in modern Britain. However whilst policy comes in spade loads, spluttered out all half baked and barely understood by those communicating it, there is no solution offered to the problem of parliamentarialism. And parliamentarialism is a problem. Corbyn’s solution, like Macron’s is simply to get into parliament and to introduce a policy on say tax or nationalisation …..not to change the system.\nThe British Parliamentary system is a 200-year-old system which was always intended to be a representative model that allowed an ‘elite’ to manage the British nation on behalf of ‘the people’. Of course ‘the people’ were not the rag tag of bonded workers (a legacy of the feudal system) or the emerging proletariat, they would scarcely count as people at all. The people was a combination of the landowners and the emerging capitalist classes who identified with parties who represented them. From the Whig’s and Tories emerged the Liberals and Tories and then Tories and Labour. Each party reflecting the interests of different social ‘classes’ as history marched forward. The problem which 20th century Corbyn doesn’t understand and the Tories ignore is that we are too diverse and the economy too, fragmented to render our existing parliamentary system a good model for running the country. People feel that the ‘state’ and the parliamentary system fails the sniff test because to work a parliamentary system, has to bracket people into groups similar to classes and with modern diversity, people don’t see the full range of their interests or concerns being reflected in policy from either of the main parties, apart from Brexit that is. It gets worse once the party is in parliament due to the party system and the whip taking away the independence politicians should be allowed to have. Their naive, well-intentioned former selves become machined in the party system as a ‘career in politics’ beckons.\nThe radical solution is the Blue Revolution’s Legislative College. Taking national politics as close to the people as it is democratically possible to do.",

Ian Acheson’s piece was illuminating, highlighting as it did systemic and managerial failings in the running of British Jails. What baffles us, however, is the notion that there is no effective counter narrative with which to address Islamist ideology. Clearly advocating “British Values” has had limited effect in our culturally neurotic age. However, all democracies that are capitalist in origin, and some that are not, rely to some extent on the principles of contract, choice and consent to underpin their rights and freedoms. Is this not the “ideology” with which to beat the brutal, ignorant and unforgiving Islamist death cult, and re-educate their lost and misguided disciples who are in our prison system. No one should feel any shame promoting consent and choice irrespective of the colour of the person’s skin.\non behalf of ABlueRevolution.com",
  "http_abluerevolution_org_/http_abluerevolution_org_with-the-return-of-the-students-the-debate-about-pc-resumes-we-offer-a-comment/content_381.html": "With the return of the students the debate about PC resumes. We offer a comment.\nIn 2015 Oxford student Ntokozo Qwabe expressed the view that the statue of the patron of his Oxford scholarship should be removed as Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist and “looted Africa”. Ntokozo Qwabe’s view exemplifies the well-intentioned conflation of political correctness, moral relativism and anti-imperialism which has dominated the debate about Empire for a long time.\nOf course, Empire was and still is “problematic” but not always in the way imagined.\nWhen the likes of Rhodes and others took charge of parts of Africa they saw the potential to spread Christianity economic “freedom” and make money. Without being aware of it they proletarianised those who could be taken out of the tribe and placed in waged employment. Proletarianisation is the precursor of socialism.\nWith slavery diminished and urban tribalism in decline, these proletarianised workers were contracted or “freed” labour. They had, in theory, a choice for whom they worked. People will say that this was exploitation on a grand scale. We agree it is exploitation in a Marxian sense but disagree it was worse than tribalism if the end result became freedom from tribal oppression, particularly for women.\nWhat Rhodes and others did was replace the poverty brutality and sexual discrimination of tribal life, it’s uncertainty and ritualistic practices and allowed more modern values and agricultural techniques to generate greater economic value in Africa. Greater value than the indigenous population could hope to have created by repeating ancient rituals and superstitions.\nNow Ntokozo Qwabe makes a couple of points which whilst perhaps true, typify the limited and constrained nature of the debate. Firstly the value taken, what he describes as the “resources and labour of my people” were acquired by the Empire builders but they, in exchange, liberated people from what by modern standards would be seen as the horror of tribalism. Where this happened it spared some women the savagery of FGM and assisted people, in general, to create better lives for themselves. Well-intentioned westerners should reflect on tribal ritualism, gender-based and backed up by superstition before monstering Rhodes and his ilk.\nIn Africa and the Middle East today we have the collapse of feudal societies and their slide into tribalism. In Syria feudalism is sliding into tribalism and in Western inner cities, crime empires have for decades mirrored feudalism, now they resemble tribes. Capitalism has failed its global mission to proletarianised us all so the world can progress to socialism and beyond. Where this process has happened many more people benefit including Ntokozo Qwabe. Whilst not necessarily celebrating Rhodes we should at least have a balanced view of his and other Victorian’s long-term legacy.\nNtokozo Qwabe is benefitting from a western economic system that has liberated him and could go further and liberate his continent from religious separatism, tribalism fear and war if only he and others would stop bashing people like Rhodes.",

We comment\nThere is alleged bias and there is real bias. The room packed with a certain type of voter is an extreme version of alleged bias the subtly of the nuanced comment a milder and harder to support version of alleged bias. The policy of basing local constituency hustings on who is likely to form a government or the number of candidates a party is fielding nationally is real bias at a constituency level where the law rightly accepts all candidates are of equal merit. This is why the Post Office has to deliver one leaflet free of charge for all candidates and the democratic services team of the local council treats all candidates with equal respect…even independent ones. But this level of objectivity seems not to apply to the BBC where it is blatant and at constituency level, we think illegal bias. You simply can’t as a publicly funded body decide who to air and who not to! But the BBC does and when challenged at production team level the response can be patronising and disheartening.\nEveryone accepts the political ‘system is rigged’ but until we stood in this election it was not clear how aspects of that ‘rigging’ worked. One way it happens is that broadcasters and the media try and shoehorn diverse opinions into a creaky binary 18th-century political system complete with big binary parties of left and right and an electoral system, the first past the post system, that benefits binary politics. The ‘mother of all parliaments’ has given birth to systems like this all over the western world. No wonder from Trump to Corbyn the claim is made that the system fails the people. In the Anglo-Saxon sphere the, parliamentary system is a major contributor to the people’s democratic deficit. Here in the Uk, the BBC contributes too, by gaming their coverage in favour of the main parties and locking out new entrants to politics at constituency level. Add to this the Lobbying by Unions, big business and a picture emerge of a system which was not designed to work in the public’s interest but in the interest of the state and its wealthy supporters. The problem is that unlike in the 18th century where the ordinary person was illiterate had no vote and did not pay taxes now the people have all three! The system needs to change. This election more than any other is likely to see two party politics reinstated and that is bad for democracy and public anger.\nReform of the system is needed but in the case of the BBC this is not just Bias it is in our view an illegal rigging of the system and is one reason why we need a Blue Revolution.",
