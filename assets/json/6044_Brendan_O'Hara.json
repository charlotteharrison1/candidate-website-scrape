Local Marie Curie Nurses provide hands-on care and vital emotional support across the region enabling families to be cared for and to die at home, where that is their choice and appropriate for them.\nBrendan also heard about the plans to introduce a remote and rural Marie Curie Helper Service in Argyll and Bute, which will work alongside existing voluntary organisations in the area to provide one-to-one companionship, emotional and practical support, and information from trained volunteers.\nIn 2015/16 in NHS Highland area, 303 patients were supported in 2,301 visits by Marie Curie. This includes 964 visits in Argyll and Bute. Across Scotland in 2015/16 the charity provided care and support for more than 8,000 people living with a terminal illness through its hospices in Glasgow and Edinburgh and Nursing Service.\nBrendan O’Hara MP said: “Living in more rural parts of this constituency can be a challenge, albeit worthwhile in so many ways, but it doesn’t make you any less likely to need the support of organisations like Marie Curie. I am immensely grateful to the staff and volunteers for stepping in to help our more remote neighbours in Argyll and Bute. Their services can be transformative and mean so much to those coming to the end of their lives and as we all hope to do so, peacefully with the support they need at home.”\nNiall Kieran, Marie Curie Service Design Manager said: “We were delighted to speak to Brendan about the services we offer in Argyll and Bute. He was very supportive of the care and support we provide to local people through both our nursing service and volunteer Helper Service. If you are interested in working with, or volunteering for, Marie Curie or would like to discuss how we can support you in Argyll and Bute, please contact Niall Kieran on 0141 557 7536 or at Niall.Kieran@mariecurie.org.uk.”\nIf you or someone you know is living with a terminal illness and looking for support call the Marie Curie Support Line on 0800 090 2309. If you would like care and support from a Marie Curie Nurse contact your district nurse or GP.\nFor more information please contact: Gemma Smith Marie Curie Senior Media and PR Officer on 0131 561 3964 gemma.smith@mariecurie.org.uk\nMarie Curie – care and support through terminal illness – Marie Curie is the UK’s leading charity for people with any terminal illness.

The rise of violent Hindu religious nationalism means that “Christians are facing an existential threat” in India.\nReligious minorities particularly those living in rural areas, are afforded little or no protection from violent mobs. Even in a pandemic, the violence has not stopped. Christians and religious minorities continue to face systemic and relentless attacks. The escalation of this coordinated violence and discrimination represents an existential threat to the Indian church.\nOften violence and incitement to hatred are organised on social media. Despite appeals, social media companies have done nothing to stop or remove this content.\nI have agreed to meet with Open Doors to see how we in parliament can raise this issue with the giant Tech companies.\nTo learn more about the work of Open Doors and to read the report on India visit https://www.opendoorsuk.org/news/latest-news/india-destructive-lies/",

Cleophas and to hear how our local community here in Argyll is helping them change the lives of so many young people in one of the poorest areas of Lusaka.\nIt was wonderful to hear that because of the fund-raising efforts of ZamScotEd, coupled with dedication and commitment of Sr. Veronica and Fr. Cleophas, that so many young Zambian lives are being transformed through education.\nThanks to the generosity of people here, children in Zambia can now go to school and have the chance to break out of the cycle of poverty that sadly too many people are trapped in.\nZamEdScot is a wonderful charity doing amazing work and I am hugely grateful that they gave me the opportunity to meet Sr. Veronica and Fr.

ENABLE Scotland have been working with Jean’s Bothy to run a Writing for Wellbeing Group, and they have published their book ‘Peace of Mind’ in which members have used poems, stories, artwork and photographs to produce a publication on the theme of mental health.\nIt is always great to see the work that these fantastic organisations are doing and they are so beneficial to tackling social exclusion and creating more integrated communities.\nI then went to Hermitage Academy to meet with Mrs Rashid’s S1 Modern Studies class. The students had been putting together projects on democracy and dictatorships. To hear such in-depth analysis of the politics of places like North Korea was very impressive from such young folk, and it was such a pleasure as always to be invited in to this brilliant school.\nSaturday 25th – Oban\nOn Saturday, I went to Oban to take part in a litter pick and clean up of the Black Lynn, its banks and around the town of Oban. There were so many volunteers out helping on such a lovely morning from Adventure Oban, Keep Oban Beautiful and the Happy Wee Health Club. It really does show just how proud locals are of Oban and whilst I enjoyed taking part in the very therapeutic litter picking, I didn’t quite take the dive and get in the water.\nIt was great to have a catch up with members of the Oban Sailing Club and also to host an advice surgery where I could speak to folk about issues impacting them.",

I intend visiting Mr. Danielsen in the Faroe Islands next year with possibly Humza Yousaf, Minister for Transport and the Islands to see at first-hand how these tunnels are built and to see if such technology could be applied here in Argyll and other parts of Scotland to connect some or our islands and more remote parts of the constituency to the mainland”.\nHe went on to say,\n“Obviously things are at the very, very preliminary stages but I’d like to look at the similarities in the geology of Scotland and the Faroe Islands and I’d like to explore the possible benefits projects like this could bring to Scotland. We have promised to keep in touch and I very much look forward to meeting him again next year.”\nThe Faroe Islands are approximately 200 miles off the north west of Scotland and lies between Norway and Iceland and have been building tunnels since the 1960s. There are around 18 tunnels connecting their various islands ranging from 0.5km to 6km and with some more currently under construction.",

Eilidh Gammons who is only 8 years old and described as ‘being born to dance’ managed to knock up 4 firsts and win overall Scottish dancer in the championship with the talented Rhiannon Charles qualifying for the World Finals.\nOn meeting the girls, Mr O’Hara said,\n“I am delighted to meet the dancers today and have heard of their success over the years but they seem to be going from strength to strength. Achievements like this never come without sheer hard work and determination and meeting the dancers today, I can see they have got that in spades. They are a credit to their parents and to the Margaret Rose School of Dance and I’m sure the people of Helensburgh feel very proud of them too.”\nHe went on to pay tribute to the school’s founder and teacher Margaret MacInness by saying,\n“Margaret has not only introduced thousands of children over the years to the joys of dancing but has opened up fantastic opportunities for young people to aspire, compete and travel the world.

Worse, their numbers just don’t add up. There was no detail in the budget proposals and no breakdown of specific revenues generated from the car park, or the average time spent by visitors. This vast increase is just an arbitrary number”\n“No forecasting or detailed assessment of the income from the Arrochar carparks was available, if they don’t know even the basics, how can they possibly forecast revenues in the future?”\n“The budget proposals earlier in the year set the parking rise at 3%, there was no detail of this 800% rise. There has been no impact assessment done on the Arrochar car parks. This hike seems to have been simply pulled out of a hat.”\n“Worse still, the Tory/LibDem administration councillors just don’t seem to understand the distinction between an urban or rural carpark. The two are not the same”.\n“I am deeply concerned that this ill-conceived and illogical hike in charges could have a detrimental impact on visitors to our beautiful constituency. If the administration can’t get the basics like carpark charging right then I have serious cause for concern”.",

Bicentenary celebrations included a special-edition of just 522 bottles, to be sold by digital ballot, to raise funds for various community projects to mark the distillery’s legacy to the community on Islay.\nAll proceeds from the legacy bottling will be distributed to local projects, including a donation of £310,000 for Islay Heritage to help in its mission to build a comprehensive story of Islay’s past based on the island’s archaeological sites and monuments, including accessibility and interpretation of these sites. £60,000 will also go to support the Finlaggan Trust, responsible for maintaining the island’s most famous historical site at Finlaggan, the home of the Lords of the Isles. Contributions will also be made to other local community projects including the swimming pool, cyber café, arts and festival organisations and a new partnership with RSPB to restore and conserve peatlands on the island. In total the community legacy will total £580,000.\nBrendan O’Hara MP said:\n“Scotch whisky is a major contributor to the Scottish economy, it has immense international reach and is part of our cultural identity. We must not underestimate the contribution made by all our distilleries, large and small to Scotland”.\n“I was delighted to take part in this ballot, and I am delighted that the proceeds of the sale of each of these bottles is going back into the community, helping to secure the cultural and historic importance of Islay into the future and for that I must commend Lagavulin’s initiative”.\n“Whilst a huge fan of Scotch whisky, I am also chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Scotch whisky and brought a group of fellow parliamentarians to Islay last year to show them the importance of Islay to both the whisky industry but also as part of our shared heritage.”\n“I was delighted to secure my own special edition of the bicentenary bottle of Lagauvulin, However I could only take part in this ballot thanks to my wonderfully understanding wife and a very flexible friend in my pocket”.",

He also sought to find out if the officers involved were armed while on patrol and under what chain of command they report while on duty in civilian areas.\nCommenting, Brendan said\n“I am aware that there has long been a partnership between the MDP and Police Scotland and would expect no less in guarding the bases at Faslane and Coulport.\n“But the public rightly expect that in our local communities, it will be the civilian force, Police Scotland who are providing the law enforcement service and if that situation changes, for whatever reason they have a right to know why.”\nSo today I have asked the government why it has been deemed necessary to involve the MDP in civilian duties. Who took that decision that it was necessary? What discussion were had with Police Scotland before the decision was made.?\nWhat chain of command are the MDP working to while on duty in civilian areas and are the MDP officers working in the civilian communities around Helensburgh and Lomond armed?”",

The days of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ UK immigration policy are over. It has failed miserably to date and needs to change urgently.”",

It is striking that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister should choose this debate as the first occasion on which to appear at the Dispatch Box as Prime Minister to reinforce her personal will and determination to stand up for this country, to stand up for global peace and security and to demonstrate her personal resolve to project the values that our country represents around the world.\nIt is also striking that her very first act as Prime Minister was to pay respect to Scotland and the Scottish Executive by visiting the First Minister at the end of last week. If I may, I would like to address the Scottish dimension to the debate. The SNP is clearly represented in this House by many sincere unilateralists. No one need doubt their sincerity, but I very much doubt whether their views are as representative of Scottish opinion as they claim.\nA recent poll showed a majority in Scotland in favour of maintaining the nuclear deterrent. [Interruption.] SNP Members shake their heads, and they are entitled to do so—I would expect them to—but I put it to them that there are many reasons why the SNP is ascendant in Scottish politics, and I do not think that their defence policy is one of them. I think they would still be doing well in Scotland if they were in favour of maintaining the Trident nuclear deterrent. I do not think that the case of Trident renewal was uppermost in voters’ minds in Scotland at the time of the last general election or the Scottish election.\nBrendan O’Hara Shadow SNP Westminster Group Leader (Defence)\nPerhaps, given his in-depth knowledge of Scottish politics, the hon. Gentleman can explain my presence in the Chamber today as the Member of Parliament for Argyll and Bute, a constituency that includes both Faslane and Coulport.

Paul Buckley, Director of Strategy & Policy at the General Medical Council, has said that Scotland faces “particular challenges” attracting EEA doctors post-Brexit and is calling on the UK Government to provide urgent confirmation on the future medical registration process for European nationals.\nMr Buckley stated “We are concerned that with less than six months to go before EU exit and increasing talk of the possibility of a ‘no deal’ we still do not know how, and how quickly, EEA qualified doctors will be able to join the UK medical register. There is a risk that the continuing uncertainty will deter EEA doctors from coming to the UK & contributing to our NHS.”\nArgyll and Bute MP, Brendan O’Hara said:\n“This is damning evidence from the GMC and confirms that Brexit is the number one challenge to our health service particularly in rural Scotland such as here in Argyll and Bute where there are already issues in recruiting doctors. We are facing a double whammy here with Theresa May’s Brexit plans to cut off Scotland’s supply of highly skilled doctors and ignoring my plea to devolve immigration so that Scotland can recruit the highly skilled workers that are needed to keep our NHS going. This ‘one-size fits all’ immigration policy does not work for Scotland; doctors, nurses and health care staff from the EEA bring a wealth of valuable experience and skills to our NHS. We need and want them to come and live here.”\nHe added,\n“It is also why my Private Members Bill is so important right now. The Bill, which has cross-party support and the backing of 72 charities, will compel the UK government to consider the impact of any decisions they take as a result of Brexit, on our health and social sectors. “\nHe ended by saying,\n“It is why, I will along with the SNP colleagues will make sure our NHS does not become a casualty of this Tory government’s ideologically driven pursuit of leaving the EU.”",

In fact, despite the immense logistics, Scotland has made the fastest progress of any of the UK nations in extending superfast access\nThe latest figures from Ofcom show that in many urban areas, there is very nearly 100% coverage and the 95% target the Scottish Government set itself is on track to be met by the end of this year.\nOf course much of that remaining 5% will be in more remote areas Argyll and the Highlands and I and delighted that the Scottish Government’s R100 project will connect every home and business in the country with a universal service obligation of 30 megabits per second.\nOf course there are problems and of course people get frustrated. Broadband delivery in Scotland always faced immense hurdles, we have less population and our difficult geography causes immense logistical challenges.\nAnd that is why the Scottish Government intervened.\nWithout the Scottish Government investment, Argyll and Bute would still be lagging badly behind when it comes to superfast broadband.\nHad the Scottish Government not stepped in to fix the UK government’s mess, only 28.1% of premises had access to superfast broadband – that figure is now three times that with a commitment to connecting the remaining hard to reach premises by 2021.\nDigital communication was and remains a ‘reserved’ issue, one for which responsibility lies at Westminster, yet it has required direct intervention of the Scottish Government to ensure that our communities get the high-speed broadband they need.\nRemember, it was the UK Government who had the power to invest directly in high-speed infrastructure across the UK. They chose not to. Thankfully the Scottish Government was there to clean up their mess.",

As a member of the SNP’s COP26 leadership team, I have already met with many of these groups to hear their views and listen to the asks they have of world leaders. One thing we all have in common is that we must take action and every country around the globe must work together to do this.\nHe added: “Grassroots support is so important and it’s very often the smaller changes we make to our lives that will make all the difference. I have always been a fan of second-hand clothes and thanks to charity shops across Argyll & Bute most of the clothes I wear are second hand. It was great to be involved in Oxfam’s Second Hand September launch event and to see pre-owned clothing losing the stigma it once had, to become a statement of sustainability instead.\n“That’s why I’m pleased to be asked to back the #BuyBetter campaign which launched this week. This has evolved from Second Hand September and aims to raise awareness of the impact of throwaway or ‘fast’ fashion. People are also growing increasingly aware of the negative effects of unsustainable consumption more generally including food and plastic waste.\n“The pandemic has made things more difficult but as restrictions ease it’s more important than ever that we support our local shops, especially independent retailers, and shop on our own high streets, buying from charity shops where we can. Just as Government’s need to commit to leading the way in tackling climate change, it’s important we all do what we can as well.”\n“As part of that I’m pleased to see Scotland-based organisation Big Dreams, Little Footprints launch the #PollutionIsPants social media campaign celebrating second-hand/vintage/swapped/rented clothes and the need to keep clothes out of landfill, this week.\n“This is a great fun initiative that raises awareness of the range and quality of second-hand clothes and other items available.”\nMore information on the campaign is available from https://www.bigdreamslittlefootprints.org/pollution-is-pants",

It was an honour to have been invited to attend this solemn event and I congratulate everyone involved in allowing the communities of Southend and those from further afield, to come together to remember the terrible events of that night and to show their respects.”\nHe added;\n“I would also like to add my sincere thanks to the Church of Scotland and in particular, Rev.

The Scotch Whisky industry also accounts for 20 per cent of UK food and drink exports. It is a global success story, a major employer and an industry which supports a large supply chain.\nSince first being elected chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Whisky in 2015, I have worked hard to ensure that the industry is supported in the Westminster parliament and its interests promoted and its employees protected.\nthe Scotch whisky industry….has faced real challenges; none of which were of its own making.\nIn the midst of a global pandemic we have seen employees at many of our distilleries turn their hand to making hand sanitiser and other products which will benefit their communities. Their role in providing skilled work and contributing to the local economy is much valued but the industry is facing significant challenges ahead; challenges which could affect the jobs of hundreds of people across Scotland and the communities in which they live and work.\nSince the EU referendum result of June 2016, the Scotch whisky industry, which relies heavily on having a strong, reliable export market has faced real challenges; none of which were of its own making. Until now the industry has had all the benefits of free trade within the EU single market and has been able to take advantage of EU negotiated deals around the world. Now, with the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit looming, Scotland’s biggest export industry faces being hung out to dry by an incompetent government’s pig-headed refusal to negotiate properly with the European Union.\nIt is our small, independently owned distilleries, many who have invested everything into the US market, who will find this storm much, much more difficult to ride out.\nAdding to the uncertainty caused by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic is the totally unjustified and punitive 25% tariffs that the United States placed on Single Malt Scotch Whisky exactly one year ago today, as part of the continuing Airbus-Boeing dispute with the UK Government and the EU.\nDespite making the removal of these tariffs a priority and despite having the full support of the distillers, the trades unions and politicians from across parliament, the UK Government has failed to have their “special friend” in the White House move an inch on this matter, meaning the £360 million the industry has already lost due to US exports falling by a third in the last twelve months will be added to by £30 million for each month they remain in place.\nHowever, even a change in the administration on Capitol Hill won’t guarantee a speedy resolution to this situation as both the Speaker of the USA House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden have warned there will be “absolutely no chance” of a trade deal passing Congress should the UK Government break international law by overriding the EU Withdrawal Agreement and breaking International Law…something the UK Government has admitted their UK Internal Market Bill does.\nThese are extremely worrying times for the industry and while the big multi-national drinks companies such as Diageo and Beam Suntory – owners of our famous Bowmore and Lagavulin distilleries – may be able to absorb these extra costs, it is our small, independently owned distilleries, many who have invested everything into the US market, who will find this storm much, much more difficult to ride out.\nUltimately of course this will have impact on jobs and a few weeks ago, I convened a meeting of SNP MPs and representatives of trades unions including the GMB, which has been running a high-profile campaign to raise awareness of the tariffs and the impact this could have on communities across the country.\nI was delighted to be joined by no fewer than 17 SNP MP colleagues and to hear from them and trades union spokespeople about the impact this is having on the industry and the very real fear of job losses across the country.\nWe will continue to work closely with our friends in the GMB as well as reaching out to politicians and trades union representatives in the US, including Teamsters, American’s biggest union so that we can keep up the pressure to have Trump’s tariffs removed as quickly as we can, before this vital industry is damaged further .\nToday (Thursday, October 8) at International Trade Questions in the House of Commons, to mark the one-year anniversary of the Trump Tariffs, I asked why having promised so much a year ago, the UK government had delivered so little.

The date marks the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp.\nMr O’Hara said:\n“The experiences of survivors such as Joan remind us all about the importance of marking Holocaust Memorial Day – a day when we remember the millions of people who were affected by the Holocaust and subsequent genocides. We must do everything in our power to ensure that these things never happen again, anywhere in the world. It is why I am here today along with my colleague Ian Blackford MP to make a commitment to mark Holocaust Memorial Day every January and I want to encourage people in Argyll and Bute to do the same.”\nOlivia Marks-Woldman, Chief Executive of Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, said:\n“As the world becomes more fractured and divided, we need to come together to learn from genocide – for a better future”.",

The new trading arrangements post-Brexit with our biggest export market, on our doorstep, have made this market most costly, complex and high risk to supply to.\n“The detail in the TCA deal, which had virtually no time for scrutiny, continues to be hugely problematic, particularly in regard to sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. A top priority must be to reduce the scale of non-tariff barriers that have been introduced between the UK and EU and we consider the TCA deal as a cautionary tale in striking trade deals and then, on implementation, having to manage a range of significant and costly consequences.”",

The main aim however of this part of the dig is to reveal the walls of the nave so that Argyll’s cathedral can be seen by the community and visitors alike.\nMr O’Hara who joined dozens of volunteers said,\n“This is a fascinating piece of local history. Never did I expect when I took on the job of MP, I would be part of an archeological dig to uncover such a significant find as this. To think that we are looking back 700 years is quite astonishing and it just shows again what is going on here in Argyll and Bute. It is so important that we know our history and where we have come from”.\n“I would like to thank Bob and Claire for inviting me along today and with funding permitting I hope they will be able to continue with this next year. I would love to do it again.”\nImages: courtesy of Kevin McGlynn\nFor more information visit http://www.",

A copy of his speech is below and you can listen to it by clicking on the video link above.\n“I thank the Backbench Business Committee and Caroline Lucas for securing this debate, and everyone who has taken part in it this afternoon.\n“We are days away from the start of COP26—one of the most important gatherings of world leaders ever to have taken place. They are coming to Glasgow with one job: to make good on the promise to cut global emissions and restrict global warming to 1.5°C, and to give the world a fighting chance in the war against climate change, because right now it is a war that we are losing. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres pointed out just last month that the national determined contributions that have been submitted so far put us on track for 2.7°C. That is not nearly enough.\n“It is impossible to overstate the importance of COP26. Glasgow is possibly our last chance, because the world has not lived up to what it promised in Paris. We should be in absolutely no doubt that, if we are to make up for that lost decade, it will require leadership, it will take courage and it will mean sacrifice on the part of us all. But there is no alternative. There are no other options. It has to be done and it has to be done now.\n“As we have heard, the code red for humanity was absolutely clear: global climate change is accelerating, and human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the overwhelming cause of that climate change.\n“The UN Secretary-General said of that report—and who could disagree?—that this “must sound a death knell” for fossil fuels. Of course, he is not the first UN leader to highlight the issue of climate change. In 2016, his predecessor, Ban Ki-moon addressed the Arctic Circle Assembly and described the Arctic as the ground zero of climate change, highlighting that a temperature increase of 2° worldwide could well mean a temperature increase of 4°, 5°, 6° or even more in the Arctic.\n“Last week I attended the most recent Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik. Not surprisingly, the alarming rate of climate change experienced in the Arctic and the effects that it will have there, here and across the world were high on the agenda, with scientists confirming that, with just 20% of the Greenlandic ice sheet melting, global seas will rise by 2 metres.\n“Earlier this week, I attended yet another excellent meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on the polar regions, at which UK and US scientists working on the colossal Thwaites glacier in Antarctica spoke in detail of the evidence they have of that glacier melting and the billions of tonnes of ice that fall into the ocean every single year, with the inevitable rise in sea levels that will follow. That is a stark reminder that, although the Arctic and the Antarctic can sometimes seem remote, they are not, and what happens at the poles has huge consequences for the planet as a whole.\n“We are in a critical situation whereby the poles are melting, sea levels are rising and great swathes of the planet are rapidly becoming too hot for human habitation. Across the rest of the planet, already this year we have witnessed wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, and unparalleled levels of rainfall in Europe, Asia and Africa. Given what we have seen, surely no one could disagree with the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he said that we are “on a catastrophic path” and: “We can either save our world or condemn humanity to a hellish future.” That is why COP26 has to succeed.\n“Last night I met my constituents who had organised a meeting through Time for Change Argyll & Bute. They wanted to make sure that I, as their MP, knew exactly what they expected of me, of the Scottish Government and of the UK Government ahead of COP. That included telling the UK Government and the Prime Minister that they must now live up to what was promised in Paris and guarantee to restrict global warming to 1.5°—that there can be no more horse-trading and trying to fudge this issue, and that Glasgow has to be the turning point for the world that Paris should have been; now, tragically, it has to be seen as a squandered opportunity.\n“I know I am not alone in engaging with constituents on this issue. Last week my hon. Friend Patrick Grady, who has just escaped the Elections Bill Committee—taking one for the team to allow me to speak in this debate—spoke to his constituents in an online forum about exactly these issues.\n“COP26 cannot be Government to Government or business to business; as much as it possibly can, it has to be a people’s COP. Whether in Argyll and Bute or Glasgow North, the indigenous people of the rain forest, the Inuit people of Greenland and Canada or the people of the low-lying Pacific islands, the people of the world who are going to be most affected by this have to be heard, and not just heard but listened to, because for far too long the people who have least responsibility for creating this emergency are bearing the brunt of its consequences.\n“This morning I attended a meeting organised by Christian Aid to talk about loss and damage and what has to be a core principle of climate justice. We were joined by people from Bangladesh and Nigeria who spoke about exactly that—how the global north has created a problem that the global south is now having to live with, every single day. Between them, historically—it is important that we think in historical terms—the global north of the UK, Canada, Russia and the United States has produced 50% of the world’s harmful emissions, while Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen, Sierra Leone, Haiti, Chad, Niger, Malawi, Zambia and Madagascar, combined, have contributed 0.08% of harmful emissions. Yet today Madagascar is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years and is facing a catastrophic famine. It is a major problem for the global south, and we as the global north have to take responsibility for it.\n“Since 2020, Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, has suffered damages estimated at around $2 billion because of natural disasters, including cyclones, floods and rising sea levels.\n“I join my hon. Friend Deidre Brock in congratulating the Scottish Government on being so determined to make this a people’s COP and for setting up the world’s first climate justice fund to support vulnerable communities in Malawi, Zambia and Rwanda to address the impact of climate change.\n“It would send a wonderful message to the rest of the world if the United Kingdom Government set up their own climate justice fund ahead of COP26.”",

In fact, she’s the only leader in the UK showing any sort of leadership with both the Tories and Labour in disarray following last Thursday’s vote.\n“Talk of using the fallout from the referendum to railroad systematic cuts to Scotland’s budget is the worst sort of political opportunism from some right-wing Tory Brexiters – and is a grim insight into what Scotland can expect if Boris Johnson wins the Tory leadership.\n“It’s time for Ruth Davidson to finally stand up for Scotland – and condemn these undemocratic factions within her own party looking for any excuse to cut Scotland’s budget.”\nLink to tweet from David Bannerman MEP – https://twitter.com/DCBMEP/status/747102552374808576\nQuotes from pro-Brexit politicians regarding Barnett formula – https://gallery.mailchimp.com/4fae14f57a18ee08253ffc251/files/Brexit_politicians_on_Barnett.docx",

The Lib Dems can’t be trusted and would only let the Tories in through the backdoor.”\nENDS\nNotes for editors:\nA YouGov poll of Scottish Westminster voting intentions for The Times Scotland found support for the SNP at 43%, with the Tories 23-points behind on 20%, Labour 28-points behind on 15%, and the Lib Dems 31-points behind on just 12%",

We know from touring in the US and elsewhere, that visas and other restrictions impose significant costs and administration, and occasionally considerable financial loss when visas aren’t processed in time.

The Scottish fishing sector has been hugely struggling to employ enough deckhands and fishing related staff since the UK left the European Union. The combination of labour shortages, red-tape with the EU and convoluted visa processes has left the sector on its knees, and many fishermen have been forced to close their business over the past few years as this once thriving industry has become more and more difficult to make a living from.\nI have lost count of the number of times I have spoken about, or met with UK ministers to discuss the problems facing our inshore fishing fleet when it comes to employing foreign professional seafarers.\nThe latest Home Office guidelines mean that anyone coming to work inside the 12 mile limit will be refused a Skilled Worker visa to work as a deckhand unless they have passed a rigorous English language exam, one which requires them to speak, read, write and understand English to a very, very high standard.\nThe whole of the inshore fishing industry agrees that the standard set by the Home Office is completely unnecessary and is prohibitively high, meaning that the chronic shortage of labour will continue, and boats will be unable to go to sea.\nNo one is arguing that a basic requirement to understand and speak English is not a good thing, but the current B1 level test is a huge barrier to skippers and owners recruiting professional seafarers to come and work on their boats.\nI, along with other members representing large fishing communities, raised this issue yesterday.

Those who have backed the campaign include the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE), Camphill Scotland., UNISON, Disability Wales, British Association of Social Workers Northern Ireland and The Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA).\nLed by Brendan O’Hara MP, SNP member for Argyll and Bute, the debate heard that not a single one of the organisations who have backed the campaign feel that Brexit will be good for the health of the people in Britain.\nMr O’Hara said: “Without exception, every one of the 102 organisations that support the campaign have highlighted the enormous damage that Brexit, particularly the end of freedom of movement would do to their ability to deliver in the health and social care sector.\n“With every passing day, a disastrous no-deal situation looms even heavier on the Brexit horizon and we have no answers on the impact to the health and social care sectors. There will be consequences on the sector by the actions of the UK Prime Minister for failing to heed the serious warning of so many organisations. We owe it to the wider public to press ahead with this campaign.”\nAnna Fowlie, Chief Executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), said: “We would like to thank Brendan O’Hara MP and the other Members of Parliament who attended the debate to hear about the concerns raised by many of our members and other organisations across the UK.\n“The fears that many within the health and social care sector have over Brexit are widespread, and despite the Government stating contingency plans are in place this will to do little to reassure the 102 organisations who have backed the campaign.\n“We will continue to press for an independent review of the effect Brexit will have on health and social care. From increased costs for cancer patients to fears over drug shortages, it is vital that all of the concerns brought forward by the campaign are independently assessed and addressed.”\nDuring the debate, Minister for Health Stephen Hammond said the Government has contingency plans in place to ensure any challenges presented by Brexit are met.\nNeil Henery, Director of Camphill Scotland, said it is disappointing that no independent evaluation will seemingly be brought forward by the Government.\nHe said: “We are already seeing a significant drop in applications from European volunteers as a result of Brexit uncertainty. This seems like a terrible missed opportunity to start making the situation better.\n“We are grateful to Brendan O’Hara MP for his continuing support and confirm we remain committed to work with him and our partners to bring this work to fruition.”\nIan Welsh, Chief Executive, the ALLIANCE, said: “People with long term conditions and unpaid carers have told us their fears about the future of health and social care after any form of Brexit, with some planning for the risk that a no deal Brexit poses. We continue to support the Assess and Address campaign with the aim to ensure an independent evaluation and mitigation of our members concerns.”\nThe debate was held on the back of Private Member’s Bill that Mr O’Hara has tabled, calling for the independent evaluation.\nSo far, 102 organisations from across the UK have backed the calls for an independent assessment. The bill has also gained cross-party support from the Liberal Democrats, Labour, the Greens and Plaid Cymru.\nThe European Union Withdrawal (Evaluation of Effects on Health and Social Care Sectors) Bill was introduced to the chamber at the end of last year, and is due to have its Second Reading on 5 April.\nSUPPORTING QUOTES\nDr Donald Macaskill, CEO of Scottish Care, said:\n“The social care sector in Scotland, like the rest of the country, is desperate for some sort of resolution to the current crisis. Over 100,000 Scots access critical care services and these are at real risk from a non-deal situation. From issues of workforce stability, access to medicines, access to fresh food and the need for medical consumables – we have a real anxiety over whether we will be able to care for some of Scotland’s vulnerable citizens. We need resolution soon and we need our political leaders in Westminster to listen to our concerns rather than their own sound bites.”\nMark Hazelwood, Chief Executive of Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care, said:\n“Everyone dies, and we all want our loved ones to experience the best possible care. The Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care has looked very carefully at all the evidence. In terms of what is best for the care of people approaching the end of their lives it would be better to avoid Brexit. Our NHS and social care system is already “running on red” and we are extremely concerned about the negative impact of Brexit. In all likelihood Brexit will significantly damage the care which people receive. 57000 people die in Scotland every year, so this is not some minor issue. Should Brexit proceed it is vital that its impact is monitored so that government and other stakeholders can try to take ameliorative action.”\nMatt Barclay, Director of Operations Community Pharmacy Scotland, said:\n“This independent evaluation is vital to understand the impact on the health and social care sector of Brexit. Obviously for community pharmacy teams the focus will be to do their utmost to maintain everyday medicine supply to the public in conjunction with other partners in the supply chain. Our members will continue to deliver this important service for all who we serve including, often, the most vulnerable in society. For the wider system issues such as workforce, loss of EU funding, reciprocal healthcare and public health all the implications should be fully understood and explored across the services which provide important support to the public.”\nSheila Duffy, Chief Executive of ASH Scotland, said:\n“So much energy at Westminster and Holyrood is tied up in Brexit and its possible implications, yet there are still vast unknowns. In the case of corporations with health-harming products like tobacco these unknowns could represent catastrophic risks for people. Public health measures in general and tobacco reduction measures in particular are legitimate in their own terms, whether or not they affect the financial returns of industry. Lives now and in future depend on our recognising that people matter as much as profits, and taking as much care to scrutinise the public health impacts of Brexit as the impacts on business.”\nNOTES FOR EDITORS\nA full transcript of this week’s debate is available here.\nBrendan O’Hara MP has tabled a private member’s bill, the European Union Withdrawal (Evaluation of Effects on Health and Social Care Sectors) Bill, which is scheduled to receive its Second Reading in the House of Commons on 5 March 2019.\nThe Bill has cross party support in the House of Commons. Camphill Scotland, the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland, SCVO and partners totalling 102 organisations across the UK is urging organisations to ask their MP to support the bill.\nFor more information, contact Gareth Jones, Communications Officer at SCVO, on 0131 524 7285 or at gareth.jones@scvo.org.uk",

It will take determination. And sacrifice.”\nAs we can all see from the impact locally, nationally and internationally, global climate change is accelerating, and that human-caused emissions of carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gases is the overwhelming cause of that change.\nIn Argyll & Bute we have seen the damage caused by unprecedented rainfall on the hillside which towers over the A83 at the Rest & Be Thankful, and the huge impact this has had on the lives or everyone living near and using this important artery into Argyll.\nIt is vital that all developed countries to make good on their promise to support others’ transition away from producing planet-warming emissions and move away from supporting traditional fossil fuels.\nWe must also make sure this is a ‘people’s COP’ and give a voice to those who are most impacted by many of the devastating impacts of climate change. These are the poorest, most vulnerable countries who need help from the world’s largest economies.\nAnd while the ‘Code Red’ report is deeply worrying, it also offers a glimmer of hope that if we do take the right action by cutting emissions now, we can avoid a catastrophe.\nNow is the time for the UK Government to work with the devolved administrations and learn from the progressive, ambitious actions the Scottish and Welsh governments are taking to combat climate change.\nAs I said in my speech, “It is clear the nations of UK are not necessarily moving at the same speed, or with the same shared priorities or with the same degree of urgency as each other in respect to addressing climate change, and in that regard – and despite being the host of an event in Scotland, the Prime Minister does not speak for all of the UK on these matters.”\nTherefore, while it will be the UK Government that will be officially hosting COP26, it is hugely important, given that it is the governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast who are designing and implementing their own policies to tackle climate change, that all the nations of these islands are given a fair voice at COP26.\nScotland was among the first nations in the world to declare a climate and biodiversity emergency and Glasgow will provide a fantastic opportunity to showcase to the rest of the world our ambitious approach to tackling that climate emergency and achieve a net zero future.\nThis approach has led to Scotland recently managing to produce 97% of its electricity requirements from renewable sources and in the decade to 2018, Scotland reduced emissions by 31%; faster than any other nation of the UK and ahead of any G20 nation.\nAs well as learning from our ambitious policies and rapid progress that can be achieved, it is also vital that the UK Government backs planned developments in renewables capacity in Scotland, including the Scottish Cluster’s plans for carbon capture and storage at Peterhead.\nIt is also important the government gives serious consideration to involving the devolved administrations in the actual negotiations to deliver the most successful COP ever. This would show it was truly committed to working across the board to take the challenge of climate changes as seriously as it should and perhaps do something to enhance its recently diminished reputation for being a global leader.\nYou can hear more in my speech here:",

The bill has also gained cross-party support from the Liberal Democrats, Labour, the Greens and Plaid Cymru.\nThe European Union Withdrawal (Evaluation of Effects on Health and Social Care Sectors) Bill was introduced to the chamber by the SNP member for Argyll and Bute, who is hoping for other members to show their support for staff in the health and social care sector.\n“The unfolding shambles that is Brexit means that two years after the referendum, we still have no idea what the consequences will be for some of the most vulnerable people in the UK,” Mr O’Hara said.\n“Individuals, charities and organisations are all, understandably, extremely worried that the poorest and those least able to defend themselves, will be hardest hit by Brexit.\n“My Private Members Bill seeks to provide a safety-net as well as degree of reassurance whereby no later than one year after the UK has left the European Union, the Secretary of State will undertake an independent evaluation of the effect Brexit has had on the health and social care sectors across the United Kingdom.\n“The UK Government has nothing to fear from my bill. It simply seeks to provide transparency about how those likely to be hardest hit by Brexit are actually faring. I think it is informative and un-contentious, while providing a necessary safeguard to inform both the government and the public as to the reality of Brexit. “\nAnna Fowlie, Chief Executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), said: “If there’s one thing that’s clear about Brexit, it’s the potentially devastating impact on Scotland’s voluntary sector. SCVO’s members operating in social care and health have been very vocal on the need for contingency plans based on a proper analysis.\n“We are walking blind into a situation which affect medical research, the rights of disabled people and others, early access to medicines, EU nationals in our workforce and volunteering pool, all of which are vital to our communities.\n“The chaos that has unfolded over the last week means it is more important than ever to know what Brexit means for health and social care delivery. Mr O’Hara’s bill would be a real step forward in ensuring these crucial matters are subject to proper scrutiny and allow us to take all necessary action to ensure we are able to provide care, support and dignity for all.”\nDr Neil Henery, Director of Camphill Scotland, said: “The contribution of EU nationals to Camphill communities in Scotland cannot be over-estimated. Without them we could not provide essential education, care and support for people with learning disabilities and other support needs.\n“Any future restrictions on the ability of EU workers to make this contribution could have devastating consequences for Camphill and for the health and social care sectors across the UK.\n“Brendan O’Hara MP’s Private Member’s Bill would require the UK Government to make arrangements for an independent evaluation of the impact of Brexit on the health and social care sectors. This evaluation is essential if we are to safeguard the long term future of the health and social care sectors across the UK post-Brexit.”\nProfessor Ian Welsh OBE, Chief Executive, Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE), said: “ALLIANCE members have expressed concerns about the post-Brexit future for charities and communities, specifically relating to funding, the health and social care workforce, access to medicines, employment and human rights.\n“The combined impact of these issues has created an urgent need for evaluation of Brexit’s impact on health and social care systems across the UK to ensure these issues are well considered and unintended consequences mitigated.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors\nThe Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is the national body representing the interests of charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises.

Santander’s responded by referring to the ‘Access to Banking Standard’ and promised to let him have sight of their second impact assessment as soon as it was published.[2]\nSpeaking in a debate at Westminster last Thursday, the local MP said:\n“To justify the closure of its branch in Helensburgh, Santander’s review said that 59% of its customers have used online banking, mobile banking or telephone banking, which means, by its own calculation, 41% of its customers have not”.[3]\nCommenting on Saturday, the local MP said:\n“After speaking to scores of people on Saturday morning, I am in no doubt at the strength of feeling in the town. We will continue to campaign with this petition and if anyone would like to sign their name, calling on Santander to reverse their decision, they can call into my office on Colquhoun Square and add their names to a growing list”\n“Time and again, banks close their doors on the high street and expect the Post Office to simply pick up the slack.”\n“This is just the latest round of bank closures to hit communities across Scotland, coming at a time when many communities are being left cashless through the removal of hundreds of local ATMs. [4]\n“A few weeks ago, one local Post Office in Argyll and Bute actually ran out of money”.\n“Online banking and Post Offices are not adequate replacements for Santander’s most vulnerable customers. They do not provide the full range of day-to-day services that a local bank branch offers for businesses, customers, and those that depend on much-valued local employment.”\n“The UK government must step in and act. It can no longer argue that it cannot intervene.”\n“The UK government has an important role to play, and it is disappointing and telling that the Secretary of State for Scotland has snubbed offers of cross-party talks to find a solution that protects local jobs, local communities and small local businesses.”\nSources:\n[1] Hansard, 14th February 2019, http://bit.ly/2UZdkWm\n[1] Santander Response attached and undernoted.\n[1] Hansard , 14th February 2019, http://bit.ly/2SLbvQ4\n[1] “Scots battle to get cash” https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-47199311\nResponse to Brendan O’Hara MP from Santander:\n24 January 2018\nDear Mr O’Hara,\nThank you for your letter in reply to the notice that Santander is intending to close its branch in Helensburgh.\nI appreciate that the decision to close the branch will be disappointing for some customers. I can assure you that the branch team will be actively supporting customers that use the branch regularly to ensure they have alternative ways to bank with us after the branch closes.\nWe are working closely with the Post Office’s Operational team to ensure that Post Offices close to our closing branches are informed and supported during the transition. Whilst I understand that some customers have concerns over using the Post Office for their day to day banking, we have full confidence in the Post Office’s ability to fulfil this role. Indeed, expanding its banking capabilities is a key part of the Post Office’s business plan, with the increased revenues helping to support and maintain its national network of 11,500 branches.\nUnder the Access to Banking Standard, which governs the way in which banks close branches, banks communicate their decisions in two parts to customers. The first, the initial announcement of closure, must take place at least 12 weeks before the closure date and be accompanied by an Impact Assessment. We welcome feedback from our customers during this time. We will publish a second Impact Assessment at least two weeks before the closure date which will set out any concerns that have been raised by customers and provide advice on any specific issues or concerns that may have been raised. Any customers that have concerns over this closure should contact us so that we may ensure they are fully supported during this process.\nAlongside the initial Impact Assessment that I provided on Wednesday, I will provide you with a copy of the second Impact Assessment as soon as we publish it. In the meantime, if you have any further concerns please do let me know.\nYours sincerely,\nAdam Bishop\nHead of Branch Interactions\n[1] Hansard, 14th February 2019, http://bit.ly/2UZdkWm\n[2] Santander Response attached and undernoted.\n[3] Hansard , 14th February 2019, http://bit.ly/2SLbvQ4\n[4] “Scots battle to get cash” https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-47199311\nresponse Santander",

The SNP has urged the UK government to think again in light of the energy bills crisis and impeding hike in National Insurance contributions – and make the £20 a week uplift permanent as well as extending it to legacy benefits including Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support and Working Tax Credits.\nCommenting, Argyll & Bute MP Brendan O’Hara said:\n“It’s crucial that the UK government scraps the devastating Universal Credit cuts, which could slash the incomes of almost half a million Scottish families by £1040 from October.\n“At a time when energy bills and the cost of living are soaring, it would be unthinkable for the Tory government to go ahead with cuts that would decimate the incomes of around 6,126 local families across Argyll & Bute.\n“The UK is already suffering from a growing Tory poverty crisis, with the worst levels of poverty and inequality of any country in north west Europe – and the highest levels of in-work poverty this century as a direct result of Tory cuts, tax hikes and the cost of Brexit.\n“I am urging the Chancellor to U-turn on these Tory cuts, and instead make the £20 Universal Credit weekly uplift permanent and extend it to legacy benefits – as part of a wider package of measures to protect household incomes. £20 a week may not be much to a wealthy Tory MP, but to so many families the loss of £80 a month is very worrying indeed. It’s the money that can be used for food, heating and particularly in rural areas of Argyll & Bute, fuel. Access to your own transport is vital to so many people for education, employment and social interaction.\n“I will continue to press the UK government to reverse these damaging cuts but ultimately it is clear the only way to keep Scotland safe from Tory cuts is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to build a strong, fair and equal recovery.”",

The EU provided an uplift in funding as farmers and crofters in Scotland receive less per hectare than the EU average – but the Tories failed to pass the uplift on in full, short-changing Scotland by £160 million.\nThe UK government plans a power grab over agriculture – despite the Leave campaign promising that powers in devolved areas would automatically come to the Scottish Parliament after Brexit – raising fears of a repeated snub to Scottish farmers and crofters.\nThe National Farmers Union, Scotland (NFUS) have supported the Scottish Government’s position that all decisions affecting farming and food production in Scotland should be taken in Scotland.\nCommenting, Brendan O’Hara said:\n“Brexit is an enormous threat to Argyll and Bute farmers, who are deeply concerned over export markets, the future of farm support and ability to hire seasonal staff.\n“The Tories simply can’t be trusted after their brazen cash-grab of EU money from the pockets of Scottish farmers.\n“Scottish farmers and crofters have now endured 3 years of uncertainty about access to European markets for our beef, lamb and other produce.\n“On top of that, there is now the risk of our domestic market being flooded with food imports that don’t meet any of the high welfare and safety standards we farm to.\n“The European election is a chance to send a message to the Tories that Argyll and Bute doesn’t want Brexit. A vote for the SNP is a vote to make clear Scotland says No to Brexit and to protect Scottish farming.”",

This will have a huge and, very likely, detrimental impact on the health and social care sector which relies so much on citizens from across the EU being free to travel into the UK for work.\nOver the last few months I have been working on this clause, gaining support from over 50 different organisations across all 4 nations of the UK as well as support from colleagues in other parties.\nHowever, when it came to a vote this evening the clause was rejected by 344 votes to 247 with the Government benches unsurprisingly failing to accept or acknowledge that it is in everyone’s interests, including theirs, to review policy, especially a policy which has not been tested and one which will have such a huge impact on the delivery of health and social care across these islands.\nNo business would sign up to a contract as big as this without building in safeguards for review and I believe the UK Government should do the same. As we have seen over the last few months, access to health and social care is vital and we must be able to deliver it by making sure these sectors have access to a skilled workforce.\nThe full text of my speech is below:\n“Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I rise to move New Clause 1, in my name and in the name of the Hon Members listed on the Order paper.\n“New Clause 1 seeks an independent evaluation of the impact of the effects of this Bill, specifically on the Health and Social Care sector. And the reasoning behind this New Clause is that the faith that the Government clearly has in its new points-based immigration scheme, simply isn’t shared by tens of thousands of those working in the Health and Social Care Sector and millions of their service users, right across the UK.\n“As of this afternoon, no fewer than 50 organisation have given this New Clasue their backing. Organisations from every part of the United Kingdom including; The Bevan Foundation, The Church of Scotland, UNISON, The MS Society, The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, Disability Wales, The National Carers Organisation, The Welsh Council for Voluntary Action,The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, The Scottish Association of Social Workers, British Association of Social Workers in Wales and Northern Ireland, Voluntary Organisations’ Network North East and Camphill Scotland.\n“Mr. Speaker, all New Clause 1 asks is that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, having consulted with the relevant ministers in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as service providers and those requiring health and social care services, appoints an independent evaluator to assess the impact of this Bill on the sector and for Parliament to debate and then vote upon on that assessment.\n“By accepting New Clause 1, what the Government would be saying to the sector is, we hear what you are saying, we recognise your fears and your concerns but so confident are we that this new proposal will not adversely affect those caring for the weakest and the most vulnerable in our society, that we are happy to have an independent evaluation of the effect of these changes, once it has been implemented.\n“And I believe the reason this amendment has received such widespread support among the Health and Social Care Sector is because they, as the people who work on the front line simply cannot see how the ending of freedom of movement and the introduction of a Points-Based Immigration System is going help deliver a better service to the millions of people throughout the UK who rely on the Health and Social Care Sector every day of their lives.\n“And one can understand their concerns given that Sector is already struggling to recruit and retain the workforce it requires right now to look after an ageing population, with increasingly complex care needs.\n“Mr. Speaker, at the end of September 2019, NHS England reported having more than 120,000 unfilled posts – an increase of 22,000 from the year before. Unfortunately, it’s a pattern being seen right across the UK; a bad situation that’s getting worse.\n“And there is genuine concern in the Health and Social Care sector that the Government do not know what to do about it; a concern that only heightened by what’s contained in this Bill.\n“Of course, in and of itself, filling those existing vacancies will be a major challenge but it becomes ever more so if the UK Government are genuinely serious about fulfilling the Prime Minister’s pledge to “give every older person the dignity and security they deserve”.\n“To do that, not only would they need to fill those 120,000 vacancies but they’d have to vastly increase the number of people recruited into the Sector over a long and sustained period of time.\n“The Nuffield Trust have shown that providing just one hour care a day to older people with high needs, who currently get no help would require approximately 50,000 additional home care workers in England alone. And to give them two hours a day would require an extra 90,000 workers.\n“Add into that the fact that one in four of the current health and social care workforce are aged 55 plus, and are due to retire at some point in the next 10 years resulting in a further 320,000 vacancies – well Mr. Speaker, you can see why they are very worried indeed.\n“So, could the minister explain to me exactly how he believes this Bill and this new points-based immigration system will facilitate finding this army of extra Social Care workers?\n“Because I cannot see how it does and more importantly, no one I’ve spoken to in the Health and Social Care Sector sees how it can.\n“In fact, the common-held belief is that this Bill will make the recruitment of staff far more difficult and the delivery of what the UK Government claims it wants, well-nigh impossible.\n“Mr. Speaker, I have said it before, and I make no apology for repeating that Freedom of Movement has been good for this country and I bitterly regret seeing it go. It has been economically, socially and culturally beneficial and if the UK government are determined to abandon it, then the least it can do is make sure the weakest, the poorest and the most vulnerable are not disproportionally impacted by it.\n“I do not believe they have done that. I do not believe for a moment they have considered the impact of this Bill on the Health and Social Care sector.\n“But rather than trying to explain from the Dispatch Box how this Bill will not adversely affect the future workforce needs of the Health and Social care sector, the Government, by accepting New Clause 1, will have the chance to prove us all us doubters and nay-sayers wrong by allowing an open, transparent and independent evaluation of the impact of these changes.\n“By doing so, they will give the Health and Social Care sector the confidence that this Government does know what it is doing and that they have carefully considered what the ending of freedom of movement will mean and that have a plan in place to protect the sector and those who rely on it.\n“Surely the government – if it really is as confident about the efficacy of this new Immigration Bill and the points-based system as it claims – has absolutely nothing to fear from a comprehensive, independent evaluation; one that is there purely to assess the impact of this Bill on the Health and Social Care sectors in each of the four nations of the UK.\n“Indeed, I think it would be the prudent and responsible thing for the government to do, in order to ensure that any changes to the immigration system do not – however inadvertently – adversely affect the health and the care needs of our most vulnerable citizens.\n“And of course not only would this independent evaluation ensure that no harm was being done to those in receipt of Health and Social Care, but it would give any future government a head-start when planning and making decisions about the health and social care sectors, particularly in relation to recruitment of staff and levels of investment.\n“Surely the Minister accepts that such a far-reaching change should not happen on a wing and a prayer, without a proper, bespoke impact assessment or at the very least, an appropriate mechanism by which we are able to accurately measure the effectiveness – or otherwise – of such a radical change of policy.\n“Any business taking on such a fundamental change would have put in place means by which to measure precisely what it would mean to the business and its customers.\n“It is inconceivable therefore that the government is not doing something similar, particularly with something as important as the health and care of the country’s most vulnerable citizens.\n“Not only will New Clause 1 do that, but I believe it will also allow, in the future for a holistic and strategic approach to tackling the issues that will inevitably arise from the UK leaving the EU, and from the introduction of a Points-Based Immigration System, and would ensure that those issues are being tackled from a foundation of accurate and independent research; thereby allowing national Governments, local authorities, the health and social care sectors, the third sector and other key agencies across the UK to make strategic planning decisions, while being fully informed by evidence which is robust and independent – thus helping to secure the future of health and social care in the UK post Brexit.\n“Finally, Mr Speaker, I hope the Minister will see that the government has nothing to lose and lots to gain from agreeing to such an independent evaluation of the impact on the Health and Social care sector of the UK leaving the European Union.”",

When I invited her to come to Westminster she was so passionate and anyone who was in the room to hear her speak – was deeply moved.\n‘’We all came away with a greater understanding the full horrors of the way Daesh operate when Nadia told us about the kidnapping – trafficking and abuse of women – and the climate of terror and fear Daesh use to control people under their twisted control.\n‘’Her new role as a Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking is a tribute to all the work she has done.

The MGS provide unarmed guarding duties at MoD sites throughout the UK but the key sites on the Clyde are undoubtedly the most high-profile and pose the most notable security questions.\nThe MGS was formed following the Deal Barracks bomb attack in 1989, after the subsequent report identified serious failures in the private security firm provision at the site and recommended an in-house MoD guarding set-up.\nA PCS spokesperson said:\n“It’s an extremely dangerous path that the MoD are pursuing, risking the security at such important sites for negligible financial saving. We’re all aware of the appalling record of private security provision, including G4S’s inability to provide basic steward cover for the London Olympics in 2012, and their charging, along with Serco, for non-existent tagging of offenders. There are also licensing and security clearance issues that are unique to the MoD and which will complicate matters further.”\nThe case for going to the market and inviting bids is awaiting Cabinet Office approval and the expectation is that this will be granted. The MoD have their own In-House bid team which will compete against the private firms seeking to run the service and which is backed by the MoD trade unions. PCS remain sceptical, however, at the resources that will be allocated to this team and just how serious an effort the MoD will make to retain control of the service.\nPCS further maintain that any dilution of the crucial service provide by MGS could cause future serious security lapses at sites where nuclear hardware and material are present. They argue the need to retain the existing Defence expertise within the MGS ranks:\n“No one wants to see someone guarding Tesco on a Monday and nuclear subs on a Tuesday. These sites need a dedicated and professional guarding service and many of our MGS members have previous military experience and provide ‘Defence eyes’. The simple question is – why put the safety of these sites at risk for the peanuts savings on offer?”\nCommenting, Brendan O’Hara MP said:\n“Coming only days after promises to plough further public money into the Trident renewal programme and the increase of personnel to be transferred to the Faslane base over the next few years, we cannot – must not – play fast and loose with security at the base. The local community and the staff at both Faslane and Coulport must have absolute confidence that the facilities are secured by the very best security services available. This must be matched by the investments that are being placed in the renewal of Trident.",

And what a day it was. As it was our first such venture, we had set ourselves a target of getting approximately 40 members along to kick-start the event.\nAlthough I organised the event, this wasn’t my day. I wasn’t hosting it or leading the discussion. It was a day for the SNP members in Argyll & Bute to discuss, plan, organise and prepare for the future.\nThe meeting was due to start at 1300 and I couldn’t believe it when we turned up at 1200 to set up the rooms, there were already a couple of dozen folk waiting.\nI knew then we were going to exceed the target. But folk just kept arriving until by 1300 there were far too many folk to fit in the room and we had to hurriedly organise a bigger room. Even then, there were folk left standing outside in the corridor.\nWe had Branch representatives from Oban, Mid-Argyll, Tarbert, Campbeltown, Islay, Strachur, Holy Loch, Dunoon, Bute, Lomond North and Helensburgh.\nNo one managed an accurate headcount but judging by the group photograph and the fact that not everyone joined in the photo, a conservative estimate put the figure of 140 SNP members. Astonishing!\nI was delighted that Jim Mather, our former MSP could come along to facilitate the day and Mind Map the results.\nJim’s work in this area is amazing and before the large group broke down into six smaller groups, he outlined the broad themes to be discussed.\nThe whole idea of the day was to give members the chance to discuss in small groups a variety of themes; why have we been successful in Argyll & Bute, what is our purpose, what are we good at, what do we need to get better at doing and how do we deliver Argyll & Bute at the next independence referendum.\nFollowing lively and lengthy discussions, all the groups fed back into a plenary session. The results were fascinating and once Jim has tidied up his Mind Map, I will distribute it to every member of the party in the constituency.\nIdeally, this will lead to a more in-depth discussion at branches over the coming weeks with branches then feeding back their thoughts; thoughts that will inform the agenda for when we next meet.\nThe day was completed by the excellent Paul Kavanagh and his (not so) Wee Ginger Dug. Paul’s hilarious and insightful talk was the perfect was to round off a fantastic day.\nThe folk who were there agreed to hold our next Members Day on January 14th 2018, again in Inveraray.\nI’m delighted to tell everyone that a booking has been made and we will have the next Members Day on Sunday January 14th 1300-1700 at the Inveraray Inn.\nI’d like to put on record my thanks to the management and staff of the Loch Fyne Hotel. Without their enormous goodwill, cheerfulness and willingness to help, this afternoon could have been chaotic. We catered for 40…they got 140. Nothing was too much trouble for them and I am very, very grateful for all they did. But and I’m sure anyone who was there today will agree, if we get similar numbers in January, we will need a bigger room.\nFinally, thank you to every single SNP Member in Argyll & Bute who came along this afternoon. I hope you enjoyed it and found it as useful as I did.\nSee you on January 14th…and why not bring a friend.\nAll the best\nBrendan",

(Wednesday 28 March).\nThe petition which was launched by Mr O’Hara back in December last year, as soon as RBS announced their closure list, has gathered the signatures of several hundred local people.\nMr O’Hara said,\n“As I promised to do, I presented a petition on behalf of the people of Bute. Ten years ago the people of this community along with other UK taxpayers bailed out RBS to the tune of £50 billon and now without any consultation, they have decided that the Bute branch will close. I am genuinely amazed at the number of people who have signed this petition and only serves to show the strength of feeling that the community has that the Bute branch must remain open for business. My thanks to the local community for taking the time to sign the petition and all the businesses and shops that displayed it on their counters. They can be assured that I will continue to work with the community to make case for this bank to remain open for business.

We value your contribution, not just academically, but culturally, socially and economically.\n“I will fight tooth and nail and do everything I possibly can to ensure your position in Scotland is not in any way threatened by the madness engulfing the UK at the moment.”\n“Scotland overwhelmingly rejected Brexit, but we are cutting ourselves off from our friends and our allies; no good can come from this. The effect of Brexit in terms of Scotland would be disastrous but in terms of Argyll and Bute, it would be catastrophic. We desperately need people like you to come and work here, to put down roots and to stay. Brexit cuts the legs from that ideal and we are in danger of becoming a retirement home for the rich and the elderly.”\nFollowing the visit Brendan commented:\n“Research proves that there is no such thing as a good Brexit. If the UK leaves the EU, then Scotland and mainly rural area like Argyll and Bute will be worse off. A no-deal Brexit is not inevitable and I will do everything I can to avert that catastrophe “\nNotes\nThe Scottish Government has produced a package of support to help EU citizens. The ‘Stay in Scotland’ package includes £250,000 of dedicated resource for community-based support across Scotland and a support and advice service for all citizens affected by the UK Government’s EU Settlement Scheme delivered by Citizens Advice Scotland.\nPhoto credit – Kevin McGlynn",

Labour MSPs were the only party to vote against regulations which see the Carer’s Allowance rise by 2.4% from £64.60 to £66.15 per week.\nLast year, the Scottish Government introduced the Carer’s Allowance Supplement – an additional £442 a year to over 77,000 carers, and an investment of over £33 million in Scotland’s carers. This brought the level of financial support for carers in line with Jobseeker’s Allowance.\nCommenting, local MP Brendan O’Hara said:\n“It is shameful that Labour voted against a welcome increase in funding for carers, which would directly impact the lives of many in Scotland.\n“The Scottish Government has already uprated the supplement, and this change means that for the first time carers in Scotland will now get a higher level of support than Jobseeker’s Allowance. That is an extra £452.40 a year for carers compared to their counterparts outwith Scotland.\nPre-empting a backbench business debate at Westminster on Tuesday 19th March, local MP Brendan O’Hara has been reviewing the UK-wide difficulties facing those with care responsibilities who will likely face additional burdens with the potential loss of EU citizens in the health and care sectors. That debate and private members bill is calling for an independent evaluation of the impact of Brexit on health and social care. Brendan O’Hara added:\n“My private members bill, calling for an independent evaluation of the impact of Brexit on the Health and Social Care sectors has cross-party support with all but the tories recognising the risks facing our most vulnerable.”\n“Over 100 private sector organisations have added their support including Royal College of Nursing and Unison”\n“Unlike Labour, the SNP recognise the vital contribution that carers make to society, and will continue to recognise the work they do in our communities in what can often be difficult circumstances.\n“I cannot believe that the Labour party actually voted against carers today when they are facing a vastly increased burden of responsibility if the UK leaves the EU”.\n“Instead of these petty stunts, Labour should start working with the SNP to build a social security system with dignity and fairness at its heart.”\nBriefing paper 5 February 2019",
  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2021_01_28_building-links-with-our-arctic-neighbours/content_109.html": "This week the first ever UK parliamentary group dedicated to Greenland, took a huge step forward in building links with its Arctic neighbour.\nOn Tuesday the first official meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) Greenland, established by Argyll & Bute MP Brendan O’Hara just last month, had the honour of being addressed by the Greenlandic Minister of Foreign Affairs and Energy, Steen Lynge, and his deputy, Kenneth Hoegh.\nThe group aims to strengthen the UK-Greenland relationship on political, economic, social, cultural and scientific matters and to raise greater awareness about Greenland within the UK as well as promoting closer cooperation with the Greenlandic parliament (The Inatsisarsut).\nThere is a lot that we can learn from and share with Greenland, specifically looking at climate change and Arctic science, security and defence in the Arctic and in developing our long-established fishing trade links.\nAPPG Chair Brendan O’Hara MP\nThe formation of the APPG Greenland comes at a time when relationships with the Polar region are increasingly important for the UK. Forging closer links with the UK is also important to Greenland which, after previously enjoying tariff-free and quota-free access to the UK markets thanks to the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) agreement with the EU, is now facing some uncertainty in over its trading relationship post-Brexit.\nIn a presentation to the group, Deputy Minister Kenneth Hoegh said that talks had stalled over a trade deal and his government fears products from Greenland could now face new import tariffs to enter the UK. And while some temporary tariff suspensions have been put in place, they only apply to certain Greenlandic products with around just 24% of Greenlandic fish products qualifying for exemption.\nCurrently the UK is the destination for more than 10% of Greenland’s total exports, with several Greenlandic communities almost entirely reliant on fish exports to the UK – highlighting the importance of the relationship between the UK and Greenland.\nCommenting following the meeting, APPG Greenland chair Brendan O’Hara MP said the relationship between the UK and Greenland was vitally important.\nBrendan O’Hara MP said:“The UK’s relationship with Greenland is of the upmost importance – particularly after the Brexit deal and the ongoing trade deals with countries around the world.\n“On my previous visit to Greenland in 2018 I learnt a lot about the country, its government and views on independence.\n“There is a lot that we can learn from and share with Greenland, specifically looking at climate change and Arctic science, security and defence in the Arctic and in developing our long-established fishing trade links. In the future there may well be further opportunities too as Greenland’s economy grows and develops.\n“I am grateful for the huge amount of interest in this APPG, with over 44 MPs and Peers attending the meeting this week. This shows just how important it is to build a relationship with Greenland, it’s representatives and its people so we can learn more about this wonderful country and promote closer co-operation.”\nFor more information on the APPG Greenland visit https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/greenlands-foreign-minister-addresses-uk-parliamentarians-historic-meeting",

Not only will that be extremely bad for Argyll & Bute and Scotland but it is I believe, profoundly undemocratic. I have never said that the Europe Union was perfect but it is overwhelmingly in our economic interest to be part of it. The Scotch whisky industry needs a European market, Scotland’s farmers need the support of the EU and for an area experiencing depopulation, we need the ability to attract people and families from other parts of the continent in order to help kick-start our local economy.But above all, decades of close co-operation with our EU partners has kept the peace across a continent that has been at war with itself for centuries and working collaboratively with our EU partners, the UK has been able to provide assistance to democratic governments in Afghanistan, Ukraine and across Africa. Together as a European Union we were working to alleviate the refugee crisis in the Middle East and North Africa. All of that good work is undermined by Brexit and I fear our collective European security will be compromised as a result. Brexit has already been shown to be a slogan rather than a thought-out plan, and as a consequence of last Thursday’s vote there is now a full-blown political crisis in the UK with both the Tories and Labour in absolute disarray; with sackings, resignations, plots and in-fighting on an unprecedented scale. Thankfully we in Scotland continue to have a stable and competent government working hard to get us out of this mess and I fully support Nicola Sturgeon’s attempts to have the democratically expressed wish of the Scottish people respected by both London and Brussels and have Scotland’s position within the EU protected. I should also reiterate Nicola’s word of support to those EU citizens living in Scotland and acknowledge the contribution they make to our national life, to assure them that they are welcome here and that they are greatly valued. I am as determined as she is to say that Argyll & Bute remains open for business and people, regardless of their nationality will be made welcome here. As our First Minister said, in the days, weeks and months ahead we will consider all of the available options to avoid Scotland being dragged out the EU. As Nicola said, nothing is off the table and neither should it be. The SNP government will work with anyone and everyone to ensure that Scotland’s decision is respected and I urge the UK government and government across Europe have to take cognisance of what Scotland said on Thursday.",

Of the 13.6 million households who didn’t switch last year, 60% said it was because they believed they were already on the cheapest tariff available.\nBrendan O’Hara is supporting Big Energy Saving Week and encouraging local people to start saving on their bills by following a three step rule – check, switch, save.\nPeople are advised to check their current tariff and compare it with other suppliers, before switching to a cheaper deal if available. They are also given tips on how to save energy in their home and make it more energy efficient, such as not leaving the TV on standby or installing loft insulation.\nBrendan is also suggesting people use Citizens Advice’s online energy price comparison tool energycompare.citizensadvice.org.uk to compare different deals.\nCommenting, Brendan said:\n“The cost of energy bills can be a worry for many local people, especially in more rural areas where weather conditions can be extremely challenging over the winter.\n“Big Energy Saving Week is a great opportunity for people to find out about the different ways they can cut their spending on gas and electricity, whether that’s switching supplier or making their home more energy efficient.\n“I would encourage anyone who wants to find out how much money they could save to go online and compare prices, or contact their local Citizens Advice for help.”\n-ends-\nNotes to editors\n(1) The potential savings from switching energy supplier were calculated by Energy Saving Trust using figures from Ofgem on consumer behaviour between August 2015 and July 2016.\n(2) Energy Saving Trust worked with IPSOS to carry out a UK-wide survey asking 2,480 bill payers for information on their energy use. – Ends –\nNotes to Editors\n- Image file attached – No",

Our working age population is predicted to drop by a staggering 36.3% by 2026, an increase of 30% of those aged 75 or over and an overall drop in population of 3.4%[ii].\n“The simple fact is that without inward migration our working-age population will decline, making it harder to fund vital public services like hospitals and schools in the future.\n“It is now imperative for Scotland to have the powers to set an immigration policy which suits our specific needs and recognises the huge benefits migrant workers being to our economy and society.”\nENDS\nNINO Registrations To Adult Overseas Nationals Entering The UK (XI) | ||||\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLocal Authority | 2015 | 2018 | Change | % Change |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAberdeen City | 5205 | 2942 | 2263 | 43.47742555 |\nAberdeenshire | 1726 | 1000 | 726 | 42.06257242 |\nAngus | 1313 | 1090 | 223 | 16.98400609 |\nArgyll and Bute | 570 | 443 | 127 | 22.28070175 |\nCity of Edinburgh | 11927 | 10003 | 1924 | 16.13146642 |\nClackmannanshire | 113 | 78 | 35 | 30.97345133 |\nDumfries and Galloway | 336 | 260 | 76 | 22.61904762 |\nDundee City | 1338 | 1131 | 207 | 15.47085202 |\nEast Ayrshire | 92 | 89 | 3 | 3.260869565 |\nEast Dunbartonshire | 108 | 96 | 12 | 11.11111111 |\nEast Lothian | 514 | 499 | 15 | 2.918287938 |\nEast Renfrewshire | 141 | 119 | 22 | 15.60283688 |\nFalkirk | 544 | 323 | 221 | 40.625 |\nFife | 2619 | 1816 | 803 | 30.66055746 |\nGlasgow City | 9307 | 9901 | -594 | -6.382292898 |\nHighland | 1680 | 1425 | 255 | 15.17857143 |\nInverclyde | 104 | 66 | 38 | 36.53846154 |\nMidlothian | 240 | 265 | -25 | -10.41666667 |\nMoray | 313 | 227 | 86 | 27.47603834 |\nNa h-Eileanan Siar | 69 | 60 | 9 | 13.04347826 |\nNorth Ayrshire | 184 | 118 | 66 | 35.86956522 |\nNorth Lanarkshire | 1034 | 688 | 346 | 33.4622824 |\nOrkney Islands | 60 | 46 | 14 | 23.33333333 |\nPerth and Kinross | 2725 | 2031 | 694 | 25.46788991 |\nRenfrewshire | 746 | 662 | 84 | 11.26005362 |\nScottish Borders | 450 | 325 | 125 | 27.77777778 |\nShetland Islands | 301 | 93 | 208 | 69.10299003 |\nSouth Ayrshire | 280 | 194 | 86 | 30.71428571 |\nSouth Lanarkshire | 709 | 592 | 117 | 16.50211566 |\nStirling | 751 | 671 | 80 | 10.65246338 |\nWest Dunbartonshire | 193 | 106 | 87 | 45.07772021 |\nWest Lothian | 876 | 664 | 212 | 24.20091324 |\nScotland | 46567 | 38013 | 8554 | 18.36923143 |\nHolyrood’s Finance & Constitution Committee warns of strong evidence of a demographic risk to the size of Scottish budget\nhttps://www.parliament.scot/newsandmediacentre/110146.aspx\n[i] Prime Ministers Questions, House of Commons 5th September 2018, http://bit.ly/2HEMvUG\n[ii] NRS statistics for 2016, as reported by Argyll and Bute Council, https://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/info/nrs-2010-based-population-projections-argyll-and-bute",

Yet despite a number of inquiries into the circumstance of the crash, no definitive answer has been found as to why the helicopter crashed into a hillside near the village of Southend.\nOn Thursday in the House of Commons, the Argyll & Bute MP demanded the government make an urgent statement on what exactly they intend to do with the files.\nMr. O’Hara explained “Given the controversy that still surrounds the cause of this tragedy, I cannot understand why the MoD would ever consider this course of action. There are many grieving families who are determined to get to the truth of what happened that awful evening and if they dispose of these files, the government could be destroying the only pathway to establishing the truth.”\nHe continued “As we near the 25th anniversary of the tragedy, this MoD fuelled speculation is particularly insensitive and will only cause further unnecessary pain to the families at what will be an already very difficult and emotional time.”",

Her situation, rightly, commanded the attention of so many Members of Parliament, that is was standing room only. Member from across the House including myself and several of my colleagues, made impassioned pleas to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office Minister calling for him to do more to secure Nazanin’s release from an Iranian prison.\nThe inescapable conclusion must be that this government is not serious about securing the release of Nazanin…”\nThe government must pay its debt to Iran and secure the release of Nazanin and other UK nationals arbitrarily detained there too. They are being made hostages in a situation not of their own making.\nOver the last few weeks Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratcliffe has been staging a hunger strike outside the FCDO. The couple’s six year old daughter has been denied her mother. The government has to act. The MPs who spoke represent thousands of people across this country, including hundreds from Argyll & Bute, who have contacted me to express their dismay.\nI hope that following today’s debate, the FCDO heard that message loud and clear and will now act to bring Nazanin home.\nThis is what I said:\n“Last year it felt negotiations were at a delicate stage and where one misspoken word could set back the whole process, yet here we are, stuck in the same situation as we were a year ago. And the inescapable conclusion must be that this government are actually not serious about securing the release of Nazanin. They have had so many chances, so many opportunities and every one has been missed.\n“Twice I visited Richard during his hunger strike and I was struck by his resolve not to sit meekly back and wait for events to take their course.\n“The government are letting the people down. They are letting Nazanin down and there’s a six-year-old girl stuck in the middle here.\n“Minister, this isn’t good enough from your government. The public are not with you. Richard Ratcliffe is not going to go away and neither are his supporters in this House”.",

  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2021_07_14_5billion-cut-to-uk-foreign-aid-budget-will-devastate-developing-world/content_163.html": "Walking away from international responsibilities, “fundamentally wrong and morally repugnant”\nYesterday the Tories finally abandoned any pretence of a moral responsibility to the world’s poor by agreeing to cut £5 billion from the UK’s Foreign Aid budget.\nThis is an utterly shameful decision and will literally lead to many of the world’s poorest people being plunged further into poverty, slavery and destitution as well as leading to the further destabilisation of many parts of the developing world.\nAs I said in my speech these £5 billion cuts are fundamentally wrong and morally repugnant.\nBoris Johnson has brought shame on the UK by pressing ahead with these devastating cuts to international aid in the middle of a global pandemic. Not only has he broken his own manifesto commitment, and the UK’s moral responsibilities – but he has taken a course of action that will inevitably lead to more deaths and misery among the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people and prevent so many NGOs and charities from doing the vital, live-saving work they have been carrying out.\nI am grateful to all constituents across Argyll & Bute who have been in touch asking me to oppose this plan and glad that it is clear Scotland rejects these utterly shameful cuts.\nWhile the Tories are slashing aid at Westminster, the SNP government has increased our international development spending by 50%.\nDouglas Ross should explain why his Scottish Tory MPs have sided with Boris Johnson and voted against Scotland’s wishes, yet again.\nScotland’s values are increasingly under attack at Westminster. It’s clear that the only way to build a strong, fair and equal recovery, and play our full part in the world, is for Scotland to become an independent country.\nYou can read my full speech below and listen to it here:\n“May I begin by saying how pleased I am that the Government have finally bowed to pressure and that we in this House are having the vote that we were promised on cutting money to the world’s poorest people? It is absolutely right that we have that vote because every Member of this House must declare his or her position. I fear that, without a meaningful vote, Members on the Government Benches could continue to hide behind crocodile tears or meaningless words of regret, without ever having to display the courage of their convictions and stand up and tell this Government that the decision to take £5 billion away from the world’s poorest people is fundamentally wrong and morally repugnant.\n“At the end of this debate, we will all have to declare where we stand, and no one can continue in the hope that, by choosing to stay silent, he or she will not be asked to come off the fence. Although this vote has been a long time coming, it does mean that we are all in this House well rehearsed in the arguments. Absolutely no one can pretend that he or she does not know what they are voting for this evening, or that they do not understand the consequences of their actions when they vote. They now know that, if they support the motion, that money is not coming back.\n“I find it utterly incomprehensible that the Government of one of the richest countries in the world appear hellbent on making the poorest people on this planet even poorer and more susceptible and vulnerable to disease, hunger and the lack of clean water. For them to push this as vigorously as they have, despite every single analysis telling them and us that millions of people will die, simply beggars belief. It is shameful that, if the motion is agreed tonight, it will mark a new low point for a country that pretends or boasts about being a beacon for tolerance, decency and humanity. This is the test of that vote.\n“As I have said before, this country has a moral obligation to help those in what we now call the developing world, not least because this country is in no small way responsible for the situation in which they now find themselves. The UK — Great Britain —grew rich and powerful on the backs of the world’s poor. We invaded, conquered, divided and plundered, leaving behind an impoverished wasteland. It is about time that this country woke up to its moral responsibility to assist those we abandoned to live with the consequences of British imperialism. We should not be running away from that responsibility. Those on the Government Benches have to accept that that is the consequence of their action tonight.”",

The turnout at the polls was 72.4 per cent.\nA total of 142 votes were rejected. Ten were rejected for voting for more than one candidate and 132 were unmarked or void for uncertainty.\nThe Argyll and Bute UK general election count commenced after polls closed at 10pm on Thursday 12 December and was carried out through the night, with the result declared at 5.45am on Friday 13 December.\nAlongside postal votes and proxies, votes made their way across Argyll and Bute in ballot boxes transported by car, boat, and helicopter to be counted at Lochgilphead Joint Campus.\nReturning Officer Cleland Sneddon said: “The diverse geography of Argyll and Bute means that we have to carefully consider the logistics of any electoral count. Our ballot boxes are always transported by air, sea and land. This meant that, since this is a winter election, we had to factor in a number of contingency plans to deal with potential adverse weather conditions.\n“We had boats on standby in the event that the helicopters couldn’t deliver the ballot boxes from our islands to the count centre; our 4×4 vehicle were prepared for use if required; our gritting teams were on standby; arrangements were made to grit outside polling stations; and we had additional polling/counting staff on call.\n“We have a dedicated team of knowledgeable election staff which meant that everything went extremely smoothly, despite the unique challenges involved in administering a count on this scale. I would like to thank everyone involved for ensuring that Argyll and Bute’s UK general election count went so well.”",

It is essential that the people of Argyll & Bute speak out now and leave the government in absolutely no doubt as to the dire economic and social consequences that HPMAs would bring to our already economically fragile communities”\nENDS",

This Tory Government need to take meaningful action to support rural communities and stop playing postcode lottery with people’s lives.\nThat is why the SNP are calling for this new Committee, so that cross-party Parliamentarians can effectively scrutinise the Government, and make steps towards introducing legislation that protects those most vulnerable to this ongoing crisis.\nYou can view my full contribution below.",

Over two days, more than one thousand competitors and spectators descend on the island; an island whose population is usually around 40.\nI was delighted when the organisers asked me to blow the hooter to start the event, from a boat in the middle of the Sound of Kerrera as 220 hard as nails/mad as hatters but completely fearless tri-athletes swam from the mainland to the island.\nApparently it is the only triathlon in the world that starts with a swim to an island from the mainland.\nAmong the local hopefuls were Oban girls Alison MacVicar and Iona Paterson.\nAlthough the girls did exceptionally well and I caught up with them as they thundered past me on their mountain bikes an hour or so later, there was nothing they could do to stop the eventual winner, Andy King.\nOriginally from Glasgow, Andy who now lives in Aberdeen completed the gruelling swim, bike ride and run in an incredible 1 hour 32 minutes. And what made it all the more astonishing was the fact that this was Andy’s first ever Triathlon.\nWell done to Andy on coming first but huge congratulations to everyone who took part and making the day such a massive success.\nFinal word of thanks goes to local hero Duncan MacEachen and Durty Events for organising such a fantastic event.\nThe fun runners and the kids event is on tomorrow.

So many in our community have benefitted from their relationship with People’s Postcode Lottery and I would encourage any charity in Argyll and Bute looking for funding to sign up for this workshop as soon as possible.”\nCalum Munro, senior community programmes officer at People’s Postcode Lottery added: “We want to do all we can to help local charities and good causes successfully apply for funding.

It is crucial we focus on our energy strategy and climate plan and we can see from the First Ministers announcements today that we are on the right road to achieving a warmer, greener and more efficient ambition for Scotland.”\n“The reality is that many of our buildings are inefficient and hard to heat, which increases energy bills and wastes money. Fuel Poverty is a serious issue faced by many in Argyll and Bute and I am delighted that the Scottish Government is ensuring that we tackle fuel poverty by helping those on low incomes, while also working to reduce greenhouse emissions and protecting our environment.”\nThe Route Map outlines action to ensure that by 2040, all homes are improved so they achieve an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of at least Band C.\nSupported by the £54.4 million funding, landlords of privately rented homes will be required to achieve an Energy Performance Certificate rating of Band E from April 2020 at change of tenancy, and then Band D from 2022. All private rented properties will need to be EPC Band E by the end of March 2022 and Band D by the end of March 2025. This is aimed at ensuring that private tented tenants live in homes, which are warmer and more affordable to heat.\nFunding will also support local authorities to expand their existing energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes and it will continue to support building owners to develop local heat and energy efficiency strategies, as well as making funding available to social landlords to help install low carbon heating systems, such as air and ground source heat pumps.\nEnergy Efficient Scotland - Routemap exec summary - FINAL",

However, little is currently known about the exact numbers, location and needs of this significant group. Including new questions on the next census would provide public bodies, local authorities, and charities with valuable information to ensure they are able to deliver the best services they can for our Armed Forces community.\nBrendan met with representatives of The Royal British Legion, veterans and Service personnel to discuss the campaign in Parliament on Monday 13 June.\nBrendan said of the meeting: “It was a pleasure to meet with members of the Armed Forces community who, along with their families, make huge sacrifices in the service of our country. I also enjoyed meeting with staff from The Royal British Legion and hearing more about their Count Them In campaign.\nI was very disappointed to learn that we currently know more about the UK’s Jedi community than we do about our Armed Forces. It cannot be right that our Servicemen and women, veterans and their families are effectively hidden from official statistics, and that’s why I’m backing the call for new questions to be added to the next UK Census. We count on them – let’s count them in.”\nChris Simpkins, Director-General of The Royal British Legion, said: “As a nation we promise to provide lifelong care and support for those who serve our country. By adding questions to the 2021 UK Census, we can help public bodies and charities deliver the best services they can for our Armed Forces community, when and where it is needed most.

Poppyscotland is responsible for running the Scottish Poppy Appeal, which raises over £2.8m each year.

This makes this forum a great opportunity to allow owners to speak directly to Brendan about their experiences or to air their concerns about the complexities of looking after a listed building.\nBy law, owners of listed buildings must ensure that all building or maintenance works carried out on their property conforms to the standards demanded by their local Conservation Officer. Due to the nature of listed buildings this often means that owners incur greatly increased costs that would not apply to non-listed homes. Owners are also automatically liable for any unauthorised work carried out by previous owners, and can even be prosecuted if they fall foul of complex planning laws.\nWhile such rules are in place to protect the properties themselves, little or no consideration is given to the financial means of owners, who often cannot afford the extra expense; a situation that was worsened by the scrapping of zero rated VAT on approved alterations in 2012.\nBrendan says: “I am interested to hear my constituents’ views on how parliament can better serve the needs of listed property owners through actions such as reducing the VAT rate for work on listed buildings to 5%”\nFounder of The Listed Property Owners’ Club, Peter Anslow says: “After years of decisions going against them, listed property owners feel increasingly unsupported in looking after their buildings. This event will give owners the opportunity to tell their local MP about the challenges they face and how the loss of zero VAT has affected them.”\nLPOC has planned a number of forums throughout the UK, with the launch of the 2018 events being in Argyll and Bute; home to over 2000 listed properties. This event hopes not only to draw attention to such issues but will also give visitors the opportunity to gain invaluable free advice from listed property experts on topics such as what to look for when buying a listed building, listed building consent, insurance and more.\nThe Listed Property Owners’ Forum will be held at the Helensburgh Parish Church, Colquhoun Street, on Saturday 17th March 2018 from 10am – 2pm. All owners of listed buildings and anyone who is considering purchasing are welcome and can drop in at any time during the day. Visitors are asked to confirm their attendance by emailing their name and contact details to: events@lpoc.scot\nEditors notes:\nFor further information, images and feature support call Chloe Fosbraey on 01795 844939 or email chloe@lpoc.co.uk\nAbout The Listed Property Owners’ Club\nEstablished in 1993, The Listed Property Owners’ Club was created specifically to provide the owners of Britain’s protected buildings with information and advice on the maintenance, responsibilities and obligations of ownership. Additionally it provides a voice in Parliament to represent the views of its members. Members benefit from a bi-monthly magazine, a dedicated telephone helpline where you can speak to experts on conservation, VAT, law, planning, and insurance, plus the Suppliers Directory of professionals, builders and tradesmen, which is the first port of call for many listed building owners across the country.\nAbout LPOCs Political Campaign for Owners’\nThe Campaign for Owners is an ongoing crusade by The Listed Property Owners’ Club to help owners of listed buildings and draw attention to the issues surrounding listed property ownership. At the heart of our campaign is our work to engage with Westminster and to lobby the government to reduce VAT for all work on listed buildings to 5%. We are actively seeking support from policy makers and pushing to increase support for our newly formed All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Listed Properties.\nOur political campaign is funded by our insurance providers who pass a fee back to us for every new policy taken, which supports our efforts.\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/TheListedPropertyOwnersClub\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Listed_Property",

Within the UNCRC every child has the right to grow up healthy and thrive in a clean and safe environment (Article 24), a critical requirement for every child to grow, develop and learn to their full potential.\nResponding, Brendan O’Hara MP said:\n“Today, I have tabled a question to the UK Government to ask them “what assessment they have made of the economic impact of air pollution on vulnerable groups such as children who are disproportionately affected by toxic air in areas where they live, learn and play?”.\n“Nine schools[i] in Argyll and Bute are already part of the ‘Outright’ campaign and are actively campaigning for the rights of children and I am immensely proud of their awareness of the risks of air pollution specifically to children.”\n“Although I am challenging the UK Government, air quality is already devolved to the Scottish Government, who have already launched their air quality strategy titled ‘Cleaner Air for Scotland – the road to a Healthier Future’. “\nScottish government ministers recently ordered a review of the country’s air quality strategy. This was led by an expert in environmental policy, Professor Campbell Gemmell who has acknowledged the significant improvements already in Scotland.\nDespite this, poor air quality remains an issue in a number of towns and cities across Scotland and effective change is needed now so that all of us can breathe clean air and lead healthy lives in the future.\nBrendan O’Hara added: “The Scottish Governments ambition is that Scotland’s air quality is to be the best in Europe and I look forward to that ambition being realised. The Cleaner Air for Scotland strategy contains forty aims to realise this goal. We now need the UK Government to adopt the same levels of ambition.”\nThe World Health Organisation have recommended limit values for air pollution, the Scottish Government have adopted these values as one part of their action in this strategy.\nThe Scottish Government has also announced significant additional funding which will support the work of Cleaner Air for Scotland. £10.8 million has been provided to support the introduction of Low Emission Zones during 2018/19 along with £0.75 million to support local authorities with Air Quality Management Areas to develop transport-based actions.\nBrendan O’Hara MP added:\n“The active campaigning by so many of our local schools has undoubtedly had an impact on recognising the serious consequences of air pollution and I hope their efforts are recognised at Westminster for the good of all our young people across all four corners of the UK”.\n[i] Outright Campaign schools include: Ulva Primary School, Hermitage Primary School, Hermitage Academy, Rosneath Primary School, Campbeltown Grammar School, Lomond School, Sandbank Primary School, Dunoon Primary School and Dunoon Grammar School",

They have failed to listen to the anger and frustration that so many customers, businesses and communities have voiced about these cuts.”\n“Over Christmas and New Year I collected literally thousands of signatories on petitions for each of the three proposed closures in Argyll and Bute; neither RBS nor the UK Government seem to take these concerns seriously.”\n“These closure plans – which still mean the loss of dozens of branches across Scotland – will leave many communities without physical banking services, hitting rural areas who greatly depend on them.”\n“Quite simply, RBS are failing to consider their social responsibilities to rural and urban communities and to the long-lasting damage these closures will cause across Scotland.”\n“That is why the SNP will try to save these banks and it is time that other parties joined us in that campaign, to put pressure on the UK Government to work in Scotland’s interest, to force this public company to respect the communities that are in danger of being abandoned.”\nIn December, the majority taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland announced the decision to close 62 of its branches in Scotland, including those in Campbeltown, Rothesay and Inveraray.

Ten years ago the people of this community along with other UK taxpayers bailed out RBS to the tune of £50 billon and now without any consultation, they have decided that the Campbeltown branch will close.

This comes at a time when the local tourism industry is booming. RBS’ proposal contradicts everything that both the local authority, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Government are doing to boost rural communities such as Inveraray.\n“The tide is turning in favour of rural Argyll and Bute and just as we’re on the cusp of reviving our prospects, RBS’ proposal is a potential body-blow to the town. We need to speak out, now. After the bailout RBS received from each of us as taxpayers ten years ago, their actions now, at this time, is a grotesque breach of confidence.\n“I am furious at RBS’ lack of consideration for our constituencies well-being, we need each and every one of you to make your views known to Johnston Carmichael and make sure they are left in no doubt about the depth of feeling about this proposal.”\nAppointments with Johnston Carmichael can be made directly on their website at https://johnstoncarmichael.com/rbsbranchreview or To book an appointment, please telephone 01224 259 353 between the hours of 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.",

Not only is this a gross breech of their human rights but it also breaks the 1948 genocide convention.\nDisgracefully, all too often however, genocide goes unpunished because governments across the world simply find it easier not to declare a genocide because of the work they’d be legally obliged to undertake if they did call it out for what it is.\nThere are a few of us at Westminster, including Baroness Helena Kennedy KC and Lord David Alton, who with the support of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute are challenging that “turn-blind-eye approach”.\nNext week, together we will launch a brand new All-Party Parliamentary Group for International Law, Justice and Accountability, with the intention of bringing together parliamentarians, international human rights lawyers and academics to inform the government’s strategy and challenge the lack of one.\nIn 2023 we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of both the Genocide Convention and the universal declaration of human rights. In 2023, my sincere hope is that the coming year does give us something to actually celebrate.",

The North West Mull Community Woodland Company registered their interest in buying the island using the Scottish Government’s Community Right To Buy legislation and their chances of succeeding were boosted enormously last month with the award of £4.4 million from the Scottish Land Fund.\nLink to website https://www.ulvabuyout.scot/\nBefore exploring the island, Mr O’Hara met with Ulva resident Rebecca Munro and Colin J. Morrison, Chair of the Community Woodland Company to discuss their ambitious plans to repopulate the island by renovating existing buildings and attracting new business to Ulva.\nFollowing the meeting Mr. O’Hara said,\n“I was hugely impressed by the level of ambition the community have for Ulva. We need innovative and imaginative solutions to halt the depopulation of our islands and this community buyout certainly fits into that category.”\nHe added,\n“The community’s plans to provide housing with security of tenure, improve the infrastructure, expand forestry, fishing and agriculture and promote tourism while protecting the unique cultural heritage of the island is really exciting and will, I believe be a significant turning point in the history of Ulva.”\nMr. O’Hara concluded,\n“After many, many decades of depopulation and decline, I simply can’t see how the interests of Ulva would be best served by being transferred into the hands of yet another private owner. This community buyout project breaks that cycle and I sincerely hope that other communities will follow the example of the people of Ulva and explore taking back their land and running for the good of all in their community”\nDonations to the Ulva Community Buy Out Fund can be made by clicking here\nPhotos : courtesy of Kevin McGlynn",

That is vital for jobs, investment and our long-term prosperity, which are all seriously threatened by the hard Brexit now championed by the right-wing of the Tory party.\n“Some estimates show that after 10 years, a hard Brexit could mean the loss of 80,000 jobs and an average cut in wages of £2,000 a year.\n“It makes no sense for the UK to leave the Single Market and we’ve outlined how this could be achieved. But if that happens we’ve also set out how Scotland could remain in the single market if the rest of the UK leaves.\n“And in line with promises made by the Leave campaign and by the UK government since, our proposals include the transfer of substantial powers to the Scottish Parliament.\n“The Tory Government at Westminster says Scotland is an equal partner in the UK. It’s now time for them to prove that’s the case and back these plans to stop the disaster of a hard Brexit.”",

I was amazed at the quality of the work on display and I couldn’t believe it was all done by such young children. To be honest, despite the standard of painting, I had no intention of buying anything but when I saw Lola’s painting of a ballet dancer, I immediately loved it. Following some tough negotiations, Lola and I agreed a price and her painting will adorn in my office when I return to Westminster. It was a great pleasure meeting the young artists who were on hand to speak about their work and I would not be surprised if we hear an awful lot more about these young artists in the future”.\nArt tutor and artist in her own right, Karlyn Marshall added,\n“I am fortunate to have youngsters in my art classes who are keen to learn about art and have great potential as artists of the future. I was so proud of them all on the opening night of their first exhibition and particularly pleased for Lola on her first art sale.

Following the success of the national event Macmillan hosted a coffee morning in the House of Commons where MPs had the opportunity to hear about the challenges facing people living with and beyond cancer and to learn more about some of the services that Macmillan provides.\nBrendan attended the Commons event and said,\n“Macmillan’s coffee morning is a fantastic annual fixture and I was really glad to have the opportunity to attend one in parliament, albeit my hair only just reappearing after shaving it all off for Macmillan’s “Brave the Shave”. And it was also a great way to hear again about the support that Macmillan offers directly to people affected by cancer, having my brother recently diagnosed, I am acutely aware of the positive impact that support can have. With the number of people living with cancer increasing, this event is an important opportunity to not only raise funds for a worthy cause, but to bring people together to talk about an issue that will become more urgent in the future.”\nHaving raised £27million in 2015 and over £138million to date, the World’s Biggest Coffee Morning is the original and most successful charity fundraising event of its sort. The idea remains simple: get together with friends, colleagues or neighbours to hold a coffee morning and raise money for Macmillan, with every donation helping to ensure that no one faces cancer alone.

Drastic cuts are also being made to vital research, projects that bring so many benefits as well as employment both locally in Argyll & Bute as well as worldwide.\nI am grateful to my SNP colleagues Ian Blackford MP, Chris Law MP and Dr Philippa Whitford MP for also taking part in this emergency debate and standing up and telling the House that this cruel and devastating decision by the Tory government to renege on election promises as well as our international obligations during a world health crisis is not only beyond belief but will directly result in thousands of deaths. Instead, the UK government has given the green light for millions of pounds to be spent funding a new arsenal of nuclear weapons.\nBe in no doubt, this is a decision that will kill people. People are going to die as a direct result of this decision.\nThis is simply shameful and as Scottish MPs we would’ve hoped to see Scottish Tories stand up and voice their opposition. They did not. Instead, they were shamed by the likes of former Prime Minister Theresa May and former Secretary of State for Brexit, David Davies, amongst others who stood up to Boris Johnson and told him the UK’s reputation would be damaged irreparably on the global stage.\nAt a time when other countries are stepping up their funding, the UK is walking away from those most in need during a global pandemic. As Ian Blackford said in his speech, ‘none of us is safe until we are all safe’ and this means doing what we can to help those most in need of safety, security and sanitation, not abandoning them.\nHere is the link to the speech I gave in parliament and below is the full speech I intended to give but was cut short due to time restraints in the debate.\nThank you, Mr. Speaker,\nThe decision by this Government to take essential, life-saving money away from helping the world’s poorest people, is absolutely shameful and has confirmed once-and-for-all that “Global Britain” has already lost its moral compass.\nAnd for that idea to have emerged from an Integrated Review of Security simply beggar’s belief.\nThe idea that by making the world’s poorest people even poorer, somehow makes us safer is an absolute nonsense… and takes “gaslighting” to new extremes.\nDoes this Government really expect us to believe that the best way to make the people of the United Kingdom more safe and more secure is to slash vital humanitarian aid to those parts of the world which are already riven by conflict, war and famine, thereby forcing tens of millions of desperate people to uproot their families and go in search of a better, secure future?\nIt’s nonsense… and they know it is nonsense.\nAnd with breath-taking insensitivity to add insult to injury, that same Integrated Review announced that the money which should have gone on providing humanitarian aid to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people, should instead be spent on increasing the United Kingdom’s stockpile of nuclear warheads.\nMr Speaker,\nThe benches opposite might not like it, but this country has a fundamental moral obligation to help those countries in what we now call “the developing world”.\nNot just because we can afford to help them … which in itself is reason enough, but mainly because this country is in no small way responsible for the situation in which they now find themselves.\nFor more than a century, the United Kingdom grew rich and powerful on the backs of world’s poor.\nThe British Empire invaded, conquered, divided, and plundered half the world, very often leaving behind an impoverished wasteland in its wake.\nAnd so, it’s about time the UK woke up to the fact that it has a moral responsibility to assist those it abandoned to live with the consequences of British imperialism… not running away from that responsibility.\nMr. Speaker,\nThe decision to slash the Foreign Aid budget is wrong… very wrong; and what’s more, they know it is.\nThis isn’t like pulling the plug on the building of a new school.\nThis isn’t putting off the construction of a new by-pass because money is tight.\nThis isn’t suspending the restoration of the Palace of Westminster because we can no longer justify spending the billions it’ll cost.\nBe in no doubt, this is a decision that will kill people. People are going to die as a direct result of this decision.\nAsk any of the aid agencies. Ask any NGO you wish. Ask any government of the countries currently dependent on UK aid and they’ll tell you that some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world will die as a result of this decision.\nMr. Speaker,\nAt the end of this debate, anyone voting against this motion when the House divides later this afternoon, cannot pretend that they did not know.\nOr that they did not understand the consequences of their actions.\nMr Speaker, This isn’t global Britain; this is drawbridge Britain",

Does the Minister agree the only by enshrining annual targets in legislation, will this government be able to hope to meet its legally binding net zero emissions by 2050.”\nIt is so important we all do what we can and work together to do so. The Scottish Government has taken a leading role in reducing carbon emissions and most set the most ambitious statutory climate change targets of any country in the world for 2020, 2030 and 2040 with the aim of being completely carbon neutral by 2050 and it’s time the UK Government made the same firm commitment.\nTo read the CCC report click here https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-uk-emissions-2020-progress-report-to-parliament/",

That was avoidable and the failure of those councillors to back the SNP alternative budget will cause suffering throughout the area.\nHowever, strenuous efforts by communities and the opposition did force Dick Walsh and his administration to withdraw some of the most harmful proposals and to seek savings in areas such as councillor expenses, which originally the administration was not going to touch.\nI am also pleased that as a result of the hard work by John Swinney and the Scottish Government and efforts that I and my colleagues have been making over the past three months the administration has agreed to start on the long overdue process of transforming and decentralising services. Work will now commence on putting together a rural regeneration package with the Scottish Government and I am happy to continue to support that process.”\nBrendan O’Hara, SNP MP for Argyll and Bute added\n“Argyll and Bute would have been much better served by all the councillors backing the alternative budget proposed by the SNP Council Group. The Administration budget will cut deeply into communities and services across the area.\nNone the less our constructive work with the Scottish Government in trying to get the council to change and prepare for the future now appears to be taking route and I will continue to support that process.\nI am also pleased that the SNP council group has committed itself and the party to work with other opposition groups in order to push forward an agenda to change which gives hope for a better future after the council elections next year.”",

It is therefore unsurprising that, on the day that the UK had been due to leave the EU, new polling highlights the pivotal role that the issue of EU membership and Brexit is likely to play in any future Scottish independence referendum.\n“Progress Scotland’s new poll of more than 2,000 people in Scotland makes for interesting reading in understanding how voters view the relationship between Brexit and independence.\n“The importance of the EU as an issue which drives opinion on independence has doubled; 22% of voters put EU membership in the top two or three issues which determined their vote in 2014. Now, that figure is 43%, making it the single most important issue for voters in another referendum.\n“The poll provides further evidence of how the issue of the EU might impact on voters who have no firm position on the independence question.\n“The poll suggests that this cohort of ‘open-minded’ Scots has both strong views on the EU and is reassessing its views on independence in light of the Brexit debate.\nProgress Scotland Managing Director Angus Robertson said:\n“These findings illustrate the significant impact that Brexit is having on the views of open-minded people towards Scottish independence. These are just the initial findings from the inaugural large-scale opinion poll for Progress Scotland and more results will follow. This is just the beginning of our work, which over time will allow us to better understand an ever growing number of people in Scotland who are open-minded towards independence.\n“Many thanks to the thousands of existing subscribers who are making this important research possible.

The theme for this year’s commemorations is ‘Torn from Home’.\nAfter signing the Book of Commitment, Mr O’Hara commented:\n“Holocaust Memorial Day is an important opportunity for people from Argyll and Bute and across the country to reflect on the awful events of the Holocaust. As the Holocaust moves from living history, to ‘just’ history, it becomes ever more important that we take the time to remember the victims and also pay tribute to the survivors. In this uncertain world, we must never be\na by-stander in the face of hate and I would encourage my constituents to show their support for such an important day.”\nKaren Pollock MBE, Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said:\n“The Holocaust did not start in the gas chambers but with hate filled words. Our mission is to educate young people from every background about the Holocaust and its contemporary relevance. We are very grateful to Brendan O’Hara for signing the Book of Commitment, signalling a continued commitment to remembering the victims of the Holocaust as well as challenging antisemitism, prejudice and bigotry in all its forms.”",

Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.\n“The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.\n“The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland’s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger.

Even missing the target by 10% would see hundreds of thousands of EU nationals removed from the UK or placed in a situation where just leading a life would be impossible.\nThe SNP is also calling for the insecure concept of pre-settled status to be scrapped after figures revealed an alarming number of EU nationals were given this status instead of “settled” status, resulting in them having to face another application and more uncertainty in the future.\nCommenting, Argyll & Bute MP Brendan O’Hara said:\n“This statement from a UK minister is utterly deplorable. Instead of issuing threats to EU citizens who have spent years building their lives here, he should be focussing on supporting them to stay. EU citizens make an invaluable contribution to Argyll & Bute in terms of our culture and economy – we value their contribution and we want them to stay. I urge any EU citizens who are concerned about the direction of travel to get further information from the Scottish Government website, contact the Citizens Advice Bureau who have advisors who will help EU citizens or contact my office.\n“The UK government is completely ignoring this looming threat that would not only see thousands of of people being forced to leave their home in the UK, but leave thousands more unable to work, rent somewhere to live, access free healthcare, and open a bank account in order to continue living their life in the UK.\n“It is time the Tories at Westminster stopped playing with peoples’ lives and implement automatic permanent residence for EU nationals and family members already here, enshrined in law – otherwise, we may see a repeat of the Windrush scandal but on a much larger scale.”",

Brendan O’Hara, together with his SNP colleagues at Westminster and local agencies, have argued that the west coast of Scotland has been left vulnerable in the event of an emergency at sea.\nBrendan O’Hara said: “The West Coast of Scotland has been left vulnerable in the absence of the ETV, as a maritime nation and representing a particularly remote maritime geography, having a tug at our disposal remains an insurance against what is an unlikely but equally plausible event.”\n“Whilst the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) have concluded that a second tug vessel is not warranted, myself and my Highlands and Islands MP colleagues will continue to press the UK Government to re-think this matter. It was the UK Government’s decision to cut the ETV on the west coast and I hope that they will now listen to representations and take action to remedy this unfortunate situation.”\n“Reinstating an ETV on the west coast, at a relatively small cost to the UK Government, will help to protect lives at sea and also safeguard our precious environment”",

  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2021_03_15_the-pandemic-has-exposed-elements-in-our-world-that-need-fixing/content_84.html": "This is a piece I have written in support of the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill campaign.\nCOVID-19 has revealed a great deal about the world we live in. It’s shown us what works well—the vital role of our NHS, the kindness in our communities, and the life-saving scientific advances that have produced the vaccine. But the pandemic has also exposed elements that need fixing—and fast. Front and centre of these concerns is the dangers of climate change and the tragedy of ecological destruction: as Scotland begins to emerge from the pandemic, the climate-nature emergency must resume its place at the top of the political agenda.\nAs Glasgow prepares to host the UN COP26 conference in November, 2021 marks a unique opportunity for Scotland to be at the forefront of addressing these linked crises. COP26 is the most important summit on climate change since the 2015 Paris summit—and I’m proud to be co-lead for the SNP Westminster team in helping ensure that Scotland’s actions on climate and nature are lifted up for other nations to strive towards.\nIt’s for these reasons that I support the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill (CEE Bill) in Westminster. I’m proud to be amongst the first 100 MPs from across eight political parties in backing this revolutionary proposal. The CEE Bill is the only legislative plan before MPs that aims to address climate change while committing to restoring the UK’s ecological landscape. It creates a viable environmental strategy that many of us in Westminster have been crying out for—and it does it by involving citizens in that process.\nThe scale and severity of the climate and ecological emergency is stark for all to see—gone are the days of climate denialism. 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have taken place since 2000. Worldwide, over a million species are now threatened with extinction; more than ever before in human history. Action is needed now before it’s too late—but only last week MPs (again) called on the Westminster Government to provide detailed climate and nature plans before COP26—or risk the summit turning into an embarrassing failure.\nIn comparison, Scotland hasn’t shied away from addressing the crises. The SNP Government and First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, were the first in the UK to declare a climate emergency. Scotland has comprehensive emissions reductions legislation which already accounts for aviation and shipping, as the CEE Bill proposes for the UK. Given Scotland’s impressive record, I share the thoughts of so many of my colleagues who—during a recent CEE Bill debate—stated they hoped one day for Scotland to be an independent signatory to the Paris Agreement. Until then, COP26 is an immediate priority for the SNP—and Boris Johnson’s administration must lead by example to ensure that warm words turn into radical action.\nYet, as things currently stand, the UK Government is falling short on many of its own targets. The Climate Change Committee’s 2020 Progress Report found that only two of the 31 milestones for recommended actions have been fully achieved, with partial progress made on 15. 14 recommended actions—from replanting forests to insulating lofts—showed no progress at all. In addition, the UK is failing to meet 17 out of 20 biodiversity targets that were set back in 2010. This isn’t good enough—and they must do better.\nAll of this demonstrates why the CEE Bill is so crucial. If enacted, it would create a roadmap for the UK to meet its obligations in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels—while also conserving nature by restoring our soils and reducing species loss. The Bill would also create a representative citizens’ assembly, similar to the one here in Scotland, that will bring together people from across the UK nations, empowering them to propose the steps needed for us to transition to a zero carbon society in a fair and just way.\n31 SNP MPs now back the CEE Bill, representing the growing demand across Scotland for this much needed legislation to become law. The people of Scotland are serious about wanting urgent action to tackle the climate and ecological emergency, and I’m proud to echo their calls for action in Westminster. In this most crucial year for the planet, every day of inaction counts. It couldn’t be more important that MPs from all parties join the 100 who already support the CEE Bill—and push to make it law. Check out the #climate100 on the CEE Bill website—and join the campaign to get your local representatives to back this vital legislation. Our shared future depends on it.",

According to Mark Carney, Brexit has cost each household £900 and leaving the single market and customs union could cost Scotland 80,000 jobs.\nScottish Government analysis shows ‘hard-Brexit’ threatens to cost our economy £12.7 billion (£2,300 per person) a year by 2030, compared to remaining in the EU.\nReflecting on Theresa May’s statement today, local MP Brendan O’Hara added:\n“Theresa May’s statement added nothing to this Brexit debacle today. She was utterly humiliated in Salzburg. We’re two years down the line and no closer to a resolution. The single market / customs union membership must go back on the table. This is not a game, this is high stakes with businesses, consumers and citizens likely to bear the brunt of this tory gamble”.\nThe Scottish summary of the SBI is online here and the UK report is here. The survey was carried in The Herald, The Times, The Financial Times, The Sun and The Scotsman, amongst others.\n“Scottish small business confidence has fallen sharply and businesses north of the border are amongst the most concerned in the UK about a no deal Brexit, new figures from the FSB show.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, FSB’s Scottish Small Business Confidence Index fell from +5.1 points to -13.2 points. UK-wide, the Index, which measures business owners’ assessment of business conditions, fell from +12.9 points to -1.7 points.\nA separate FSB survey shows that 56 per cent of Scottish businesses believe a no transition, no deal Brexit would impact negatively on their business, whereas only 5 per cent believe it will have a positive impact. Of the remainder, 27 per cent of Scottish businesses believe such a move would have no impact, while 12 per cent of enterprises said they didn’t know.\nAcross the UK, 48 per cent of firms stated that they believe a no deal Brexit would impact their operations negatively. Only businesses in London have more significant concerns about a no deal Brexit than Scottish traders.\nFSB Scotland Policy Chair Andrew McRae said: “The slide in business optimism over the last three months is perhaps unsurprising given the very public debate about the future of the UK outside of the EU.\n“If you sell your products to the EU, buy goods from the EU or if your business relies on staff from the EU, you’ll likely to see a no deal Brexit as a significant threat to your business.\n“Businesses in Scotland are more likely to have concerns about this outcome.”\nOnly one in seven (14%) Scottish and UK small businesses have starting planning for a no-deal Brexit, the research shows. Almost a third (31%) of Scottish businesses say they plan to decrease investment ahead of March 2019. Further, the Index also shows Scottish businesses reporting pressure on revenues and profits, alongside a spike in overheads – with the cost of fuel cited by many.\nThe Index states: “While it is unclear exactly what role the Brexit negotiations is having on confidence levels, it would be surprising if the uncertainty around markets, supply chains and staffing was not feeding through to consumer and business sentiment.”\nAndrew McRae said: “Given the lack of clarity around future trading arrangements, it’s understandable that most Scottish small businesses haven’t yet starting preparing for a UK outside the EU.\n“What’s more worrying to see is the number of firms planning to postpone investment because of the associated uncertainty. We also see falling revenues and profits, compounded by rising utility and fuel costs.\n“The last three months of 2018 provide an opportunity for key decision makers to put our smaller business on a steadier footing. We must prepare our smaller firms for any change in trading conditions. They must do what they can to tackle spiralling overheads. We can’t crash out of the EU into a high-cost, low margin trading environment.”",

Since last week they have also refused to take meaningful action to stop their “friends” in Bahrain executing two more political prisoners despite worldwide condemnation.\nAlready the announcement by Dominic Raab that they were going to get tough with those who inflict pain and suffering on others, has now been exposed as worthless.\nToday in the House of Commons Urgent Questions were raised about the UK Government’s decision to re-establish the billion pound arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the potential this has for further devastation in Yemen.\nThe decision comes just over a year after the Court of Appeal ruled the UK government’s actions in selling arms to Saudi Arabia were “unlawful”.\nThere have been 17,640 UN documented civilian casualties in Yemen, including 6,872 dead and 10,768 injured. The majority of these casualties – 10,852 – resulted from airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition according to the UN. This included the deaths of dozens of schoolchildren on an airstrike of a school bus.\nMore than 200,000 Yemenis have been killed as a result of fighting or the humanitarian crisis which has ensued, and more than 20 million (out of a population of 29 million) need humanitarian assistance to survive.\nThere are also an estimated 1 million cases of Covid-19 in Yemen. This is a country on the brink of survival and the UK Government’s decision to put profit before peace now places the population in even greater danger.\nThe groundswell of international opinion, including the UN and most our allies, is clear that the arms trade to Saudi Arabia should be suspended due to its conduct in this war. Even parliamentary committees have questioned the legality and morality of the government’s position.\nThis afternoon I asked the Minister for State, International Trade, Greg Hands MP, about this change in Government policy.\nI said: “Isn’t it the truth, that it is business as usual for any regime, however brutal and undemocratic, as longs as their pockets are deep enough and where this government thinks it might have something to gain.\n“Isn’t that the squalid reality here?”\nMy SNP colleagues and I will continue to challenge the UK government in Westminster over this catastrophic failure of foreign policy and will hold it to account over its active role in this war.",

Brendan spent time meeting the team, touring the branch, learning about the services Nationwide offers and experiencing first-hand the latest technology that can help customers manage their finances in a way that suits them.\nOne of the services Mr O’Hara saw in action at the branch was Nationwide Now, the Society’s high definition video link to Nationwide financial consultants around the country, including an advisor hub in Dunfermline. The facility allows customers to complete mortgage applications and attend financial planning appointments at a time that suits them, without having to wait for an in-branch consultation – underlining Nationwide’s commitment to putting customers’ needs first.\nBrendan O’Hara MP, said: ‘I was delighted to have the opportunity to visit Nationwide in Oban. Having access to a national financial provider on the high street, which saves time, is very important for people in a rural constituency such as Argyll & Bute. It is great to see how Nationwide is embracing the latest technology, but at the same time not forgetting the importance of the human touch. “Hopefully, assuming Superfast Broadband is rolled out successfully and on time, this is a service that will act as a role model for the industry and will allow our rural Constituents the same level of advice and service that most in urban areas already have and take for granted. We need to see this industry adapt to its customers; this is a big step in the right direction”.\nWilliam Campbell, Oban Nationwide Branch Manager, said: “We were honoured to welcome Brendan O’Hara to our branch in Oban today. With one quarter of all new mortgage applications in the Nationwide branch network now being advised by Nationwide Now, this was a great opportunity for us to showcase the services we’re able to offer. Nationwide is investing £500m in its branch network, which will allow us to continually improve the service we provide.”\nMedia contacts:\nJonathan Minter, 01793 653423, Jonathan.Minter@nationwide.co.uk\nLindsay Price, 01793 652933, Lindsay.Price@nationwide.co.uk",

These efforts have resulted in unprecedented levels of engineering work being done over the past couple of years.\nBut what we have witnessed over the past few days – and with the West of Scotland predicted to become ever wetter due to climate change – shows that a long-term permanent solution to the A83 cannot come quickly enough.\nThe Scottish Government have shown themselves to be bold and ambitious both in the scale and scope of major infrastructure projects to support the local and national economy. One needs only look at the magnificent Queensferry Crossing for an example of that.\nI’ll be asking the Transport Minister to view the A83 in that same light, a vital economic artery for the West if Scotland that deserves the same level of support as the bridge over the Forth or the Aberdeen by-pass.”\n“Closures of the A83 leads to untenable diversions and rerouting of traffic onto other roads which are simply not designed to withstand these volumes of traffic. A solution to infrastructure investment to stem the flow of people and investment from the west coast must be found as a matter of urgency.”\n“The rural west of Scotland had suffered decades underinvestment and depopulation and while I’m extremely grateful for the work the Scottish Government have done thus far at the Rest and Be Thankful, we need a permanent solution and that means investment.”\n“I’m not an engineer and I would pretend to have to have all answers but the people of Argyll need a permanent solution. The repopulation and with it the economic regeneration of my constituency depends on a permanent solution and that’s what I am keen to discuss with the Minister as a matter of urgency”.",

What has also become apparent from today’s Reception has been the ability of all parties to work together for the greater good of Argyll and Bute, from a community organisation to Argyll and Bute Council to Highlands and Islands Enterprise and your Member of Parliament.

The new Defence procurement minister could give no assurances on the future of the contract – promised to the Clyde yards – and has once again placed in doubt the future of the programme.\nBrendan O’Hara MP had already asked the Defence Secretary on Monday if the massive expense of Trident and the recent analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that UK GDP might be reduced by up 3.5% as a result of the Brexit vote would result in a “black-hole” in the public finances of up to £40 billion in 2020, and what that meant for defence procurement. The Defence Secretary could give no answer.\nBrendan O’Hara MP commented:\n“This latest blow to the Type 26 programme is an absolute disgrace.\n“When I asked about the scale and range of cuts to the Defence budget because of Brexit and the huge cost of Trident – I got no answer. Today Harriet Baldwin has given us part of the answer. Her comments about the Type 26 programme will have been no comfort to the workers on the Clyde who now look like they are facing an indefinite delay .\n“This would be an utter betrayal to those workers – their families and the communities that depend on the work. We have had assurance after assurance from Tories at Westminster and Scotland and now we are facing the continuing uncertainty and mismanagement of this vital project.\n“The enormous cost of Trident appears to be spiralling out of control – and it would be completely unacceptable and unforgivable if the Clyde yards had to pay the price for the Tory obsession with Trident – a weapon of mass destruction that 58 0ut of Scotland 59 MPs opposed this week – and an economic black hole caused by Brexit.’’",

They’re missing from the register because they were either removed last year (and failed to re-register, individually) or because they believe, as is the case in many other democracies, that they’re automatically registered by the government.\n“The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Democratic Participation on the ‘Missing Millions’ presents tried and tested solutions to keep the register up-to-date all year round. In many countries, automatic registration is used to avoid last minute administrative crises – such as the GOV.uk crash and deadline extension – and prevent problems such as Barnet’s poll book disaster in May.\n“Automatic registration is a workable solution that must now be given proper consideration. Owen is entirely right to raise this issue now. This is the moment to evolve the foundations of our democracy, for the long-term.\n“The ‘Missing Millions’ recommendations, backed by Owen, 84 other MPs, Peers and AMs – must now be implemented without delay. Bite The Ballot calls on the Cabinet Office to listen to Owen’s case, and lead the charge.”",

  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2019_10_28_argyll-bute-msp-and-mp-joint-open-letter-to-cllr-aileen-morton/content_448.html": "RUSSELL AND O’HARA OFFER HELP TO THE COUNCIL , BUT ASK THAT THE COUNCIL BE “STRAIGHT” WITH LOCAL PEOPLE ABOUT BUDGET DIFFICULTIES AND CHOICES.\nBrendan O’Hara , the MP for Argyll & Bute and Michael Russell, the constituency MSP have issued a joint open letter to Argyll & Bute Council Leader, Cllr Aileen Morton, in which they offer to help the Council with its current budget difficulties, but ask that the Council be straight with local communities about both the reasons for the problems and potential solutions.\nThe Letter is given below :\nDear Aileen\nWe are responding to your recent consultation about the Council budget. We are doing so publicly because before we can give practical help (which we want to do ) we need to dispel some myths which have arisen including the public contention by you and your administration partners that the problems Argyll & Bute Council faces under your leadership are solely as a result of Scottish Government cuts.\nWhilst we are very sympathetic to the difficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster. In fact the Scottish Parliament and the SNP Scottish Government have consistently opposed austerity, even when it has been supported by Liberal Democrat and Tory MSPs at Holyrood.\nUnfortunately the truth of this matter is that your own party, the Liberal Democrats , was deeply involved in foisting this damaging policy on Scotland. It did so by going into Government at Westminster with the Tories for five years and voting as part of that UK coalition government to approve swinging cuts to the Scottish budget. It then continued to do so by failing to support successive Scottish budgets from the current Scottish Government.\nIt is also worth pointing out that your party, the Liberal Democrats, remain in coalition with the Tories in Argyll & Bute to the present day despite their awful record regarding public finances and public services.\nWe would also want to add some additional detailed information for local people to consider.\nFirstly, as we indicate above the Scottish Government has itself been subject to severe cuts in its funding from Westminster. Not including Health, (which must be excluded from all these calculations as the Scottish Government is committed to maintaining and indeed increasing that budget, and also applies all relevant consequentials to it ) the Scottish Government’s revenue budget is now 7.8% lower in real terms in 2019-20 compared to 2013-14.\nBut it is not correct to say, as you have recently done, that local government has been unfairly singled out for greater cuts these imposed on the Scottish Government because , over the same period, the Accounts Commission found that local government resource budgets had gone down by around 6% in real terms – almost two percent less than the cut imposed on Holyrood. And this year whilst the Scottish Government budget will further decline by 1.1% in real terms the local Government budget is actually going up , by 1.2%.\nThe truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for Local Government , as a share of the overall budget, at around 27%.\nSecondly the Scottish Government has gone even further to try and help local government . Councils have , once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the Council Tax, something they have sought for a long while. If they used this power the overall effect across Scotland would be a real terms increase of money for Council services of 3.8%.\nThirdly the individual share of the total funding allocated to councils is not decided by the Scottish Government but by COSLA using a needs based formula. Argyll & Bute Council will receive a total of £221.9 million to fund their services in 2019-20 which, taken along side the Council tax increase they have decided to implement , will give the council an additional £14.2 million this year compared to last – a rise of 6.8%.\nThey will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £141 million for teacher’s pay and and £60.8 million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.\nFinally the Council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects. You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions from individual local authorities regarding local government funding but has stressed that proposals must come from COSLA itself.\nYou and your administration could be more imaginative in re-configuring services and in particular in streamlining central management of them and devolving delivery and local decision making closer to local people.\nYou and your administration could maximise your sources of income whilst remembering that local businesses are the lifeblood of recovery and therefore doing so in a way that encourages development not deters it. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of where the wrong decision is likely to damage the economy and the earning power of the area, rather than enhance it.\nYou and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The Council has been slow to undertake any significant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships . In fact on occasion you have devoted huge time , money and effort in preventing asset transfer to an enthusiastic and committed local community , the case of Castle Toward being an obvious example.\nYou and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up difficulties for the future. The refusal to institute an independent examination of what went so badly wrong in that particular case continues to involve the council in a needless, expensive dispute with the vast majority of residents of Mull and Iona. A similar waste of Council time and money can be seen in the unnecessary fight about street lighting in Port Charlotte on Islay.\nYou and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services which are needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counter productive in terms of investing in our collective future and boosting local wellbeing, but will also lose the Council local sympathy and support which it needs to take forward its mission of helping and supporting the area.\nAnd you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £50 million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish & UK Governments – to make a long term difference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.\nAs your local constituency Parliamentarians we are completely committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to local government in Argyll & Bute and we will go on making that case alongside the case for more monies for the Scottish Government and all public services in Scotland .\nWe are always happy to work alongside , and in support of, the Council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the difficulties that the Council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government , and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.\nIn fact the Scottish Government is , and has been, working hard to assist Argyll & Bute and will go on doing so, as will we.\nBrendan O’Hara MP\nArgyll & Bute\nMichael Russell MSP\nArgyll & Bute\n———————————\nMichael Russell MSP for Argyll and Bute\nEmail: Michael.Russell.msp@parliament.scot<mailto:Michael.Russell.msp@parliament.scot>\nmichaelrussellmsp.scothttp://michaelrussellmsp.scot |@Feorlean | FB: Michael Russell–Argyll & Bute SNP\nConstituency Office: 81 Argyll Street, Dunoon, PA23 7DH – 01369 702011\nParliamentary Office: M4.16, The Scottish Parliament, Edinburgh, EH99 1SP – 0131 348 5738\nBrendan O’Hara MP for Argyll & Bute\nEmail:Brendan.ohara.mp@parliament.uk, @BrendanOHaraSNP , FB: Brendan O’Hara MP for Argyll & Bute\nParliamentary Office: 8 Colquhoun Square, Helensburgh, G84 8AD, 01436 670587",

Without calling a halt, there are fears for the wider impact when this is further rolled out in Argyll and Bute.\nResearch undertaken by the SNP revealed that local authorities across Scotland have spent several million pounds mitigating the damaging impact of Universal Credit – public money which has been diverted away from delivering vital local services.\nCommenting, local MP Brendan O’Hara said:\n“The Tories ‘flagship’ welfare policy isn’t working. Universal Credit is driving more people into poverty, causing severe hardship and stress and forcing people into relying upon foodbanks, just to get by.\n“It’s an unthinking, callous approach which victimises those who simply need an extra bit of help.\n“It would have been useful if the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions had perhaps come to Argyll and Bute on her whistle-stop tour of Scotland to visit some of our Constituents, in-work but relying on foodbanks just to feed their families, particularly in more rural locations. Despite overwhelming evidence, the Tories seem to be hell-bent on pursuing their flag-ship Universal Credit project despite all the warning signs of the devastating impact.\n“But the reality in Argyll and Bute, and across Scotland, is that where Universal Credit is failing, people are suffering – and the Scottish Government, local councils and the third sector are left to pick up the pieces.\n“It’s time to recognise that the rollout of Universal Credit has been a failure, the human price has been too high and the time is long overdue for it to be halted.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\nhttp://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15626147.Report_reveals_spike_in_rent_arrears_and_food_bank_use_as_a_result_of_Universal_Credit_rollout_in_Stirling/",

This support is crucial to jobs and our local economy.\nFunding will be offered to over 650 seafood fishing companies, many of whom have lost their livelihoods with the collapse of export and hospitality markets for Scottish delicacies like langoustine, prawns and crab.\nAn initial payment of 50% of two months’ average earnings will be made to owners of all full time Scottish registered fishing vessels of 12 metres length and under – the vast majority of which are in the creel and dive sectors, many of whom operate in remote and island communities.\nSupport is also being developed for the onshore processing industry – one of the largest employers in Scotland’s coastal communities – and others in the shellfish growing sector which is being affected by the loss of trade and markets.",

The SNP Group will challenge this increase by proposing a capped rate of £3 per day, bringing it more in line with Ben Nevis at £4 per day and Ben Lomond at £3 par day, both these car parks, unlike Arrochar, also offer toilets and other facilities.\nHelensburgh and Lomond councillors Shonny Paterson and Lorna Douglas have been inundated by objectors to the 800% increase and a petition “Petition Argyll and Bute Council against raising parking fees at Arrochar car parks by 800%” has reached almost 4000 signatures. Councillor Paterson, who also serves on the local mountain rescue team states “tourism is an essential part of our economy let alone the improvements to health and well being experienced by those who walk, run or cycle in our hills. Anything that deters tourists and locals from spending time in this most beautiful part of Scotland must be challenged and stopped”\nCouncillor Douglas added “Our motion will put a cap on the daily charge for vehicle owners at £3 per day. Many people from around the Helensburgh and Lomond area use these car parks more than once a week for recreation purposes and will often buy something to eat or drink in the hotels and shops afterwards supporting local businesses. Listening to the reasoned voice of public opinion is something we hope we can convince this administration is the common sense thing to do”. Cowal SNP Councillor Gordon Blair stated “the policy for setting parking charges was agreed at the last budget and following a review of charges this ridiculous level of charge was set. It is not in tablets of stone so it can be changed and we hope the administration will see sense and support this motion”",

Interviewees from 13 different EU states living in Scotland acknowledged that the atmosphere in the run up to the referendum was “not, or less hostile” than their experience of the aftermath in other parts of the UK.\nThe SNP has renewed its calls for the UK government to stop requiring EU nationals to apply to stay here – and instead automatically guarantee their rights in law.\nCommenting, Brendan O’Hara MP said:\n“I welcome the fact that EU citizens feel safer and more welcome in Scotland – their contributions are, indeed, valued and we want them to stay. EU citizens are valued and make a huge contribution to the economy and cultural diversity of my Argyll & Bute constituency”\n“This report is yet more evidence of the difference the fair and compassionate approach of the SNP Scottish Government is making compared to the hostile and insular approach of the Tories at Westminster.\n“The SNP will continue to stand up for and protect the rights of EU citizens – it is time the UK government followed suit by scrapping their hostile environment to ensure that all migrants in the UK feel welcomed and safe.\n“And most urgently, the Home Office must stop forcing EU nationals to apply to stay – their rights should be guaranteed automatically in law, without the need for an application.\n“If it will not, Scotland must have the full powers of independence so that we can put in place a system that treats our EU citizens with dignity and respect.”\nENDS\nNotes for editors:\nEU citizens feel safer in Scotland than in England –https://amp.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/eu-citizens-feel-safer-in-scotland-than-in-england-report-says?CMP=twt_gu&utm_medium=&utm_source=Twitter&__twitter_impression=true\nThe report can be found here – https://eurochildren.info/2019/09/16/coping-with-brexit-in-scotland-new-eurochildren-briefs-out-today/",

That is why events such as this are so important and I applaud the Royal Highland Education Trust for organising it. The demonstrations were great fun and it was lovely to see just how engaged the pupils of Rhu and Rosneath primaries were and how eagerly they took part in the activities.\nApart from RHET and the Scottish Government, a big thank you is also due to Luss Estates for making the farm available for this hugely worthwhile project and to the local farming community and the National Parks volunteers for turning out in such good numbers to make the children’s day so special”.\nRHET takes more than 16,500 children onto farms and estates throughout Scotland each year and as well as farm visits, RHET also arranges for volunteer farmers to visit the schools, provide free educational resources and organise school competitions and projects.The\nImage 1: Brendan O’Hara MP with Ross Stewart, Head Gamekeeper, Luss Estates; Lottie Colquhoun, Luss Estates; Sheila Bannerman, RHET Project Co-ordinator (Dumbarton, Lomond and Renfrew); Cllr Richard Trail\nImage 2: Ross Stewart, Head Gamekeeper, Luss Estates during a demonstration with pupils.\nMore information on RHET can be found on:\nhttps://www.rhet.org.uk/",

They rely on guaranteed, fast, unhindered access to markets, the ability to recruit crew for their boats and they need sufficient numbers of people to process their catch quickly and efficiently to dispatch it to where it needs to go – much of it to continental Europe.”\nHe added,\n“I fear that what is contained in the Government’s withdrawal agreement will not be happy reading for the industry. It does not provide for frictionless trade nor does it guarantee access to the workforce that they require. It is hugely worrying that this inept government are determined to embark on a course which put this industry at risk and puts Scotland and my constituency at a competitive disadvantage particularly with Northern Ireland who will keep a foothold in the EU regardless.”\nThese fears were echoed by the Chief Executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers’ Organisation, Julie Hesketh-Laird when she said,\n“This document raises the prospect of tariffs being imposed on exports if there is no agreement on North Sea fish quotas.

Given that they had to go cap-in-hand to the taxpayer, I think they should better understand their social responsibility to the people of Rothesay, Campbeltown and Inveraray. “\nPromising to work with anyone and everyone to get this decision reversed, Mr O’Hara continued;\n“This is a shameful betrayal of rural Scotland and I have launched a petition; one for each town that I shall take to the floor of the House of Commons, demanding that the Chancellor intervenes on behalf of the taxpayer to halt these plans”\nImmediately following the closure announcement, the Argyll & Bute MP lodged a motion at Westminster condemning the closure and will raise the matter on Monday 18th December in a debate being led by SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford MP, for Ross, Skye and Lochaber.\nSpeaking at the launch of the Inveraray petition on Friday 8th December 2017, Brendan O’Hara added:\n“I spent most of Friday in Inveraray talking to people and business owners about the proposed closure of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the last remaining bank in the town.\nI’d like to thank Donald Clark, proprietor of the George Hotel and Marian Pallister, the award winning journalist and author for being the first names on the petition.\nI visited many businesses in the town and I was delighted that every single business I visited took a pile of petition forms to have on their front counters in the run up to Christmas.\nIndeed such was the demand for forms that I ran out and will have to go back up to Inveraray to deliver more.\nI can honestly say I have never before experienced such widespread anger in a community and I can’t blame them.\nIf this ridiculous closure plan happens, then Inveraray, an internationally recognised tourism hot-spot, with a least three substantial hotels, numerous cafes, bars, gift shops, quality clothing retailers and a castle, will have absolutely no banking facilities whatsoever.\nI’m sure the levels of anger among the locals wasn’t helped by an incredibly insensitive RBS advert in this morning’s Herald, with the slogan it’s our job to respond to our customers’ changing lives”.\nThe truth is, rather than responding to their customers’ changing lives, it’s the RBS who are imposing change on their customers’ lives.\nAs the motion I put down in Parliament says, this decision sends out all the wrong messages and undermines the work that has been and is being done by so many to help with the economic regeneration of Argyll & Bute.\nAnd I repeat the call I made for the majority state-owned RBS to better recognise its social responsibility and stop this brutal closure programme.”\nBrendan O’Hara MP will be visiting Rothesay on Monday 18th December and Campbeltown on Friday 22nd December 2017 to launch petitions against the RBS decision to close its branches in those towns.\nAdditional information:\nThe text of the petition reads as follows:\n“To the House of Commons,\nThe petition of residents of ARGYLL & BUTE\nDeclares that proposed closure of the Inveraray, Campbeltown and Rothesay branches of the publicly-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will have a detrimental effect on local communities and the local economy.\nThe petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges Her Majesty’s Treasury, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Royal Bank of Scotland to take into account the concerns of petitioners and take whatever steps they can to halt the planned closure of these branches.”",

The time for listening is over; now is the time to act.\nHe went on to say,\n“Any movement to mitigate the worst of the problems of Universal Credit roll out is welcome, but I fear that despite a change in face, it will be more of the same as we have just seen this week in the House of Commons when Ms Rudd refused to accept the United Nations damning conclusion that poverty is the political choice of this Tory government”.",

With many countries going into lock down, airlines are either cancelling flights or hiking prices for remaining seats. Some people are also facing the real possibility of running out of money and having nowhere to stay.\nIt is very worrying to hear that they seem to be getting little help from British consular services overseas. I have been in touch with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ask for their support and will continue to do what I can to make sure everyone is able to come home safely.\nHowever, as this situation with a lack of information seems to be widespread, the SNP has now urged the FCO to set out updated guidance and practical support for UK citizens stranded overseas due to the coronavirus crisis.\nDespite the FCO earlier issuing guidance calling on UK nationals to return to the UK now if they are travelling abroad, many people are stuck due to countries going into lock down, airlines hiking prices for remaining commercial flights, and people being pushed into financial difficulties and facing hurdles accessing key services and advice.\nLeading for the SNP in an Urgent Question in Westminster yesterday, my SNP Westminster colleague, Shadow Transport spokesperson Gavin Newlands MP said:\n“The UK government has taken positive steps to help UK nationals stranded overseas, however there are still many cases of constituents left without support and information that they so desperately need.\n“With only a limited number of commercial routes home – many at extortionate rates – and more and more countries imposing stricter measures to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the FCO must urgently outline what support is being offered to UK citizens stuck abroad.\n“Many MPs are receiving concerning cases of constituents who have no means of getting home, have health issues and need access to care, will be facing financial strain due to costs, and have had issues accessing consular advice in relevant countries.\n“The reality on the ground is difficult and ever-changing – I urge the FCO to do absolutely everything in its power to repatriate UK citizens, and set out what practical and financial resources are currently being made available to those stranded UK nationals, and working effectively with UK embassies to assist citizens accessing accommodation and healthcare that they may need.”\nIf anyone has concerns about loved ones who are abroad and trying to get home please contact me on brendan.ohara.mp@parliament.uk.",

The event was a huge success, meeting valued constituents who would otherwise never have had the opportunity to meet with their MP. This was the first of what is hoped to be a new grassroots approach to interacting with the many communities around Argyll and Bute.\n“This was a great success, so many locals came over to say hello, tell me what mattered to them and speak to me about issues which affect their lives. Many more have followed up with me on more complex or private matters which they would otherwise never have thought to approach their MP about. One of the best bits about this job is meeting such a huge variety of so many people, and if I can help with an issue, big or small, it’s what I’m here for.\nThis was a great start to this initiative and I am already arranging with other retailers to do the same as often as possible and as widely as I can.

Brendan has held constituency surgeries from Campbeltown to Tiree and all points in-between. Along with visits to schools and clubs, our new MP has met with almost 100 local organisations who are working to improve the lives of people in their communities.\n• map of Argyll and Bute constituency showing all visited places\nCommenting on his first audit, Brendan said:\n“Back in May last year I said I’d be a representative of every part of this constituency and wouldn’t concentrate my efforts in the larger towns. I vowed to get around as many parts of Argyll & Bute as I possibly could and visit every island community. I am delighted that the audit of my first year’s work shows I have done exactly that.\nGetting around this vast, diverse constituency is as real challenge and the mileage I’ve clocked up is quite incredible but that comes with the job and the distances I have to cover are more than compensated for by the communities I have met and the incredible beauty on offer. I still find it hard to believe that we have a coast line longer than France, we have 20 harbours, no fewer 6 airports and we even a very real opportunity to house the first ever UK spaceport in Machrihanish.\nWe have so much to offer here in Argyll & Bute and part of my job is to promote this constituency as a tourist destination, a centre of marine and renewable technology, the home of Scotch Whisky and a wonderful place to come and live and raise a family. With a population of just under 90,000 people, we have plenty of room for people to come to Argyll & Bute.\nIt has been an honour and a privilege to meet the people of this constituency and engage with the many hard working local organisations who are providing vital services to those in need and I will continue to support them in any way I can”.\nBrendan, who currently shares an office in Dunoon with Michael Russell MSP has just opened the first ever parliamentary office in Helensburgh and is hopeful of opening another office in Oban. “It is vital that local representatives are accessible and that people know where their MP is and how to contact them.

On average, 12 months after the rollout of Universal Credit, foodbanks see a 52% increase in demand.\nCommenting, Mr O’Hara said, “While the Work and Pensions Secretary, Esther McVey continues to defend Universal Credit, we are witnessing the real impact this benefit is having on our local communities across Scotland.”\n“These appalling figures bring into sharp focus, the damning indictment of the UK government cuts to welfare, and the botched rollout of Universal Credit.”\n“As these figures show, the five week delay in getting a first payment is pushing people into crisis, and this is just one example of why the roll out of Universal Credit must be halted immediately, so that fundamental flaws can be addressed.”\n“Despite overwhelming evidence of the devastating impact this benefit is having on people across Scotland, Esther McVey and her government are hell bent on pursing their flag-ship Universal Credit project. It is frankly insulting and shows just how out-of-touch the UK Government is.”\nThe Trussell Trust Figures come as the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights is visiting Scotland this week to investigate the impact of austerity and the link between poverty and the realisation of human rights.\nhttps://www.trusselltrust.org/2018/11/06/action-still-needed-universal-credit-wait/",

I know that you will welcome this, but it is important to understand fully what the small changes to the lockdown rules are and for each of us to continue to follow those rules.\nThroughout phase one, it remains vital to respect the guidance, to continue respecting the personal space of other people, and to keep in mind that things are not back to normal and that things should not feel like normal.\nA full note on the Scottish Government guidance can be accessed on the Scottish Government website. Below is a summary of today’s announcement.\nAlthough we have started on the path out of lockdown it is important that you continue to stay at home as much as possible. Lockdown has been modified slightly, but it is by no means over. This virus hasn’t gone away and we must all take care to protect ourselves and our families.\nRemember that social distancing must remain. Stay at least 2 metres away from people outside your household, continue to wash your hands regularly, and wear a face covering in shops and on public transport.\nWe are only able to take these small steps forward now because of your adherence to the rules. I do not underestimate the personal sacrifices you are making through lockdown and thank you for your efforts. If we all continue to stick to the rules, then hopefully we can look forward to moving towards phase two sooner rather than later.\nFrom today (Thursday 28th May)\nTest and Protect is now in place across Scotland. This is Scotland’s way of putting into practice the ‘test, trace, isolate, support’ strategy. If you start showing any symptoms of coronavirus—that is a high temperature or fever, a new continuous cough, or a loss of, or change in sense of smell or taste— then you should visit the NHS Inform website to book a test immediately.\nFrom tomorrow (Friday 29th May)\nBusiness and public services\n- Most outdoor work can resume.\n- The construction industry can begin site preparation.\n- Garden centres and plant nurseries can reopen some of their services.\n- Drive through food outlets are no longer being discouraged to remain closed.\n- Non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants & cafes—except for takeaway—must remain closed.\n- Household waste recycling centres can reopen from Monday. Exact arrangements for Argyll and Bute will be confirmed by the Council. Do not travel to a centre before checking https://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/coronavirus-help-and-advice\n- Other business premises should remain closed unless they are providing essential goods and services.\n- All businesses should continue to allow staff to work from home wherever possible.\nSport and recreation\n- Some non-contact outdoor leisure activity will be allowed to restart, for example golf, tennis, bowls, and fishing.\n- You can sit and sunbathe in parks & open areas.\n- You can travel—preferably active travel such as cycling or walking—to a location near your local community for leisure & recreation. This should be no more than 5 miles from your home. You should stay within or close to local area and not use public transport unless absolutely necessary.\nSocial interaction\n- You can meet with another household outdoors, for example in a park or a private garden. You should not be meeting multiple households at the same time and this should only be in small groups, the total number of people being no more than eight.\n- You don’t have to pick just only one household to meet with during phase one, but you can only meet with one other household at a time and the strong advice is to limit this to one other household per day.\n- You should continue to stay at least 2 metres away from others who are not members of your household and avoid touching the same hard surfaces. For example, if meeting for a barbecue, each household should have its own cutlery, plates, etc.\n- If visiting another household it is vital that you don’t go indoors. Think practically—don’t visit another house if you think there’s a risk of you needing to enter their house to use their toilet for instance.\n- Do not hug or touch people who are not part of your household. This is really difficult, but it is really crucial that social distancing remains in place at this time. Full guidance on this distancing is available on the Scottish Government’s website.\nFrom Monday 1st June\nEducation and childcare\n- Teachers and staff will be able to enter schools to prepare for the reopening of schools in August.\nFrom Wednesday 3rd June\nEducation and childcare\n- Childcare will be available for larger numbers of children who most require it, for example vulnerable children and children of essential workers.\n- Childminding services and fully outdoor nursery provision can take place, but there continues to be limits on the number of children which can be cared for.\nOther changes during phase one\n- Some key public services such as some respite care, children hearings and some key heath programmes will restart work.",

And I wish it every success.”\nHe continued;\n“I know that the Sinjar and Snuni hospitals are enduring a chronic shortage of medicines and even the most basic of painkillers are in desperately short supply. Anything therefore that we can send will be gratefully received by the doctors and nurses”\nCommenting on his own association with the Yazidi people, the local MP said; “I have been involved in highlighting the plight of the Yazidi people since first being contacted by my constituent, Fiona Bennett shortly after being elected in 2015. The story she told me was so shocking that it would have been impossible for me not to try and help in whatever way I could.”\nSince then, Mr O’Hara has raised the fate of the Yazidi community on numerous occasions in parliament and last year hosted Nadia Murad, the former Daesh sex-slave at Westminster and was the only UK parliamentarian to be invited to join her in New York when she was made a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking in 2016.\nHe added;\n“When Fiona contacted me again with the idea of collecting medicines to send out to Sinjar, I agreed, without hesitation. This is yet another wonderful example of her humanitarianism and it shows the power that just one committed and motivated individual can make.”\nMr. O’Hara concluded;\n“Whether it’s by funding Mary Meals or the tremendous work being done by local groups in Malawi, or with the welcome shown to the Syrian families on Bute, the people of Argyll & Bute have a long and proud record of helping those less fortunate than ourselves, and I’m sure they’ll rise again to the challenge of finding basic medicines to help the appallingly mistreated and impoverished Yazidi community”",

(Thursday 29 March). The petition which was launched by Mr O’Hara back in December last year, as soon as RBS announced their closure list, has gathered the signatures of several hundred local people.\nMr O’Hara said, “As I promised to do, I presented a petition on behalf of the people of Inveraray. Ten years ago the people of this community along with other UK taxpayers bailed out RBS to the tune of £50 billon and now without any consultation, they have decided that this branch may close. We know that a stay of execution has been given but threat of closure is still very real. The people of this town are rightly outraged at this decision leaving them with no bank at all and the several hundred people who signed the petition only serves to show the strength of feeling. My thanks to everyone of who took the time to sign it and my thanks to Marion Pallister and Donald Clark of the George Hotel who have been heavily involved in the campaign. Be assured that I will continue to work with the community to make the case for this bank to remain open for business. We are not giving up.”\nNote to Editor:\nA link to Mr O’Hara presenting the petition can be found at https://bit.ly/2pNJI0K\nThe petition reads:\n‘Declares that proposed closure of the Inveraray branch of the publicly-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will have a detrimental effect on local and surrounding communities and the local economy. The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges Her Majesty’s Treasury, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Royal Bank of Scotland to take in account the concerns of petitioners and take whatever steps they can to halt the planned closure of this branch.",

Thousands of tonnes of falling debris – including boulders the size of Transit Vans – forced the closure of the A83 after 100mm of rain fell in just a few hours last Tuesday night, causing the worst landslide in living memory.\nSince then, traffic has been diverted via the Old Military Road and while not ideal, it is working and Argyll remains open for business.\nSpeaking after a site meeting on the hill with Kevin Campbell, Senior Operations Manager at BEAR Scotland and local SNP councillor Iain Shonny Paterson, the local MP said: “This is the second major landslip this year that has resulted in the road being closed. With everything the economy of area has been through in 2020, this was the last thing our hospitality and tourism sector needed.”\nOur ambition for the future should not be limited by what we have done in the past.”\nBrendan O’Hara MP\n“I appreciate the heroic efforts of the BEAR Scotland workforce in building the mitigation pits and in clearing debris from the road, these are massive tasks but we cannot go on second guessing this hillside; one which will become increasingly unstable due to climate change and increased rainfall.”\nMr. O’Hara also warmly welcomed the statement made by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in parliament last week when she said of the Rest and be Thankful; “This is the utmost priority on the part of government and clearly there is a lot of work to be done on developing that solution”.\nA long-time advocate of a tunnel as a permanent answer to the problems of the A83, Mr. O’Hara, who recently joined engineers constructing undersea tunnels in the Faroe Island said that he hoped that the construction of a tunnel would be given “serious consideration” by those charged with finding the answer.\nHe said: “I have seen these tunnels from construction to completion; they work and have proven to be value for money in the long term. If the rest of northern Europe can build tunnels to connect their rural communities and their islands, there is absolutely no reason why Scotland cannot. Our ambition for the future should not be limited by what we have done in the past.”",

As well as bringing fibre to some new areas, the extended build will also boost speeds for some places, which do not yet have superfast.\nTwo new exchange areas in Argyll and Bute, Kilchenzie and Kilninver, previously not reached within the budget, are expected to see some coverage and around 80 existing projects across the Highlands and Islands will see extended coverage and more local infrastructure to improve speeds.\nThe Scottish Government has committed to bringing superfast broadband access to all premises by 2021, and a procurement to deliver the Roaching 100% (R100) project is currently under way.\nCommenting, Argyll and Bute MP, Brendan O’Hara said:\n“This is excellent news for Argyll and Bute and I am delighted to hear that the DSSB project has passed its original targets and is providing opportunities for businesses and communities across the constituency.”\n“When launched in 2014, this project was one of the most challenging broadband projects in Europe, due to the geography of rural Scotland, the scattered nature of the population and the lack of existing or planned fibre infrastructure.”\n“It has been a huge engineering challenge and there’s still some way to go, however we will build on this success and the R100 programme, backed with £600 million, will deliver superfast broadband access to every home and business in Scotland by the end of 2021 – the only part of the UK to do so.”",

The support is designed to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability.\nTory MP and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit George Freeman, said the changes would ensure that benefits went to people who are “really disabled” rather than people “who suffer from anxiety”.

We are not getting the full story from the UK Government and this is a real cause for concern.\n‘’In my letter I ask for clarification on a number of issues including whether or not the spending announced so far is the minimum necessary to ensure the continuance of the programme: whether other potential investments, such as a state-of-the-art ‘frigate factory’ described to me as a ‘game changer’ have been shelved, and why some £750 million in promised spending has failed to materialise.\n‘’The Defence Secretary has to understand that the workforce – their families and the communities at the yards at Scotstoun and Govan have been promised so much over the years but much of it remains to be delivered. They have previously experienced a painful restructuring, and have felt that they have held up their end of the bargain.\n‘’Mr Fallon has to agree that the least they can expect in return is for these promises to be upheld – and upheld in full and on time.’’\nTEXT OF LETTER TO MICHAEL FALLON HERE :\nYou will no doubt be aware of the evidence that was presented to the Defence Select Committee on June 7th by a number of highly credible witnesses, including Lord West, Peter Roberts from the Royal United Services Institute and the Trades Unions representing the workers at BAE on the Clyde.\nThese witnesses were united in the opinion that because of pressures on the MoD budget, the ‘cutting steel’ for the Type 26 frigate programme was going to be considerably delayed: while there was no consensus on when that would be, it was worrying to note that one witness expressed his opinion that 2019 was most likely.\nCan I urge you today to use your office to assuage the fears of the work force by confirming that there will be no slippage in the timetable agreed, so that cutting steel on the Type 26 programme will begin as soon as possible; that the vessels will be built in full on the Clyde; and that and that the Terms of Business Agreement between the MoD and BAE will be fully adhered to?\nFrom the evidence the Committee heard today, and in other discussions I have had with the Unions at the Yards, I understand that the spending announced so far to date is the minimum necessary to ensure the continuance of the programme: other potential investments, such as a state-of-the-art ‘frigate factory’ described to me as a ‘game changer’ have been shelved, as some £750 million in promised spending has failed to materialise.\nAs you know, the promise of thirteen Type 26 frigates made in 2014 was broken almost immediately when the number of Type 26’s was reduced to just eight in last year’s SDSR.\nAt the time, the workforce were confident that any shortfall in this work would be made up by the General Purpose Frigate programme that the Prime Minister announced that same day.\nWhat assurance can you give the Clyde workforce that their yards will continue to be the United Kingdom’s centre of excellence for building complex warships, and that these General Purpose Frigates will be built there?\nThe workforce at the yards at Scotstoun and Govan have been promised so much over the years but much of it remains to be delivered.

Women who have worked all of their lives and sensibly planned for their retirement to maintain their independence, now find themselves facing great financial hardship through no fault of their own. These women had been told that they would be entitled to their pension at the age of 60 but instead get hit twice – first when its raised to 65 in line with men and then again when its increased for men and women to the age of 66. Successive governments have failed in their obligation to give ample notice to women affected by this – some have had as little as 2 years and many have received no notice at all – this is unacceptable.”\nBrendan, went on to say,\n“If there are any women out there in Argyll and Bute who are affected by this, I would urge them to contact me. WASPI women are working closely with a number of MPs from all political persuasions, of which I am one, to urge the government to think again.

Analysis has revealed that the number of EU nurses applying to work in the UK has already fallen by a staggering 87% and over 7,000 nurses and midwives from the EEA have left the UK since the EU referendum – and this is all before we have even left the EU.\n“As we head into today’s Queen’s Speech, I am urging the Tory government to heed the evidence and warnings from third sector organisations and to commit to an independent impact assessment – also consulting the devolved governments and health administrations – on the consequences of Brexit on the industry.\n“There is a crisis looming and the UK government’s lack of action is deeply concerning – it will be those that rely on the service and need it most and those that deliver it that will be paying the price.\n“With Boris Johnson intent on pursuing his extreme Brexit plans, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the threat to our economy, jobs and people’s livelihoods is growing and that the only way to properly protect our interests is through independence.”\nENDS\nNotes for editors:\nThe Private Members Bill was first introduced last November, and had it passed it would have required the UK government to carry out an impact assessment on the effects leaving the EU would have on health and social care services.\nEU nurses give up on Brexit Britain as their prospects dim: https://www.ft.com/content/8f2d6e22-e7f9-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3https://snp.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4fae14f57a18ee08253ffc251&id=8ff3ad7bee&e=bdc3fb23f2",

These cuts affect each and every one of us.\n“There is no doubt this Tory government is making Scotland worse off and after Brexit, even if the UK signs a free trade agreement with the EU, this will mean Scotland’s GDP will be 6.1%, or £1,610 per person, lower by 2030.\n“Instead of halting Universal Credit – the Chancellor has only applied a sticking plaster to a system that is failing the weakest and the most vulnerable in our society.\n“This Chancellor has failed to introduce a real Living wage, failed to lift the benefits freeze, failed to scrap the two-child cap, failed to abolish the bedroom tax, failed to halt Universal Credit and failed to give fairness to the thousands of WASPI women across Argyll and Bute who have lost their pensions.\n“Worse still, with the UK Government’s failure to match fund the Tayside deal, undercutting the Scottish Government pledge by £50bn, I’m now seriously concerned about the prospects for Argyll and Bute’s rural growth deal.",

I know officials will have been working hard in extremely difficult circumstances to help, but this is a leadership problem that goes right to the top. Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, must explain why thousands of emails detailing desperate pleas for help, have been directed into a black hole.\nMr O’Hara, who is also SNP spokesperson on International Human Rights, went on to say, “We always knew it was a long-shot, but we told those who contacted us that we’d do our best, which we did. To find out now that in all likelihood, those emails containing the names and details weren’t even looked at is a real kick in the teeth and must be absolutely heart-breaking for those who’d been living in hope of a minor miracle. If this report is correct, government figures for those still requiring evacuation is far in excess of the 1,100 quoted. The UK evacuation finished yesterday, and it looks like these people have simply been abandoned to their fate.”\nThis government should hang their heads in shame at this moral, political and humanitarian tragedy that could have been avoided.\nActor and Spirit Aid founder, David Hayman\nDavid Hayman set up the Scottish humanitarian relief organisation Spirit Aid in a bid to alleviate the suffering of children and young people affected by poverty, neglect, abuse, lack of opportunity, humanitarian crisis and war. It operates projects in Scotland and overseas including Afghanistan, Palestine and South Africa.\nHe explained that since 2002, Spirit Aid has been providing medical services to isolated communities, refugee camps, prisons and women’s groups in the mountains of Northern Afghanistan.\nHe said: “Afghanistan is the poorest country in the world outside of Africa. Two out of every five children are dead by the age of five. Maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the world. The country has been devastated by war, poverty and drought. We have seven members of our staff – teachers, doctors and our pharmacist – desperate and in fear of their lives having just been abandoned by the UK; this government should hang their heads in shame at this moral, political and humanitarian tragedy that could have been avoided.”",

On Mr O’Hara’s advice they managed to get the signatures of 1100 Helensburgh school children for their petition which they plan to present to Parliament.\nMr O’Hara said,\n“I met with this remarkable group of young people who are rightly outraged at the plight of refugee children who, on fleeing their war torn country are unable to be reunited with their loved ones because of this UK government’s laws. My advice to them was to speak to as many people as possible about it to inform and change peoples’ attitudes. I am absolutely delighted to hear they have over a thousand signatures from Helensburgh school children equally appalled at what is happening”.\nHe went onto say,\n“We often hear of how young people are not engaged in politics and it is why I took the opportunity in parliament to pay tribute to them and asked my MP colleague Angus MacNeil who brought the Bill to parliament, to join me in welcoming them when they visit the House to present their petition. They are truly an inspiration to young people in Scotland who are making sure that their voices are heard loud and clear. I am very proud of each and everyone of them.”\nPolicy Lead for Education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly added,\n“It’s important that our young people know how to make the changes they want to see in the world. We fully support this work and congratulate Hermitage Academy pupils for taking positive action on a cause that matters to them and is all about helping others.”\nThe school’s Rights Respecting Group haven’t stopped there and plan to do a bag pack at a local supermarket to raise money for them to travel to Parliament to present their petition and are having a Bake for Syria week next month to raise funds which will go towards improving the education for refugee children.\nThe Private Members’ Bill, after several hours of debate, was voted to proceed to the Committee stage of the process by an 87 majority.",

This was reflected in the report’s findings that over 85% of respondents were either ‘very unhappy’ or ‘somewhat unhappy’ with the UK Government’s response.\n“In total 30 constituents and their families contacted me asking for help from the FCO. These people were left stranded across the globe including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Peru, Nepal and Egypt and sadly, in one case, the results of this were catastrophic.\nBrendan O’Hara MP\nCommenting, Argyll & Bute MP Brendan O’Hara said:\n“As soon the scale of the impact of the virus became clear, SNP MPs lobbied the UK Government to follow our neighbours – like Germany and the Netherlands – and actively organise flights to repatriate UK citizens trapped abroad.\n“In total 30 constituents and their families contacted me asking for help from the FCO. These people were left stranded across the globe including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Peru, Nepal and Egypt and sadly, in one case, the results of this were catastrophic. Everyone who contacted me was shocked that the FCO would effectively abandon its citizens abroad while they watched the governments of other countries act swiftly to get their citizens home.\n“Complaints were made to me about the lack of information available from embassies especially for elderly and vulnerable constituents who were having to camp out in airports in the hope of getting a flight. When they did eventually act, the high cost of repatriation flights proved prohibitive to those who had already spent weeks and months booking and re-booking flights in the hope of getting home and using up all income they had in doing so.”\n“The lack of action in response shows the UK Government in a position it seems to be repeatedly found in these days: asleep at the wheel. There was an absence of leadership and direction from the very top of this rudderless Tory Government which impacted my constituents when they most needed help.”\nMr O’Hara added: “Despite the herculean efforts of individual Foreign Office staff around the world, it is painfully clear to anyone watching that years of sustained funding cuts have left the UK Government unable to fulfil its basic obligations to its citizens. The pandemic has shown this to be as true abroad as it is at home.”",

SAMS is a world leading research centre based in the constituency that studies our seas and oceans and undertakes research on how we can better protect our biosphere. SAMS works not only to educate society on the marine system, but also informs policymakers and businesses on the importance and benefits of improving practices relating to the sea.\nI initially met with Professor Alex Miller, Deputy director of SAMS, who showed me some of the amazing work that the organisation have been doing recently. I was then introduced to Sessi (pictured above) who showed me some of their own research. SAMS not only provide excellent insight into marine science, they are also excellent at working with local schools and promoting the benefit of undertaking undergraduate studies in things like marine science.\nI then visited Dunollie Castle which is located just a short walk from the centre of Oban.\nI was shown around the Castle and Museum by General Manager, Emma Sutcliffe and Heritage Engagement Officer, Jamie MacGregor. Dunollie has been home to Clan MacDougall for over 900 years and is just one of many thoroughly interesting heritage sites in and around the coastline of Argyll.\nDunollie Castle reopens for the season at the beginning of April and I’d encourage anybody that has not yet done so to make a day of visiting this very interesting place.

All of the men have consistently protested their innocence and have presented documentary evidence supporting this.\nSpeaking outside Number 10 alongside his parliamentary colleague Kirsten Oswald MP (East Renfrewshire) and Yvonne McHugh, Billy’s fiancé, Brendan said “Billy has been the victim of a travesty of justice. He and his shipmates were going about their business of protecting shipping, legally and peacefully. That they now\nface 5 years in jail for a crime that didn’t happen is absolutely unbelievable and our government must make their case an urgent priority”\nAddressing Yvonne and the families, Brendan also said; “What you have done to keep these men at the forefront of people’s minds has been remarkable. You have petitioned, you have lobbied, you have\ndemonstrated. No one could have better advocates for their cause than you.”\nExamining the role of politicians, Brendan continued “I know there is widespread cross-party support in parliament for these men; I recently helped set-up the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Chennai 6 and I will continue to do what I can as an individual MP. But there only so much we can do, particularly as the advice we received from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was always “not to rock the boat”, as diplomatic channels were the best way to proceed. I’m afraid the time has come to “rock the boat” and we\nparliamentarians must now put pressure the UK government to use whatever influence it has with the Indian authorities to see that these men receive justice.”\nBrendan concluded: “This is a time of great uncertainty and flux in UK politics, so we must ensure the plight of these men is not forgotten and their case remains a key priority. I continue my pledge to do everything I can to keep the pressure on and ensure the UK government is taking ‘real’ steps to secure their release.”",

The MoD then asked for savings of £500m to be made over five years, refusing the offer of BAE Systems to save £275m and still begin work on time. The delays have put jobs at risk, and the leaked emails suggest that the delays in building work will end up costing the taxpayer more money in the long-term, which has been echoed by Former First Sea Lord Admiral Lord West.\nCommenting, SNP MSP Bill Kidd said:\n“These delays show the Tory Government’s ideological obsession with making cuts, no matter the cost. By going back on the original deal and rejecting the offer of BAE Systems to make savings whilst still beginning work on time, the Tories have confirmed that they are prepared to put jobs at risk and waste taxpayers’ money in pursuing cuts across all sectors of government.\n“The Tory Government told us during the independence referendum that jobs in shipbuilding would be safe if Scotland voted No. If the very clear promises made to workers on the Clyde by the UK Government before the referendum were to be broken, it would be an unforgivable betrayal to the workforce – and people in Glasgow and across Scotland would not be quick to forget.\n“What makes this even more remarkable is that the Tories continue to be willing to spend over £200bn replacing the outdated and completely redundant Trident nuclear weapons system. The country needs a defence system capable of tackling the many modern threats that we face, not one geared towards Cold War politics.\n“The ongoing turmoil and uncertainty within the Tory party is no excuse for these delays and cuts. It’s about time the UK Government did the decent thing and kept the very clear promises they made to the workers during the referendum – and delivered the contract for the frigates without further delay.”\nThe story is reported on Page 4 of the Scottish Sun",

We want that money to go straight into their hands. That’s a decision the SNP Government has already made – as was announced yesterday. It is not for a Tory Chancellor to dictate terms on money that is owed to Scotland.”\n“This is the thin end of the wedge, and all parties at Holyrood should stand firmly against such unacceptable attempts to erode the powers of our parliament “\n“But the bigger issue is this – the Tories think they can tear up the Scotland Act with impunity and undo twenty years of devolution in a single stroke.

During the afternoon experts from Waverley Care provided information on sexual health while representatives from Equality Network Scotland & LEAP Sports Scotland were able to discuss diversity, equality, rights and political issues as well as provide information on inclusive activities and sports.\nIt was good to catch up with so many people including Alan Izat from Bute LGBT+ Community Group and Pride organisation, as well as Oceana Maund from Equality Network and Tommy and Bill from Leap Sports. Well done also to raffle ticket hostess Catherine Gillies for all her hard work and to the whole team for managing to raise £152 which will be used to support the third annual Bute PRIDE event which this year will, hopefully, take place in Guilford Square on September 4.\nIt was great to see so many fantastic raffle prizes including a voucher from Bute Paddle Boards and I hope the person who wins the bottle of House of Commons whisky enjoys it when the raffle is drawn next Saturday!\nBUTE LGBT+ is dedicated to promoting LGBT+ diversity, identity, support and education on the Isle of Bute and Promoting Pride Event.

It has been transformational to the town of Helensburgh and we can already see that in the way in which people are engaging with the square. It has very quickly become the town’s showpiece and the people of Helensburgh are rightly very proud of their new civic space. I’m am certain that it will become a magnet which will draw people into the town and that we will be reaping the benefits of this investment for many years to come.”\nThe Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) is the professional body for all chartered architects in Scotland and is the foremost architectural institute in the country dealing with architecture and the built environment.\n(END)",

The mast went live in December 2020, providing vital 4G connectivity to both residents and visitors to the area through the mobile network operator EE. Simultaneously, the mast will be used by EE to provide coverage in connection with its Emergency Services Network requirements in the location. Significantly, the mast has also enabled 999 calls to be made in those “notspot” areas where connectivity was lacking.”\nThe SNP MP added: “This represents a vital part of the Scottish Government’s wider portfolio of digital connectivity programmes, which includes the Reaching 100% Programme, which is delivering access to superfast broadband to all remaining hard-to-reach addresses throughout the country. This programme is crucial to Scotland’s future economic success.\n“However, I know there is still much to be done and over the last few months I have been pressing the UK Government to commit to a timetable for connecting infrastructure it already has in place for the new Emergency Services Network. It is not clear why the Home Office has delayed completion of these facilities – which include ten sites in rural areas of this constituency -and I will continue to press them to do more to get the masts active so mobile network operators are able to offer better mobile coverage to many more people across this area.”",

Land reform legislation offers communities the opportunity to turn around decades of economic and social decline. The impact of self-determination on a community should not be understated. The very existence of the Scottish Land Fund sends a message that there is confidence in what we are trying to achieve. “\nColin Morrison , Chair of North West Chair Mull Community Woodland added,\n‘We all enjoyed the opportunity to bring the story of Ulva into the heart of Westminster. Those present were genuinely interested in the Right to Buy process and seemed impressed with our ambitious plans for housing, sustainable development, regeneration and environmental protection. The Ulva team would like to thank Brendan for arranging the event’\nBrendan commented,\n“I was absolutely delighted to host this reception in Westminster and I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to the NWMWC for seeing the sale through to its conclusion with the support of the Scottish Government and the Macquarie Group whose donation took the fundraising of the community over the line.

The Ombudsman said the DWP’s failures amounted to “maladministration”.\nPHSO Chief Executive Amanda Amroliwala also said their investigation found the DWP, “failed to act quickly enough once it knew a significant proportion of women were not aware of the changes to their State Pension age”, and that it “should have written to the women affected at least 28 months earlier than it did”.\nIn a letter to the Secretary of State for DWP, Therese Coffrey, Brendan O’Hara MP said: “These failings have had a huge impact on the lives of so many women in my constituency, bringing untold worry and stress for them and their families over their financial future. It is therefore vital that you and your department address the findings outlined in the PHSO’s report to ensure justice is secured for all the women impacted by these changes.”\nThe local MP is a staunch supporter of the UK-wide WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign and the Argyll & Isles group, meeting members and raising the subject in the House of Commons on numerous occasions.\nBrendan O’Hara added: “The SNP have worked towards securing fairness for the women impacted by the changes to the State Pension age and have continually advocated on their behalf in Westminster. The women – and men – involved in the WASPI campaign, including the Argyll & Isles group, have worked so hard to keep this issue in the spotlight and have this inequality rectified and rightly so. My SNP colleague and I will continue to support the WASPI campaign as we wait for the next stage of the Ombudsman report to be published.”\nArgyll & Isles WASPI organiser Ann Greer said: “1950s born women in Argyll & Bute, have been campaigning about State Pension age changes since 2015; some of us met with Brendan at the first Women Against State Pension Inequality demonstration at Westminster in 2016 and others at the even bigger one in 2017 and have appreciate his continued support.\n“WASPI Argyll and Isles group have had cross-party support in Argyll & Bute Council – a member from Kintyre and I spoke at a council meeting in 2016, where the WASPI Motion was unanimously passed by councillors.\nShe added: “We are part of UK wide (plus International group) Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign. It is time for the UK Government to stop conflating our Ask as if we are campaigning for women’s SPa to be returned to 60. We are not. DWP’s response to Ombudsman’s first report did likewise; WASPI is not opposed to SPa equalisation-men and women have retired at the same age, for some time now. Our issue is with the way this was done-PHSO has now proven that maladministration has occurred. “\n“We await the next stages in the PHSO’s investigation and hope that they advise the UK Government to ‘put things right’.”",

Data from Target Ovarian Cancer, which provides the secretariat for the APPG, shows just one in five women can name bloating as one of the key symptoms of the disease. The symptoms of ovarian cancer are:\n• Persistent bloating- not bloating that comes and goes\n• Feeling full or loss of appetite\n• Tummy pain\n• Needing to wee more often or more urgently\nBrendan O’Hara MP said: Too many women die of ovarian cancer. We all have to act to ensure that more women know the symptoms to look out for, are diagnosed sooner and get the treatment they need. That’s why I was delighted to take part in this year’s Teal Hero event to support women with ovarian cancer and their families.\nSharon Hodgson MP, Chair of the APPG on Ovarian Cancer, said: “I’m proud to become a Teal Hero today to raise awareness of ovarian cancer and help more women get an early diagnosis.

We all know that much more needs to be done to see the improvements in diagnosis and survival that women with ovarian cancer and their families deserve.\nWe look forward to working with these MPs to transform the futures of women with ovarian cancer.”\nOvarian cancer can be devastating. Every year 7,300 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK, and 4,100 women die from the disease.

It is unlikely that your symptoms are caused by a serious problem, but it is important to be checked out.\nTarget Ovarian Cancer is asking all editors not to use the term ‘silent killer’, as it merely reinforces perceptions that the symptoms of ovarian cancer can’t be spotted until later stages.

In Argyll & Bute the charity responded to nearly 23,000 incidents involving animals and 173,491 calls to its helpline from local people. In addition to this it carried out 11,120 wildlife rescues across the constituency and rehomed 1,042 animals in this area.\nEarlier this month the SSPCA’s nine animal rescue and rehoming centres became closed to the public unless by pre-arranged appointment. They also temporarily stopped accepting used blankets or towels as donations. These precautionary measures are designed to make sure their dedicated animal welfare experts can still be in centres to look after animals and receive emergencies, the animal helpline team are able to provide assistance every day and their committed inspectors and animal rescue officers can still be on-hand to rescue animals in need. The SSPCA has been monitoring the spread of the virus for some time and taken steps to ensure all of their centres were well stocked in terms of specialised food and veterinary supplies.\nIn addition, their education team have been busy developing a suite of fun, curriculum linked activities which pupils and parents can access online. This comes alongside various virtual learning initiatives to maintain engagement and help support schools and inspire young minds across Scotland. The SSPCA wants to help ensure their resources are of benefit in teaching animal welfare but also in supporting pupil development in line with the Curriculum for Excellence. These resources once available can be downloaded from here: https://www.scottishspca.org/education-resources\nIf you have any concerns about the impact of coronavirus on caring for your pet then please visit the FAQs page (https://www.scottishspca.org/coronavirus) or phone the animal helpline on 03000 999 999. There will be someone to talk to from 7am-10pm every day.\nMore information for pet owners is below:\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) – Government Advice for pet owners in self-isolation is available on the Scottish Government website.\nLivestock Owners can contact the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution on 0300 111 4166 (7am – 11pm) or visit the Royal Scottish Agriculture Benevolent Institution website.\nCurrently there is no evidence that livestock or companion animals such as dogs and cats can be infected with coronavirus.\nGuidance for beekeepers is also available on the Scottish Government website.",

This was a family in crisis, they were penniless, the father hadn’t eaten for three days and they didn’t even have enough money to buy baby milk.\n“They had been refused healthy start vouchers because they’d ticked the wrong box.\n“Isn’t this the reality of poverty created by this government?”\nMr O’Hara says this example reflects just one isolated case of a common problem across the country since Universal Credit was introduced.\nHe added: “A young family approached me for support when they found themselves in crisis, and they are not alone.\n“That crisis was a double-whammy of the void that so many people find themselves in waiting out the ‘assessment’ period of a Universal Credit claim.\n“The problem was compounded when they were told they were not entitled to Healthy Start vouchers to access baby milk which we later found out was a result of ticking the wrong box on their claim.\n“This whole system of Universal Credit should have been halted when the known problems were flagging up as the rollout continued.\n“This problem is founded on political choice and penalises our most vulnerable citizens.\n“Compare and contrast with the ‘dignity and respect’ agenda behind the Scottish social security system.\n“What happened to this young family was a direct result of UK government policy, a policy which is Dickensian, leaving some folk literally starving.\n“The levels of inequality across the town are astonishing, ranging from great personal wealth to enormous levels of poverty.”",

This clause was only narrowly defeated.\nCommenting, Brendan O’Hara said:\n“It is essential that our health and social care sectors, vital to millions of people across the UK is protected from whatever the outcome of Brexit may be. We cannot take a chance with our healthcare or the care of our most vulnerable in society”\n“This proposal was only narrowly defeated at a time when it was only just becoming apparent what the impacts of Brexit could be. A year on and we’re all far wiser”\n“We have seen stockpiling of medicines, concerns for the future of shared research, massive decreases in EU citizens choosing to live and work here and fears that the NHS could be sold from under our feet on a frenzied attempt to secure some form of free-trade deal with whichever state shouts the loudest.”\n“Our health and our social care sectors cannot be political-fodder for this obscene act of Brexit-folly.”\nSupport for the bill has attracted wide spread support across civic society; Camphill Scotland, the ALLIANCE, SCVO, Inclusion Scotland, Scottish Care are just some of the organisations throwing their support behind this Bill.\nThe Bill, having support of members from the Greens, Plaid Cymru, Liberals and Labour will call on the UK government to consult with Scottish and Welsh Ministers, the relevant Northern Ireland department, service providers, those using social and health care services and many others to ensure that their strategic planning and decisions made by government, local councils, charities, unions and other key agencies are fully informed and shaped by robust evidence.\nBrendan O’Hara added:\n“The consequences of Brexit and the implications for health and social care will be enormous in so many different ways, none more so than on our much valued but already stretched health and social care network.\n“I am determined to ensure that those making the decisions affecting these vital services do so in the full knowledge of what we are facing. We have to get this right. If we don’t the consequences will be serious and felt for many, many years to come.”\nThe Bill is scheduled for its second reading on 25th January 2019.\n– Ends –\nBriefing:\nhttps://www.camphillscotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Briefing-paper-13-November-2018-2.pdf\nParliamentary Supporters:\nBrendan O’Hara Argyll and Bute SNP (lead)\nNeil Gray Airdrie & Shotts SNP\nStephen Gethins North East Fife SNP\nJoanna Cherry Edinburgh South West SNP\nMartyn Day Linlithgow and East Falkirk SNP\nTommy Shephard Edinburgh East SNP\nCaroline Lucas Brighton Pavillion Green\nLiz Saville-Roberts Dwyfor Meirionnydd Plaid Cymru\nBen Lake Ceredigion Plaid Cymru\nChristine Jardine Edinburgh West Liberal\nLayla Moran Oxford West & Abington Liberal\nTom Brake Carshalton and Wallington Liberal\nIan Murray Edinburgh South Labour",

  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2018_09_12_boundary-commission-recommends-cuts-in-scottish-mps/content_148.html": "Argyll & Bute MP, Brendan O’Hara has pledged to vote against the Boundary Commission plan to cut Scotland’s elected representatives at Westminster from 59 to 53, should it come before Parliament.\nThe plan, released earlier this week cuts the number of Highland and Island MP from four to just three and extends the current Argyll & Bute boundary north to take in Fort William, increasing the size of an already massive constituency by almost a third.\nThe proposed new constituency of Argyll, Bute and South West Highlands will cover 9,917 km2 of the west of Scotland and will stretch from Campbeltown in the south to Fort William in the north, and from Cardross in the east to Tiree in the West. It will also include a huge number of communities of varying sizes based on 23 islands.\nCommenting Mr O’Hara said:\n“This appears to be nothing more than a crude numbers game for the Boundary Commission. In their desire to try and equalise the size of each UK constituency by population, they seem to have taken no notice of the history, geography or topography of this part of Scotland. And I am very disappointed in this proposal. The people of Argyll, Bute and South West Highlands deserve better than this.\n“The three largest constituencies (Highland North, Argyll Bute and South Highland and Highland Central) would cover a landmass of 33,282 km2 – equivalent to 42.5% of the whole of Scotland. This is equivalent to a landmass larger than Belgium.\n“But there are no plans to reduce the number of UK Government Ministers meaning elected members will have even less ability to hold them to account.\n“For an area almost half of the whole of Scotland to be represented by only 3 MPs is a democratic outrage. Especially at a time when the unelected chamber of the House of Lords continues to increase – currently numbering around 800.\n“For the mainland Highlands area, a geography one and a half times the size of Wales to be cut to just two constituencies is astonishing.\n“South of the border, the largest proposed geographic constituency is Brecon, Radnor and Mongomery in Wales, a mere 3,624km2. That’s one third of the geography of the proposed boundary of Argyll Bute and South West Highlands.\n“The UK government is in chaos as we continue to weather the unwelcome storm of Brexit. There is no appetite for these proposals. If there is a genuine desire to reduce the cost of politics at UK level, the priority must be to abolish the unelected, undemocratic House of Lords, which has zero accountability to voters.”",

I am grateful to all of my constituents who have been in touch asking me to support this campaign.\n“Miscarriage is no one’s fault yet the stigma associated can often put parents in a position where they are unable to properly grieve their loss.”\nHe added: “The UK has the opportunity with this bill to close the gap in support for families who experience miscarriage and to finally end the stigma associated with miscarriage.”",

Regardless of where they come from, we need people and that’s why any Brexit – but particularly the version in offer from the Tories – would be absolutely devastating for the future of Argyll & Bute.”\nHe added: “We cannot accept a Brexit that silences our nation, our democracy and that fails to represent the interests of people in Scotland.\n“Every single day I’m at Westminster I will continue working with anyone and everyone who is committed to stopping Brexit and all the ensuing economic damage it will do, particularly to Argyll and Bute and to Scotland.\n“All that Westminster has to offer is more chaos and confusion – potentially under the new leadership of a hard-right, extreme Tory Brexiteer.

For those who cannot afford the cost, the SNP have said it would create a new Windrush generation, of people who will be unable to secure jobs and rent properties.\nCommenting, Brendan O’Hara said:\n“The Windrush scandal has lifted the lid on the outrageous immigration policies of this Tory government, where individuals and their families are having their lives turned upside down.”\n“As Home Secretary in 2013, Theresa May remarked that the UK government should ‘deport first, and hear appeals later’ and we are now witnessing this at first hand.”\n“In Argyll and Bute, I have received a considerable number of queries from Constituents, who – out of the blue – are finding themselves classed as ‘unlawful’ citizens, despite being raised here and living their whole lives in the UK.”\n“In some circumstances, individuals are being instantly dismissed by their employers although it is blatantly and logically apparent that they are legitimate UK citizens.”\n“The SNP have long campaigned for a fair and humane immigration system. The current immigration policy of the UK Government is failing Scotland and it is vital that, in addition to UK-wide reforms, immigration powers are devolved to the Scottish Parliament to ensure that we can create a fair system for Scotland, its people and the specific needs of our economy.”",

She escaped but because of what has happened and her religion, she and her family are in hiding in fear of their lives. I asked the Minister what is being done to ‘Here Her Cries’ and help grant her asylum in the UK. I also talked about Nigerian schoolgirl Leah Sharibu, who is the only one of 1oo prisoners of Boko Haram kidnapped four years ago, who has not been released because she refused to renounce her faith.\nAs SNP spokesperson on International Human Rights I am very glad these issues are being recognised by the UK government and that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has pledged continued support to projects supporting those who are targeted, but we must also continue to put pressure on foreign governments to stop this as well.\nThis is a clip from my speech.

During the meal we talked about their past experiences as well as their future plans.”\n“Bashar talked about his son-in-law, Mohamed – a celebrated pastry chef – and showed amazing photographs of his creations. Bashar’s overwhelming desire was to be reunited with his daughter, son-in-law and his wee granddaughter and for them, one day, to open a bakery on Bute.”\n“I am absolutely delighted for Bashar, Mohamed and their family on their fantastic new business venture and I wish them every success.”\n“The recent success stories of Helmi’s Patisserie and the Orient Salon on Bute shows what a positive difference immigration makes to Scotland. It’s not about where you come from; it’s about where we’re going together and I think the recent success here in Rothesay shows just that and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the community.”",

Put crudely, the aim is to make it more difficult for people who won’t vote Conservative, to exercise their democratic rights and freedoms. It is a dark day for democracy.\nIn my speech I said: “They know full well that disproportionately, it will be the young,\nthe poor, the already marginalised and the minority communities who don’t have a passport, or who don’t drive or who haven’t managed along to register for and collect a voter ID card, that will be affected by this legislation.\n“And they know full well that already in the United Kingdom there are between two and a half and three and a half million people who do not have access to photo ID and that they will almost certainly join the nine million UK citizens who are already missing from the Electoral Register.\n“And given that it is estimated that this charade will cost in excess of £120 million to administer, I can’t help but wonder if that money wouldn’t be much better spent supporting families out of poverty – by not cutting the uplift to Universal Credit.”\nThe Bill threatens to weaken the Electoral Commission by removing its prosecutorial powers and independence, hand Ministers more power that would enable the government to decide who can or can’t participate in election campaigns and leave millions unable to vote due to proposals over voter ID requirements.\nwe can only conclude that for the party opposite, the problem isn’t that folk turn up at the polling station without photographic ID… the problem for the party opposite is that some folks turn up at the polling station at all.\nWith millions of people across the UK not holding a form of photo ID, the grim reality is that their democratic rights will not be strengthened – they will be ripped away from them.\nIt’s estimated that between 2-4% of the population do not have ID that would be suitable for voting requirements under the bill – with the UK government’s own figures putting this number at around 2.1 million.\nThe Electoral Reform Society has already warned that the Bill will lead to millions of people being ‘effectively locked out of democracy’ and could lead to voter ‘disenfranchisement on an industrial scale.\nIn contrast to this archaic Tory Government, the SNP Government in Holyrood is focused on measures to extend the franchise and encourage turnout.\nThe SNP has already introduced voting for 16 and 17-year-olds, refugees, and foreign nationals with leave to remain. The Scottish election in May this year had the highest turnout in the history of devolution.\nThe SNP has pledged it will reject any such measures related to voter ID’s for Scottish elections and referendums.\nHowever, rather than working to strengthen our democratic processes, the Tories have taken yet another page out of the Trump playbook with blatant voter suppression measures.\nThe SNP will oppose this Bill and it is vital that the UK government heeds the warnings and abandons its vote-rigging proposals immediately.\nThis is a link to my speech:",

He knows the harm ending our freedom of movement will do but he will not stand up for Argyll and Bute even though he knows the Prime Minister’s obsession will have hugely damaging consequences for Argyll and Bute”.\n“The Secretary of State, by his actions has confirmed what we have all suspected, that he is not in office to promote Scotland’s interests in the UK cabinet. Rather, he is there simply to facilitate and implement deeply damaging Tory policies in Scotland… policies that Scotland has rejected time and again.”",

I am therefore proud to join them at their demonstration in Westminster today.\n“These women had been told that they would be entitled to their pension at the age of 60 but instead get hit twice – first when its raised to 65 in line with men and then again when its increased for men and women to the age of 66. Successive governments have failed in their obligation to give ample notice to women affected by this – some have had as little as 2 years and many have received no notice at all – this is unacceptable.”\n“I hope we will soon have the equitable outcome that the WASPI women deserve.",

If the Bill were to pass its second reading, it would bring the UK one step closer to undoing this wrong.\nThe Bill calls for:\nChild refugees in the UK having the right to sponsor their close family so they can rebuild their lives together and help them integrate in their new community;\nAn expansion of who qualifies as a family so that young people who have turned 18 and elderly parents can live in safety with their families in the UK;\nThe reintroduction of legal aid so refugees can afford to navigate the complicated process of being reunited with their families.\nAhead of the debate, Mr O’Hara said:\n“Refugees should have the right to be with their family, the people they love, know them best and make them feel safe. But tragically, every single day refugee families already torn apart by conflict and war are being kept apart by restrictive UK rules. This urgently needs to change. I will be attending the Private Member’s Bill vote on 16 March and voting to bring refugee families together again.”\nKate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK, said:\n“Amnesty welcomes Mr O’Hara’s commitment to safely reuniting refugees with their families in the UK. Child refugees are some of the most vulnerable in the UK. On their arrival they face a multitude of new struggles – a new language and culture, as well as the psychological fallout from suffering incredibly traumatic experiences back in their home country. It is perverse that families are being kept apart by arbitrary rules. This is not a political issue, it is a family issue. We now hope that MPs from across the political spectrum continue to show their support and send a message to the Government that refugees in this country should be reunited with their families.”\nThe SNP MP for the Western Isles Angus MacNeil’s Private Member’s Bill is supported by Families Together, a coalition of organisations including Amnesty International, STAR Network, Refugee Council, UNHCR and the British Red Cross amongst others.",

Having committed prior to the General Election to the economic regeneration of Argyll and Bute, Brendan O’Hara is standing by pre-election initiatives which had to be postponed due to the snap election.\nPrior to the election and in his speech following the Count at Kilmory in the morning of June 9th, Brendan reaffirmed the commitment to work with all stakeholders in the promotion of Argyll and Bute. One such initiative was to engage with Argyll and Bute Council to understand better the immense work underway in the Economic Development Team, with Council Official Fergus Murray at the helm.\nBrendan and Fergus met in Oban to tour the various redevelopment projects underway in and around Oban and Connel, including the new transit berthing facility, proposed housing redevelopment and the prominent and recent aquaculture investments in the Argyll coastline.\nCommenting: Brendan O’Hara said:\n“I was delighted to see the work already well underway to reinvigorate Oban and the surrounding area. The future for what is after all a University Town is inspirational.\nArgyll and Bute is probably one of the best placed constituencies to take advantage of the boom in marine tourism, our coastline exceeding that of the whole of France. It stands to reason that our economy should take advantage of all that our marine environment has to offer.\nNot only do we have an exceptionally scenic coastline and townships but also our access to an immense natural resource that our surrounding waters can offer. The developments in and around Oban is nothing short of inspiring.\nI do feel that Argyll and Bute is on the cusp of becoming a beacon for both marine and maritime industries, whilst retaining our age-old heritage assets. What’s not to like?\nWorking in tandem with other agencies such as Highland and Island Enterprise, the future and potential for the second biggest constituency in the UK is immense.\nOban has a distinct buzz about it, things are happening and I’m really excited for the town. Of course, there are many challenges – but if we all get behind the potential of the town and have a realistic conversation about what the challenges are and how to address them, everyone stands to benefit.\nIt’s worth adding the economic regeneration team are keen to engage with all stakeholders and I would strongly urge all stakeholders to take up this offer to discuss the opportunities in and around Oban and Connell.”",

At the moment, only the companies themselves are liable for fines of up to £500,000 if they break the law.\nPatricia Gibson SNP MP led on this cause at Westminster, and introduced her Bill on nuisance calls in 2016 – the UK Government agreed then to fully adopt the recommendations proposed and legislate to make directors personally responsible for their company’s actions, should it be involved in making nuisance calls.\nBrendan O’Hara MP commented :\n‘I have regular bouts of constituents contact me about nuisance calls and often the remedy was difficult to impose.\nNuisance calls can be the bane of people’s lives so I am relieved that the full provisions of Patricia Gibson’s Nuisance Calls Bill are to be implemented by the UK Government – even if it has been a very long time coming.\nThis will mean that bosses of nuisance call operations could be fined up to £500,000.\n‘’Scores of constituents have contacted me in the past three years, explaining how nuisance calls are making their lives a misery and seeking action to prevent them. These communications can be particularly disturbing for the most vulnerable people in our communities.\n“For far too long, fines or sanctions have been easily avoided by companies dissolving and resurfacing using a new moniker. The UK government agreed that company directors would be held to account and could face personal fines of up to £500,000, should it be proven that their company acted unlawfully.\n“Today – finally the UK government have lived up to their commitment to adopt the recommendations proposed in the SNP Bill – including legislating to make company directors personally responsible – and that will hopefully end the scourge of these calls for many of us.’’",

In that time, the new Government has announced a ‘mini’ budget of a seismic scale – and which has led to uncertainty over pensions and mortgages.\nI am sure many are growing increasingly worried about the cost-of-living crisis and our household energy bills, and I have included information on what support is available to those in Argyll & Bute in my newsletter, and on what I have been doing in Parliament to support those who are going to be affected.\nI’ve also highlighted some of the things I’ve been up to in the constituency of late. Amongst others, it was great to get out to Islay and meet with many businesses and community organisations there and hear of the wonderful work they are doing. I also very much enjoyed offering my continued support to Dunoon Grammar in their bid to earn the title of ‘World’s Best School’.\nAs well as following my facebook and twitter feeds you can also keep up to date with my work on the website www.theyworkforyou.co.uk This site is also a handy resource to find out how I have voted and how other MPs may have voted as well.

Losing families will lead to the loss of schools and other vital services, which painful experience tells us that once they are gone, they are very, very difficult to bring back”.\nIn his letter, the Argyll & Bute MP told the First Minister that his opinion had been informed by extensive consultation with skippers, industry bodies, processors, and community groups over the Parliamentary Easter Recess, and what was communicated, was the overwhelming opinion of the people of Argyll & Bute.\nIn his letter, Mr. O’Hara acknowledged that the preservation of the marine ecosystem had to be a priority but believed the approach being adopted by the Scottish Government currently, was one which would inevitably lead to Argyll & Bute becoming “a retirement home for the wealthy and elderly who wish to see out their remaining years in their rural idyll”, and urged the government to engage fully with the industry and harness local knowledge – accrued over decades – on how best to manage the seas off our West Coast.\nHe closed his letter by assuring the new First Minister that from his experience in talking to the inshore fishing fleet, that there exists “a genuine willingness on their part to work together with the Scottish Government on a long term, sustainable solution, one which can help restore our marine ecosystem, while allowing the inshore fleet to look forward to a future for them, their children and their grandchildren.”\nENDS",

The cause: lack of funds. The source: the Ministry of Defence. And again, less than a year since the former Chancellor announced a £500m investment at the base.\nCommenting, local MP Brendan O’Hara:\n“I have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer citing my disappointment in this latest setback for community facilities. I have asked him to find a means of addressing this shortfall. The communities around the base deserve to see some tangible benefit from being sited so close to the UK’s nuclear deterrent programme.”\n“You could be forgiven for any scepticism about the priorities of central government funding, given the last twelve months of non-promises that have resulted in zero delivery but this latest blow for local amenities is one too far. This project is intended to be a sports facility that could have significant benefit for the local community, particularly at a time when we’re all trying to promote the benefit of an active lifestyle.

Zero account has been taken into the impact on Inveraray when the last bank in town closes. To say I’m furious is an understatement”\n“I have spoken to scores of folk around Inveraray who all depend on the RBS branch. I have delivered petitions to Parliament opposing these closures reaching literally thousands of signatures. I am astonished that Johnston Carmichael say they understand the impact of the closure of these branches. I didn’t speak to a single person who was happy about this”.\n“RBS have failed to consider their social responsibilities to rural and urban communities and to the long-lasting damage these closures will cause across Scotland and particularly in Argyll and Bute.\n“Only last week, RBS sent a leaflet to stakeholders titled “Supporting your constituency”. In that glossy little booklet, RBS refer to their 29,400 customers in Argyll and Bute. The electorate in Argyll and Bute stands at 67,230. So by RBS own admission, almost HALF of the electorate in the whole of Argyll and Bute banks with RBS. Closing 3 of the 8 branches throughout the constituency sends a seriously negative message to those of us who bank with them”.\n“RBS isn’t just another bank, almost three-quarters of it is owned by the tax-payer; folk like you and me who bailed them out at the last financial crash.”\n“RBS and the Tory Westminster Government have ignored rural communities and the Tories have failed to intervene when they knew very well it was within their power to do so”.",

We have a moral obligation to show humanity towards those in a desperate situation, and I call on the government do more than they are doing by taking more refugees into the UK.

Moved by his visit, Andrew Dismore MP proposed a bill, “to introduce a day to learn and remember the Holocaust” on 30 June 1999.\nThe Holocaust Educational Trust has been closely involved in the establishment and development of Holocaust Memorial Day since its inception in 2000. Holocaust Memorial Day is now coordinated by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.\nThe theme for the UK Holocaust Memorial Day 2017 is ‘How can life go on?’\nAbout the Holocaust Educational Trust\nThe Holocaust Educational Trust was established in 1988. Our aim is to educate young people from every background about the Holocaust and the important lessons to be learned for today. The Trust works in schools, universities and in the community to raise awareness and understanding of the Holocaust, providing teacher training, an outreach programme for schools, teaching aids and resource material. One of our earliest achievements was ensuring that the Holocaust formed part of the National Curriculum for History. We continue to play a leading role in training teachers on how best to teach the Holocaust.\nOur activities include:\nThe Outreach Programme: A central part of our work, the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Outreach Programme allows students and teachers the opportunity to hear survivor testimony firsthand and take part in focused workshops designed and delivered by our trained educators. The Programme is free of charge, and over 100,000 students a year take part.\nLessons from Auschwitz Project: The Holocaust Educational Trust’s Lessons from Auschwitz Project for post-16 students and teachers is now in its seventeenth year and has taken over 30,000 students and teachers from across the UK to the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, as part of a four-part course.\nAmbassador Programme: Following on from their involvement in the Lessons from Auschwitz Project, participants become Holocaust Educational Trust Ambassadors – people who are committed to educating others about the Holocaust and its contemporary relevance. Ambassadors can apply to become Regional Ambassadors, individuals who have all shown outstanding commitment to ensuring that the lessons of the Holocaust are not forgotten and to galvanising local communities.\nResource Development: The Holocaust Educational Trust develops engaging and interactive classroom resources, all of which are available free of charge through a dedicated section of our website. Our flagship resource, Exploring the Holocaust, is a downloadable cross-curricular teaching pack which provides teachers with all of the materials they need to teach the Holocaust across a range of subjects at Key Stage 3 (or S2 in Scotland). In 2016 we launched a new teaching guide and accompanying classroom resources for primary schools A Guide for Primary School Teachers which is designed to support the growing number of primary schools which wish to explore issues related to the Holocaust with their students. It is the first comprehensive guide of its kind and will be invaluable to teachers looking to address this subject in a sensitive and meaningful way.\nTeacher Training: As the UK’s foremost authority in Holocaust education, the Holocaust Educational Trust delivers teacher training to trainee teachers at institutions of higher education and to practising teachers as part of their Continuing Professional Development. Each year the Trust leads several UK-based seminars bringing teachers into contact with leading Holocaust scholars. Additionally, our Teacher Study Visit series gives British teachers the opportunity to learn abroad from international experts and to consider the use of historical sites to enhance students’ understanding of the Holocaust.\n– Ends –",

We all have a duty to remember the Holocaust and to stand up against antisemitism and hate, now more than ever.”\n-END-\nNotes for Editors\nAbout the Holocaust Educational Trust\nThe Holocaust Educational Trust was founded in 1988 during the passage of the War Crimes Act. Our aim is to raise awareness and understanding in schools and amongst the wider public of the Holocaust and its relevance today. We believe that the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation’s collective memory.\nOne of the Trust’s earliest achievements was to ensure that the Holocaust was included in the National Curriculum for England in 1991 – for Key Stage 3 students (11-14 year olds). The Holocaust has remained on the National Curriculum since then. We also successfully campaigned to have the assets of Holocaust victims and survivors released and returned to their rightful owners in the late 1990s.\nSince 1999 the Trust’s Lessons from Auschwitz Project has given thousands of post-16 students and teachers the opportunity to visit the Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau as part of a four-part educational programme. Since 2006 the Project has received Government funding. In 2018, the Trust received Government funding for the Lessons from Auschwitz Universities Project, a special version of the Project aimed at addressing increasing concerns about antisemitism on campus.\nHaving played a crucial role in the establishment of Holocaust Memorial Day in the UK in 2001, the Trust continues to play a key role in the delivery of this national commemorative day.\nIn 2010 the Government issued a new award to recognise the British men and women who came to the aid of Jewish people and other persecuted groups during the Holocaust – as a direct result of an initiative by the Trust to raise their profile and secure formal recognition for them.\nAt the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Appeal Dinner in September 2013, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a national Holocaust Commission to establish what further measures should be taken to ensure a lasting memorial to the Holocaust in this country. In January 2015, the Prime Minister, with cross-party support, endorsed the Commission’s recommendations, which include a striking new national memorial and accompanying learning centre by 2022.\nIn 2015, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Royal Mint has commissioned a special commemorative medal to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust, an initiative of the Holocaust Educational Trust.\nIn July 2017, the Holocaust Educational Trust supported a visit to the former Nazi concentration camp Stutthof by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge where they met with survivors of the camp Zigi Shipper and Manfred Goldberg. This high-profile initiative helped to shine a spotlight on the importance of ensuring that the Holocaust is never forgotten.\nIn 2018, the Trust marked the eightieth anniversary of the Kindertransport with Stories from Willesden Lane, a unique educational project which engaged more than 8,500 students across London with an innovative programme of resources and events which enabled them to reflect on the experiences of Jewish child refugees. In the same year, the Trust partnered with Chelsea Football Club in its Say No To Antisemitism campaign.\nIn 2020 we will remember 75 years since the end of the Second World War and the liberation of the camps. The Trust and UCL Centre for Holocaust Studies, with support from the National Holocaust Centre and Museum, and funding from the Department for Education, will deliver Belsen 75 – a commemorative and educational project allowing young people to mark the anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by British forces on 15th April.\nWe work in schools, colleges and higher education institutions across the UK, providing a wide range of educational programmes.\nAbout Holocaust Memorial Day\nHolocaust Memorial Day was established following an MP’s visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau with the Holocaust Educational Trust. Moved by his visit, Andrew Dismore MP proposed a bill, “to introduce a day to learn and remember the Holocaust” on 30 June 1999.\nThe Holocaust Educational Trust has been closely involved in the establishment and development of Holocaust Memorial Day since its inception in 2000.

The morning after the Brexit vote, £137bn was wiped off UK blue chip stocks within minutes of markets opening. By Monday, the £ had dropped to a thirty year low of only $1.32 and the £:€ to €1.20. The UK lost its AAA credit-rating and changed from a ‘stable’ to a ‘negative’ outlook. We have seen major firms lose substantial orders, graduates having offers of employment withdrawn, major banks indicating they will relocate from London to the continent to effect continuity in their businesses.\nLet there be no doubt, European Union membership has been and is good for Scotland. It has supported over 300,000 Scottish jobs directly and indirectly and provides access to £58 billion of research and innovation funding. The EU is the top destination for Scottish exports (42%) worth around £11.6 billion in 2014. The Scotch Whisky industry was unanimous in its desire to see Scotland remain inside the EU. Scotland’s farmers and those involved in tourism were in no doubt that being part of the EU was good for business. Scotland is the most attractive part of the UK for Foreign Direct Investment in the UK with 72% of investors citing access to the internal market as an important factor. Yet despite voting overwhelming to Remain, Scotland faces being taken out of the EU against our will.\nIn 2015, there were over 2,310 foreign-owned companies in Scotland, employing around 314,000 with a combined turnover of £90 billion, around 42% of these companies were ultimately owned by firms based in the EU. This is why it has been essential for the Scottish Government to engage immediately with our European partners to reassure them that we did not vote for this outcome.\nThe value of being part of the EU trading bloc cannot be underestimated as the economic bargaining power of 28 sovereign nations allows formidable safeguards in procuring public services and maintaining safety standards. With the UK effectively outside and isolated, all of this is in jeopardy.\nIt is becoming clearer by the day that Brexit was a slogan, not a plan. We now have a United Kingdom government that is in complete disarray and an official Labour Party opposition who would rather exploit the chaos to settle personal quarrels and tear itself apart in the process. In short, Westminster has, this week, been in a state of political paralysis; rudderless, leaderless and absolutely hopeless.\nBy their actions, this Tory government has played a dangerous game of roulette with Scotland’s economy. Thankfully our First Minister has, uniquely among British politicians, seized the initiative and shown stable leadership, with Scotland’s best interests her priority.\nAs the First Minister said, the single market is crucial for Scotland’s trade, exports, innovation and productivity. The SNP at Westminster and Holyrood have committed to explore all options to secure Scotland’s place in the European Union; as I said to the Prime Minister on Monday, being forced to leave the EU against our will, is a “democratic outrage”.\nWe have called on the UK Government to take urgent action to provide the reassurance needed by the markets and to produce a comprehensive strategy to rebalance the economy.\nThe ramifications of Brexit, which Scotland did not want and did not vote for continue to unfold before us.\nBrendan O’Hara MP",

Mr Swinney today published the Scottish Government’s Education Delivery Plan, which includes measures to empower schools, simplify the Curriculum for Excellence and invest in teaching staff and their skills.\nThis blueprint for education has been informed by children and young people, teachers, parents, local authorities and unions.\nWelcoming the Deputy First Minister’s statement, SNP MSP and former teacher Jenny Gilruth said:\n“Improving our schools, and tackling the gap in achievement between children from low-income and better-off backgrounds, is the SNP’s number one priority in this parliament – and regardless of what is going on elsewhere, will remain our absolute focus.\n“As a recent teacher, I know from first-hand experience how these plans will improve our children’s learning environment – by reducing workload for our teachers, empowering schools with greater decision-making and ensuring resources go where they are needed most.\n“Every child should have the same opportunity to succeed regardless of their background. This is a blueprint to deliver on that ambition – as the SNP gets on with the job of moving Scotland forward and implementing the manifesto which received unprecedented support from people in Scotland.",

I am also delighted to hear that everyone present at this summit is in agreement about one thing and that is a need for better and more collaborative working and I welcome Humza Yousaf commitment to do everything as practicably possible to ensure the challenges are met and the islands’ potential is realised.”\nImmediately after the Summit finished, Mr. O’Hara travelled to Craighouse on Jura to host a public meeting with Humza Yousaf MSP before returning to Bowmore to meet with several local groups including TSI, the Seniors Forum, local councillors, the National Farmers Union of Scotland, South Islay Development, The islands’ Health and Social Care partnership and the small business forum to share how the Summit meeting went and to discuss what steps the local community want to take next in advancing the interest of Islay and Jura .\nThe day ended with an open meeting at which O’Hara fielded questions from the public about the Summit.",

Mr O’Hara said afterwards,\n“It has been an incredibly touching and poignant day and brought home to me just how heart-breaking it must be to lose a baby. In the past, all that midwives had to give to bereaved parents was an envelope with a few momentos of their baby but that has now changed with the Memory Box which goes someway to help parents cope with their loss. The Butterfly Release events are also incredibly important and is a way of bringing families together to remember their baby. I feel privileged to be invited along to share this day and I am honoured to release some butterflies on behalf of the families.

  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2020_10_22_9045/content_152.html": "Conservative MPs – including all Scots Tories – refuse to back free meals for children in school holidays\nYesterday afternoon in the House of Commons, Brendan O’Hara MP led for the SNP in the Opposition Day debate on access to free school meals and called on the UK Government to commit to tackling widespread poverty, exacerbated by the pandemic.\nThis is a copy of his speech:\n“It is a pleasure to speak in the debate this afternoon and to give the full support of the Scottish National Party to this Opposition motion. We very much welcome this debate, particularly as just yesterday the Scottish Government announced a £10 million package of funding for local authorities to continue providing free school meals over the forthcoming school holidays, up to and including the Easter break of 2021. The Scotish Government did that, quite simply, because in the middle of a global pandemic and with an economic crisis looming, that was the right thing to do. As the Cabinet Secretary for Social Security, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said:\nWe are doing all we can to ensure the right support gets to the right people at the right time in the right way.\nShirley-Anne Somerville, Cabinet Secretary for Social Security, Scottish Government\n“Part of getting the right support to the right people in the right way at the right time involves ensuring that those who are most exposed to the economic consequences of the pandemic know that their children will still at least have one hot meal every day, even if it is during the school holidays. I agree with Kate Green that it is remarkable that, in the 21st century, at a time like this, in one of the richest countries in the world, we are even having to debate this or to ask the Government to fund free school meals over the school holiday period to prevent 1.5 million of the poorest and most vulnerable children in England from going hungry.\nI, too, would like to pay tribute to the work done by Marcus Rashford to shine a light on this issue. As a hugely successful young professional athlete, it would have been so easy for him not to have done what he has, but it is a measure of him as a person that he has not forgotten where he came from and the struggle that his family and others had to endure every day growing up. In his public petition, he is asking the Government to keep going with the free school meal programme that was put in place over the summer holidays and did so much to help children from low-income families, who have been hardest hit by the pandemic. It is not a huge ask, but it has struck a chord across these islands, including several hundred of my constituents in Argyll & Bute, who, although not directly affected by this, have been struck by the sincerity and compassion of this young man.\n“Sadly, that compassion was not replicated in the Government’s response to the petition reaching 300,000 signatures. Their spokesperson said: “It’s not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays. We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through Universal Credit rather than government subsidising meals.”\n“Of course, they said that when the Government had just announced that they were taking the £20 universal credit uplift away. That particularly dismissive, not to say callous, response exposes just how hollow the Chancellor’s promise was back in the summer to do “whatever it takes” to help people through this crisis. As we head into what will certainly be very difficult times this winter, with coronavirus cases on the rise, prompting fears of a second wave, taking away food from under- privileged children seems a perverse way of doing whatever it takes to help. Bizarrely, that same UK Government spokesperson said of the summer holiday school meal scheme:\n“This is a specific measure to reflect the unique circumstances of the pandemic” as if we had somehow come through it all, the pandemic had gone and everything had returned to normal. Is that really what the Government wanted to say? Is that the message that they wanted to get out? If so, it is palpable nonsense, as any health professional, self-employed worker, hospitality business owner, seasonal worker or someone who is about to lose their furlough will confirm—as will the parent and carer of every poor child in England whose income has fallen and are now reliant on food banks and for whom a free school meal had become almost a daily necessity.\nChildren going hungry in a country as rich as this is a consequence—a direct consequence—of political choices.\n“This is a political choice. There is no doubt that if this Government prioritised eradicating poverty, the money would be found in an instant, because poverty is not accidental. It is not inevitable. It is a political choice. Poverty is not something that happens by accident. Children going hungry in a country as rich as this is a consequence—a direct consequence—of political choices. A decade of austerity in which the poorest and weakest in our society were forced to carry the can and bear the brunt of a financial crisis that had nothing to do with them was a political choice, and so too is the decision to take away poor children’s food during an economic and health crisis. It is staggering.”\nThis is the link to the vote on the debate https://www.theyworkforyou.com/divisions/pw-2020-10-21-154-commons",

This is exactly why we are doing all we can to safeguard Scotland’s position in the single market”\n“It is inconceivable that the Tories can bend the rules for one firm in the North East of England but refuses to engage with the will of an entire nation”\n“We still don’t know the full details of the Nissan deal, what was in this written promise and how much is it likely to cost the taxpayer at any point in the future?”.\n“If Theresa May’s Tory Government can exercise ‘flexible Brexit’ for one – it can offer ‘flexible Brexit’ for all.\n“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain inside the EU which is why the Scottish Government is working to build a coalition to keep Scotland and the rest of the UK inside the single market. Over the next few weeks the Scottish Government will be publishing plans to retain Scotland’s access to the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. Preventing potential trade barriers with a marketplace of 500 million people will guard against potentially thousands of Scottish jobs being unnecessarily lost.",

It is politically motivated, and it is vindictive.\nAnd I believe when viewed in the context of other legislation going through parliament around voter suppression, the right to peaceful protest, and undermining theelectoral commission… I think it is deeply worrying for our democracy.\nNot only is it further evidence of a government which is allergic to criticism and terrified of independent scrutiny but it’s also one which is ideologically driven to undermine anything that proves public services can be delivered successfully by a publicly owned organisation.\nBy any measure, Channel 4 is and has been a success.\nIt has more than met the remit it was given and, as we’ve heard, has been responsible for some of the greatest creative and commercial successes in UK television and film in the past forty years.\nIt has given creative opportunities to people and their ideas who otherwise would never have had their voice heard.\nAnd it has taken a London-centric industry and reminded them that there is life on these islands beyond London.\nIn short, Channel 4 has achieved what it was asked to do and the viewers like what it does.\nSo why is this government so determine to change something which has been a demonstrable success?\nIt’s not for the money.\nBecause of the way it is structured, Channel 4 hasn’t got shelves of tapes and a mountain of intellectual property-rights waiting to attract a potential buyer so, any money likely to be generated from a sale is in relative terms, minimal.\nIt is also beyond credible to believe that the UK Government honestly believes that viewers will be better served by Channel 4 being subsumed into one of the huge international TV conglomerates.\nBecause as it’s currently constituted, Channel 4 can experiment with formats, it can take risks with new writers, and it can occasionally bomb…without having explaining to an angry accountant representing a consortium of international investors why profits are down this year?\nAnd let’s be honest, not one of those multi-national TV giants going to give two hoots for the hugely successful model of spending outside of London and supporting independent film and television production in the nations and regions.\nThe Government also know that despite OFCOM finding it was one of the most trusted media sources of information on the pandemic, no multi-national giant profit-driven international TV corporation is going to invest money and continue to support the multi-award-winning, Channel 4 News?\nAnd that’s where this begins to make sense, becausein the absence of any commercial, creative or public interest reason for privatising Channel 4, one can only conclude their motivation is politically driven spite.\nBecause Channel 4 is the one thing that they fear most; a public service broadcaster which is delivering good, informed, wholly independent news; and one that makes people think and question and challenge what’s going on.\nAnd unlike the BBC, Channel 4’s greatest strength is that it provides its public service remit without relying on UK government for its finance.\nUnfortunately, its greatest strength has become its greatest weakness.\nBecause when you have a government that is gerrymandering the electoral map, curtailing citizen’s right to protest and removing the teeth from the country’s democratic watchdog, the last thing they want is an independent, non-compliant media.\nAnd that, more than anything else explains why they are determined to privatise Channel 4, because what they know is if they privatise Channel 4 that it won’t come back… but hasn’t that been the UK government’s intention from the start?”",

I will continue to support and work with WASPI Argyll and Isles who are determined to fight on until a remedy to this problem is found” Anne Greer, co-founder of the group said, “Some Argyll and Bute women have been campaigning as individuals on behalf of WASPI for over a year and we have appreciated Brendan’s support during this time.

It’s high time Theresa May reigned in her chaotic Cabinet, and brought forward a credible and sensible plan that puts the interests of the UK ahead her party’s hard Brexiteers.”\nBrendan O’Hara MP added “Crucially, this lack of clarity will affect Argyll & Bute and other rural communities disproportionately as they are also set to lose £138 million of funding through the loss of the EU’s LEADER fund, which helps boost businesses, tourism, productivity and services in rural areas.\n“The Prime Minister must provide answers ,the UK government’s dithering and very public divisions is causing serious harm to the UK’s economy, business stability and jobs market “",

I honestly believe that Argyll and Bute produces some of the finest food and drink in the world and I wanted to showcase this here in Westminster . I was determined that this wasn’t just a tasting event and I wanted as many of the top-end buyers along to sample what we have to offer. It would be absolutely wonderful if as a result of this event, our producers returned to Argyll & Bute with some orders on their books or some new business leads. I am very grateful to my co-host, Eleanor the Duchess of Argyll and ‘Food from Argyll’ who have given fantastic support for this event and to everyone who attended and made this such a success”.\nEleanor, The Duchess of Argyll who was equally delighted and impressed with the event added,\n“We knew that an offering of some of the best in food from Argyll would be a draw, but the response to one of Scotland’s most famous food destinations was amazing. The room was packed and the enthusiasm for the produce from across Argyll was fantastic”.\nClaire Fletcher from Lussa Gin who travelled all the way from the Isle of Jura to showcase their gin which they romantically describe as ‘as fresh and wild as the island they live on’ said of the experience,\n“We’ve had a great afternoon here at Westminster and have made some really useful contacts as well as setting foot inside one of the most iconic buildings in the UK. And people must have enjoyed their Lussa Gin as we ran out of tonic!”\nJennifer Nicol, of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, also gave the event her support saying;\n“This event has provided a great opportunity to demonstrate a sample of the quality produce available from the Argyll region, and the fantastic experience and enthusiasm of the producers involved. We hope to see even more Argyll produce in the restaurants and food stores throughout the UK, and look forward to working with the businesses involved as they further expand their markets in the UK and internationally.”\nAnd Virginia Sumison, Co-ordinator at Food from Argyll, the umbrella group for producers who supported the event and who describe the region as Scotland’s ‘natural larder’ finished off by saying,\n“We are delighted by the turnout at the House of Commons today and it has been very useful in making new contacts and meeting up with old friends and new.

The people and businesses of Argyll and Bute, as well as our many visitors, have had to put up with so much for far too long, they must able to travel across the constituency unhindered.\n“Unfortunately, as we all know the growing impact of Climate Change on our weather systems has wreaked havoc on the A83 and since August we have all had to travel via the Old Military Road or, more recently, drive the Rest under traffic light control. The only alternative being a significantly lengthy diversion which takes more time and adds to the cost of every journey.”\nMr O’Hara added: Even this week, the inclement weather has again resulted in the A83 being closed and motorists having to use the OMR or alternate routes. I absolutely agree that this cannot go on; the A83 is the trunk route into Argyll & Bute and the gateway to the highlands and our islands. It is as important to this area as any other trunk route is to those living elsewhere in Scotland and we must find a long-term sustainable solution.\n“Transport Scotland has opened its public consultation and has put forward its 11 preferred options.\n“I would ask everyone to contribute to that and help ensure this area gets the best long-term solution possible.”\nYou can make your views know by logging into the website and following the links\nhttps://www.transport.gov.scot/publication/project-corridor-options-access-to-argyll-and-bute-a83/ The consultation closes on October 30.\nMr O’Hara added: “As many constituents may know, I have been a strong advocate for a tunnel for several years now having seen how the network of very basic tunnels keep the Faroe Islands connected whatever the weather.\n“I was very disappointed therefore to see that a tunnel is not on the list of 11 options being looked at by Transport Scotland as a permanent fix. I am sure that this long-term solution would be favoured by many people who want to ensure that the main artery through Argyll is accessible all year round and I will be contributing to the consultation to make Transport Scotland aware of the importance of an all-weather route.\n“Whatever option is chosen, however, we have to make sure it is the best option for the people of Argyll & Bute and that means letting Transport Scotland know what we think so please take part in this consultation.”",

This follows weeks of revelations regarding Tory sleaze and the elevation of many wealthy donors to the Lords.\nOver the past few weeks, I have heard from many constituents disgusted by the antics of the Conservative party and its disregard for due process and reports that a donation of £3m to the party can effectively buy you a seat in the House of Lords.\nI asked two questions in my capacity as SNP spokesperson for the Cabinet Office and Constitution.\nFirstly I asked, if the Minister was concerned about Prime Minister’s reply to my colleague, the MP for Na h-Eileanan an Lar, who last week asked if he would “stop sending big-value donors to the House of Lords”\nThe Prime Minister replied: “Until you get rid of the system by which Trades Union barons fund other parties … we need to continue with the system by which public-spirited people give donations”\nI told the House I believe the Prime Minister’s answer comes dangerously close to an admission of selling Peerages, in contravention of the 1925 Honours Prevention of Abuse Act, and is I believe, worthy of further investigation. Today, I asked if he would undertake an investigation or is it sufficiently serious to involve the Metropolitan Police.\nSecondly, I asked if the Minister could explain why, since 2010, 22 of the Conservative party’s wealthiest backers – who between them have donated £54million to the Tories – have been appointed to the House of Lords.\nI asked him if he thought is was acceptable that his party were stuffing the Lords full of their cronies, political allies and even those unwilling or unable to get elected, and if he really believes this improves or enhances our democracy.\nAs you can see from my question and his response, the minister makes an abysmal attempt to justify this.",

Forty years ago the fishing industry was sold down the river by the then Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath and his government used it as a bargaining chip in becoming a member of the EEC. We will take no lectures from the Scottish Tory MPs about the failings of the Common Fisheries Policy; their fingerprints are all over it. Heath regarded the industry as expendable, Thatcher signed up the doomed CFP and after years of mismanagement, John Major’s government signed up to a revised CFP which ripped the heart out of the industry and destroyed livelihoods in the process. And now as we are leaving they plan to do it all over again to Scotland. The Tories will never be forgiven for selling out the industry again.”\nHe went on to say,\n“Debating the fisheries bill, I looked across at a lot of red faces in the benches opposite because, despite the Scottish Tories’ attempts to position themselves as the champion of the Scottish fishing industry, promising that we would leave the CFP after March 2019, they have been hung out to dry by their own Prime Minister”. David Mundell who promised to stand up for Scotland and resign if we didn’t leave the CFP, has lost the last remaining scraps of principle and credibility that he had.”\n“ Only an independent Scottish Government can adequately look after the interests of our fishing industry; only an independent Scottish Government can recognise the significance of this industry’s contribution to our economy; and only an independent Scottish Government can be relied upon not to use our fishing industry as a bargaining chip.”\nThe stark truth is that the glib and hollow promises made in last year General Election by career-hungry candidates wearing blue rosettes are now unravelling, because they were all predicated on a UK Government acting in the best interests of the Scottish fishing industry. History has taught them nothing. I look forward to the day when an independent Scotland, as a member of the European Union, can help to shape a common fisheries policy that works for us and is of benefit to our neighbours as well”.\nDraft Political Statement\nDraft_Political_Declaration",

The results suggest the SNP could gain seats right across Scotland from the Tories at an election – with every seat in play.\nThe poll also shows that, in the event of another EU referendum, 63% of respondents in the thirteen Tory seats say they would vote to stay in the EU, while 63% think a no-deal Brexit would make independence more likely.\nCommenting, SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford MP said:\n“This stunning poll underlines the strength of opposition to Brexit in Scotland – and shows the SNP is the only party in Scotland that can stop Brexit and stand up to the Tories.\n“Boris Johnson’s reckless plans for an extreme Brexit would be devastating – threatening to destroy 100,000 Scottish jobs and inflict lasting harm on living standards, public services, and the economy. It is shameful that Scottish Tory MPs have completely failed to oppose them.\n“People in Scotland deserve a choice over their future – rather than having a Brexit imposed on us, against our will, by Westminster.

She steadfastly refused to answer, so today I asked the Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack MP, if he could answer that question. As you will see from the video clip, he does not take the concerns of Scotland’s food and drink industry seriously and seems dismissive of concerns voiced across the sector.\nIt is incredulous that the UK Government, which is putting so many resources into saving the union, would rather sign a trade deal – any deal – even if this could damage our industries and put thousands of jobs at risk. If they are so confident there is industry backing for it they should’ve put the deal to a vote. They did not.\nThe Scottish Secretary is supposed to be standing up for Scotland but, instead, all he has done is cover for his Westminster masters, telling me the trade deal will be as good for producers here as it will be for those in Australia.\nThis was my question to him:\n“This government’s plan to strengthen the union seems to be to first, sell-out the fishing industry and then, betray Scotland’s farmers.\nSo can the Secretary of State explain how the Australian trade deal which allows the UK market to be flooded with thousands of tonnes of cheap, factory-farmed, inferior-qulaity beef and lamb, is the “Golden Opportunity” the Prime Minister promised, and how will it help Scottish farmers business?”\nIt is clear that the Scottish Tories have no intention of standing up for Scotland.\nJust days ago, in a BBC Sunday Show interview Douglas Ross – an MSP as well as an MP – repeatedly dodged questions and gave misleading answers when asked about the impact of the Australia trade deal on Scotland’s farmers and crofters.\nWhen challenged by presenter Martin Geissler “why was there no dialogue between the UK and Scottish Government?” – Douglas Ross dodged the question.\nWhen challenged about the concerns of Scotland’s farming communities on tariff-free imports, the Scottish Tory leader claimed, “I can understand concerns have been highlighted but I’m not sure we will see them coming to fruition”.\nWhen challenged on the threat of zero-tariff deals with the USA, Brazil and other countries, Mr Ross claimed “they are very separate deals… we have said there is no precedent in any of these deals, we go about them on an individual basis”.\nMy colleague, SNP Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson, Deidre Brock MP said afterwards:\n“Yet again, Douglas Ross is failing to stand up for Scotland over the damaging Tory Australia trade deal, which poses a growing threat to Scottish farmers and crofters.\n“It speaks volumes that the Scottish Tory leader was unable to name any benefits for Scottish beef and lamb farmers – who face being undercut on price and standards, and left unable to compete with industrial-scale farming abroad.\n“Scotland has been sidelined, ignored and kept in the dark throughout these negotiations. No meaningful protections have been introduced for Scottish farmers and crofters, who are being completely shafted – just as the Tories sold out Scotland’s fishing communities through Brexit.\n“There is the very real danger that many Scottish farmers and crofters will lose income and be put out of business, with agricultural workers losing their jobs, if the Australia deal goes ahead in its current form – especially if it is replicated in future deals with the USA, Brazil and other industrial farming countries that will also demand tariff-free access to the UK.\n“It’s simply not credible for Douglas Ross to claim that no precedent has been set for future trade deals – when it clearly has. It’s clear the Scottish Tories will roll over and rubber stamp any Downing Street deal, no matter how damaging it is for Scotland.\n“Scotland is increasingly vulnerable under Westminster control. It’s clearer than ever that the only way to keep Scotland safe from the long-term damage of Brexit and Tory trade deals is to become an independent country.”",

It is also reported that the prime minister has – unbelievably ‘been kept in the dark by defence chiefs’ who have been too alarmed to inform Number 10.\nThis follows the recent attempt to cover up a serious malfunction at a Trident missile launch test, which was also covered up and caused huge embarrassment to the prime minister when she repeatedly refused to answer if she had been aware of it.\nBrendan O’Hara MP, SNP Defence spokesperson said:\n“Reports of all seven attack submarines being out of action are astonishing. If – as reported – our complete lack of any submarine attack capability was ‘kept from the prime minister’ – then it is simply indefensible.\n“First there was the recent Trident malfunction fiasco, now we have this chilling situation. How can we possibly trust those in charge of our defence when we hear about this utter incompetence and yet another Whitehall nuclear cover up. It is a scandal.\n“This latest Whitehall farce could be dangerously undermining the very core of the UK government’s defence position of the Continuous-At-Sea-Deterrent.\n“With the ballooning – out of control costs of Trident, the remainder of our conventional defences are being cut to the bone to pay for it. We must have a basic right to know if it is fulfilling its role.\n‘’Do we presently have an operational Continuous-At-Sea-Deterrent? Has it been in interrupted – and if so for how long? Do we have any operational submarines currently at sea? Was the prime minister told of any of these problems or were officials so scared of the reaction that they concealed it from her? – as is reported today.\n“These are all questions I have submitted to the Ministry of Defence today. What is also worrying is whether essential repairs and maintenance, now clearly desperate and urgent, will once again cut into the ever dwindling money-pot to pay for our most basic of conventional defences?’’",

The group of 18 islands, slightly less than Argyll and Bute is connected by a vast network of tunnels and bridges although 80% are by tunnels.\nWith the difficulties of Argyll and Bute and the Highlands connecting with the mainland, looking to the Faroes was an obvious choice and last week, Mr O’Hara, a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Faroe Islands, together with Angus Brendan MacNeil MP (Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Faroe Islands and MP for the Western Isles) and Aki Johansen, representative of the Faroese Government met with Humza Yousaf MSP, Minister for Transport and the Islands, at Holyrood on a fact-finding discussion on how the Faroe Islands are connected by tunnels.\nCommenting Brendan O’Hara MP said:\n“Last week, we were in Edinburgh for a meeting with Transport Minister Humza Yousaf, to see what Scotland can learn from the Faroe Islands in terms of connecting remote and island communities with undersea tunnels. To date, the Faroese have 19 tunnels connecting all of their main islands, with others under construction.

Across Scotland in the past two years there have been nine new distilleries built and there are another forty planned over the next two decades. The government can’t just treat this industry as a cash-cow and I sincerely hope they build on last year’s success by announcing a further reduction in duty in this year’s Budget. There is a bright future for the whisky industry and that means a bright future for Argyll & Bute”",

We now know that long before Parliament formally voted on whether or not to go to war in Iraq, Tony Blair had told George Bush – “I will be with you whatever”.\n“The subsequent actions of the then Prime Minister blundered the country into a war that has caused the deaths of 179 UK armed forces personnel, and almost 200,000 Iraqi civilians, and led the world into the present nightmare instability in the Middle East. It is shameful that the Chilcot Report found the UK’s actions undermined the authority of the UN Security Council, and the Prime Minister’s lack of commitment to collective decision-making and his determination to stand with the US before diplomatic options had been exhausted, led the country prematurely to war. It is now clear from the report that military action was not the last resort as Blair stood in Parliament on 18 March 2003 to ask MPs to support his case for war.\n“And when the Iraqi regime headed by Saddam Hussein was toppled, Chilcot has found that it was Tony Blair who increased the risk of the UK failing to react to the unexpected in Iraq, and damaged the likelihood of achieving strategic objectives. There was no plan for the reconstruction of Iraq and for the provision of services to the Iraqi people, and there was no plan to deal with the violence that we saw explode in the months following the invasion.\n“In the days, weeks and months ahead, the intimate detail of this report will only implicate further a former Prime Minister who recklessly committed the country to war without collective judgement, and personally failed to ensure there was a plan for delivering a future for the people of Iraq.\n“After such carnage, people will ask inevitable questions of was conflict inevitable and worthwhile? The answer from Chilcot is undoubtedly no. And who is responsible? The answer is undoubtedly Tony Blair. There must now be a consideration of what political or legal consequences are appropriate for those responsible.”",

Brexit and the loss of the single market with its 500 million potential customers, will undoubtedly have serious consequences for the scotch whisky industry.”\nBrendan continued; “Knowing how important EU membership is giving us access to the single market, the people of Argyll & Bute and Scotland voted emphatically to remain in the European Union. Our voice has to be heard and our decision has to be respected; I fully support First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon’s determination to keep Scotland in the European Union”.\nSpeaking after the meeting Ranald Watson, Springbank’s Sales and marketing manager said;\n“The main concern which we have specific to our group of companies, alongside those which we share with the wider whisky industry, relates to our network of Cadenhead Whisky Shops.\nWe have four shops in the EU at the moment – two in Germany, one in Austria and one in Denmark – which, alongside our three UK shops account for over 50% of William Cadenhead Ltd’s turnover. Anything which makes exporting to EU countries more difficult or more expensive than at present is a major concern for us as 50% of our business is a lot to risk.\nOf further concern is the potential impact EU withdrawal could have on visitors to this country. At the moment, visitors from other EU countries account for a huge percentage of the number of people we get through the doors of Springbank Distillery. While we have no doubt that some people will still holiday in Scotland, an EU withdrawal could have a major impact on their spending habits once here if they are restricted in how many bottles of whisky they can take home with them. At a time when we are trying to grow the visitor side of our business we are aghast at the prospect of the number of visitors and their potential spend being reduced, particularly since Scotland was so heavily in favour of remaining in the EU.”",

It was however a different story for residents and farmers in Glen Fruin where even snow ploughs struggled to cut through the compacted snow. Families became trapped in their houses with diminishing food supplies and with no veterinary services able to reach the farms, animals and pregnant livestock were in danger.\nResponding to the Glen Fruin crisis, local MP Brendan O’Hara said,\n“These families, some with young children had very little food and essentials to keep them going, vets were unable to reach farms and essential supplies could not be delivered. With the police and the council workers and the community all working together, the road was finally cleared. I understand roads superintendent Donald Connelly and his team had to bring in a digger to finally clear access to the road after days of being unpassable.”\nHe went onto say,\n“I would like to say a special thank you to everyone who worked tirelessly to deal with this situation and to all the council workers across Argyll and Bute who put in extra special effort to get everyone on the move again. It is in fact great testament to what can be achieved when the community comes together.”\nCouncillor Lorna Douglas who was contacted by a father whose daughter was one of those stranded said,\n“It became clear very quickly that this was a particularly bad situation and required extra special effort from everyone to resolve. From council staff, the police to the community itself, thankfully the situation was brought under control.\nShe added,\n“The one thing that has struck me about the severe weather disruption, is the care and concern that is in Helensburgh and across Argyll and Bute where people came to the help of their neighbours. I would also like to pay tribute to those council workers who literally worked around the clock to clear those roads in the most dreadful conditions.”",

This is an opportune time to consider today’s veterans and service personnel and their place in society.\nEvery year, around 1800 service personnel make the transition into civilian life and around 40% of those report health or welfare difficulties during this time. But they can also suffer from financial issues, employment issues, social issues and need relationship support. Much of that support comes from charities.\nIn 2014, the Scottish Government launched their first ever Veterans Commissioner which has resulted in a number of funded initiatives for Scottish veterans. Fundamentally, our service personnel, when leaving the forces should suffer no disadvantage from having served and this is an overriding principal for the Scottish Government and its strategic partners.\nMilitary service fosters leadership, organisational skills, resilience and specialist skills such as medical or technical expertise. Veterans – and their families – are a great asset for the private sector, and a growing number of employers are actively targeting veterans to fill their skills gaps. The Scottish Government have made specific provision to support our Veterans, both in priority healthcare, housing support and ensuring service families and their children have as much access to an equal education as those in civilian life. Scotland can and should be the destination of choice for those leaving the armed forces, the contribution they make to Scottish society is invaluable”.",

In the aftermath of Covid and Brexit our High Streets will need support to recover and thrive. Abandoning them now will not aid these recovery efforts.\n“Banking services must be secured in Argyll & Bute, not eroded any further.\n“I have written to TSB to request an urgent meeting and rest assured, I will fight to keep our local branches open.”\nYou can sign the petition by clicking the link here:\nhttps://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/save-tsb-branches-in-argyll-bute-from-closure",

However, the government regularly tells us abuse of the system is the reason for reform of all manner of legislation that simply doesn’t suit them. They rarely manage to produce anything other than anecdotal evidence, evidence that wouldn’t stand up in a court of law ironically enough. So this time, I asked him if we can see the evidence?\nHe says the UK will remain a party to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but as I said in the earlier question session, different ministers give us different answers. I asked if he would confirm that the UK Government will respect provisions in the ECHR in full, with no tinkering and no equivocation.\nIt really does takes some brass neck for this government to invoke a history of upholding human rights, coming (as this statement does) hot on the heels of multiple, dreadful pieces of legislation designed to trash those rights. Legislation such as the Policing bill, the Elections Bill, The Judicial Review Bill and perhaps the most hideous of all, the Nationality and Borders bill.\nI also talked about Scotland and asked if he appreciates how utterly fundamental the Human Rights Act is to how the devolution settlement works and if he recognised that any change would be a recasting of the UK’s constitution.\nIf this was happening elsewhere, there would be double majorities and referenda required before any changes could be implemented.\nI was fully aware the Secretary of State would come back to me talking about “consultation” with the devolved governments. But it’s not enough – I told him we would demand that nothing will be done without the permission of the Scottish Government.\nWhile he may have little respect for the democratically elected government of Scotland, he needs to understand how much the people of Scotland value their human rights and quite how outraged they will be by this.\nI told him, “My party will fight to protect human rights across these islands and indeed across the globe. But the people of Scotland can do that in our country simply by voting yes at the next Independence referendum. The Justice Secretary has today played his part in ensuring that happens.”\nYou can hear more by clicking the link below.",

Brendan O’Hara, local MP commented “The town has been on a twelve month\nhigh following the many promises of funding at both the base and the waterfront; but so far, neither promise has actually delivered any additional benefit to the Constituency I represent”.\n“Faslane is largely accessible via the A82 and specifically the A814. These roads are single-carriageway and lifeline routes for the constituency. The A82 has attracted significant investment in recent years via the SNP Government. The A814 however, can be a perilous and narrow route and whenever there is an accident on the A82, traffic is diverted along the A814.\nI have been inundated by Constituent complaints about the road\nwhenever there’s been a tragic accident.”\nWhilst the local authority have installed signage to deter larger vehicles, the route is often congested if the A82 is obstructed. Upgrading the A814 would be a significant and costly undertaking and given that it services the Faslane base, it does not seem unreasonable that central funding be made available by the UK\nGovernment to make substantial upgrades thereto.\nBrendan O’Hara further commenting “on the back of David Mundell MP, sole Tory voice in Scotland and Secretary of State’s visit to the area last week, I took this opportunity, whilst the visit was still fresh in his mind, to write to him about what I see as an essential part of the UK Government’s investment at Faslane.\nIt does not seem unreasonable that if the amount of traffic entering and leaving Faslane and surrounding sites is set to increase considerably over the next few years, servicing an asset under the control of the UK Government, that the local authority and Scottish Government should have to meet the cost of ensuring that those roads are fit for purpose. With so much investment at the base, it would be unacceptable for Helensburgh and Lomond to become the poor relation to the base. I have specifically asked David Mundell\nMP to “present a favourable case for the necessary investment locally” within Central Government.”\n“I look forward to reporting back that this funding will be forthcoming and that Helensburgh and Lomond will secure the future infrastructure it desperately needs.”",

In Argyll and Bute, we have a higher proportion of older people and our remote and rural geography which can make loneliness even more prevalent.\nLoneliness can affect our physical health, our mental health, can even increase the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease, a cause I have particular interest in.\nThe NHS Highland campaign are looking to raise awareness and encourage the public to pledge to help tackle loneliness. I believe Scottish society has a long tradition of social engagement with our friends and neighbours and we care. Loneliness can be so easily overlooked. This campaign will be running throughout 2016 and 2017. I would urge us all to take a moment and engage with this campaign and if nothing else, be aware that loneliness is a very real problem.\n• Campaign materials can be found at https://www.facebook.com/NHSHighlandReachOut/",

The prospects for Jamie and Jonathan’s forward-thinking look set to be a massive boost to both his business and to the growing world-wide reputation of Argyll and Bute seafood.\nBack in November 2017, Jamie came along to local MP, Brendan O’Hara’s Chinese Business Summit, combining the efforts of the China British Business Council, Scottish Development International and Highland and Islands Enterprise to bring the Chinese market opportunities to Argyll and Bute companies.\nCommenting, Jamie McMillan said “This was not an easy undertaking, it has taken months of dedication to get to our first export.” He added: “We recognised quickly in 2016 that our business might not survive the uncertainty of leaving the EU. We needed to look at our options quickly. The Summit came at the right time for us and we seized that opportunity.”\nOver the course of two days in November 2017, the Argyll & Bute MP took the presentation to Oban, Inveraray and Campbeltown where local businesses were introduced to the possibilities of expanding into the Far East.\nSpeaking as Jamie and Jonathan prepared another 1000kg batch of the premium west coast product for export, Brendan O’Hara said: “I remember the folk at Loch Fyne Langoustine coming to our meeting in Campbeltown and how keen they were to explore this further. They had enough foresight to see that because of Brexit, the markets on which they had depended could be under threat. From the outset, the business was committed to doing this and they’ve worked incredibly hard to get this foothold in the ever-expanding Chinese market.\nI am absolutely delighted that they have taken full advantage of the opportunity presented to them and I wish them every success in the future.”\nJamie McMillan added “there was a huge demand for Scottish shellfish in China and at the rate we’re going, our turnover could nearly double with more demand for staff on the horizon.”\nConcluding, Brendan O’Hara added “Loch Fyne Langoustines are proof that hard work pays off but equally, the West Coast of Scotland and particularly Argyll and Bute has a quality of produce that will sell the world over.”",

The UK government wants to do this by 31st December 2023, risking vital law that protects many rights and standards disappearing overnight.\nIt also gives the Scottish Parliament just one year to legislate to protect 47 years worth of EU regulations.\nThe bill will also allow UK government ministers to act in policy areas that are devolved, without the consent of the Scottish Government, directly contradicting devolution and the Sewel Convention.\nCommenting, the SNP’s Cabinet Office spokesperson Brendan O’Hara MP, said:\n“Just like the Tories’ Internal Market Bill, the ‘Brexit Freedoms’ Bill is another attempt at a power-grab on Scotland and threatens vital protections – yet Liz Truss and her Cabinet are determined to push it through anyway.\n“With the UK government imposing such a reckless deadline, there is a real risk that laws protecting rights and standards – such as holiday pay, parental leave, and the 48-hour work week, as well as good air and water quality – could simply drop off the statute books overnight.\n“It also rides roughshod over the devolution settlement, by giving UK ministers the power to act within devolved areas without consent from the Scottish Government.\n“Not only has the Tories’ hard Brexit taken a sledge-hammer to our economy and living standards, the Westminster government has attempted to use it on multiple occasions now to undermine the Scottish Government and democracy, making clear that their “union of equals” rhetoric is utterly hollow.\n“Scotland, and our government, has for too long been using time, money and energy to undo or mitigate damaging policies implemented by a Westminster government we didn’t vote for. It’s clear that Scotland must escape the broken Westminster system and gain the full powers of independence.”\nENDS\nArticle image by Ivan Marc.",

We have been able to move to this phase at this time because of the good progress made in suppressing COVID-19 in Scotland.\nThe virus hasn’t gone away though and throughout phase two, it will be crucial for everyone to play their part by observing the updated guidance and maintaining social distancing measures. Remember to keep at least 2 metres away from people outside your own household, continue to wash your hands regularly, and wear a face covering in shops and on public transport.\nDuring phase two, it is important that you stay in your local area for leisure purposes, that is no more than five miles from your home. It is hoped this restriction will be lifted in phase three.\nRemember also that Test and Protect is now in place across Scotland. This is Scotland’s way of putting into practice the ‘test, trace, isolate, support’ strategy. If you start showing any symptoms of coronavirus—that is a high temperature or fever, a new continuous cough, or a loss of, or change in sense of smell or taste— then you should visit the NHS Inform website to book a test immediately.\nTo help you better understand what the new rules are, I’ve summarised them below. The full guidance is available on the Scottish Government website.\nPlease continue to follow these rules to stay safe, protect others, and save lives.\nFrom today (Thursday 18th June)\n- Anyone who is shielding, unless they live in a nursing home or residential care home, can go outdoors for exercise.\nFrom tomorrow (Friday 19th June)\n- Those in the shielding group can also take part in non-contact outdoor activities.\n- Those in the shielding group can meet outdoors with one other household, in groups of no more than 8. Social distancing must be maintained.\n- People from one household can meet outdoors with people from up to 2 other households. This should be no more than two at a time, and no more than two in a single day. The advice remains that there should be no more than eight people in any group.\n- The guidance has been changed to permit you to go into the home of another household for the purposes of using the toilet. Doing so, you should avoid touching surfaces and immediately clean any that you do touch.\n- Anybody who lives on their own or only with children under the age of 18 can form an extended household group with one other household. Within extended household groups, people can meet indoors without physical distancing and stay overnight. No member of such a household group should form a similar group with another household. An extended household must not include anyone who is shielding. Should anybody in the extended group test positive for coronavirus, then the entire household group will need to self-isolate.\nFrom Monday 22nd June\n- Face coverings will be mandatory on all public transport. This includes taxis and private hire cars, buses, trains, subway, planes and ferries. The will be some exemptions, for example children under five , people with breathing difficulties, and people with physical conditions which make it difficult to keep a face covering in place.\n- The construction sector can move to the next phase of its restart plan, and then move through the remaining stages subject to consultation with the Scottish Government.\n- Dentists may reopen for urgent care.\n- Professional sport may resume behind closed doors.\n- Places of worship will reopen for individual prayer.\nFrom Monday 29th June\n- Some indoor workplaces that have opted to remain closed in line with guidance such as factories, labs, and warehouses, can start to reopen. Nonessential offices and call centres should remain closed.\n- Outdoor markets can reopen.\n- Outdoor playgrounds and sports centres can reopen.\n- Outside businesses such as zoos and garden attractions can reopen. People should not travel more than five miles from home to visit them.\n- Restrictions on moving house will be lifted.\n- Registration offices will be open for essential business\n- Marriages and civil partnerships will be permitted, but only outdoors at this stage and with limited numbers.\n- Retail premises of all sizes can reopen, but only if they have outdoor entrances and exits. For the time being, shopping centres must remain closed, except for access to essential shops such as supermarkets. Indoor shopping centres can prepare to reopen fully for phase three.\n- Optometry practices will reopen for emergency and essential services.\nOther changes during phase two\n- There will be a more significant reopening of health services.\n- More GP services will be available and GP practices will make visits to shielded patients.\n- Some care services that were postponed will restart.\n- Some public services will reopen gradually.\n- Public transport will operate increased services.\n- Some outdoor hospitality might be able to restart, however this is subject to further scientific advice and the First Minister will make a further statement on this in due course.\n- The First Minister has requested a review into the minimum safe social distance that you must keep from others. A further statement will follow in due course, but for now this remains at 2 metres.\n- People should continue to work from home where possible.\n- The Scottish Government is considering making face covering mandatory in shops and a further statement on this will be given before 29th June.",

Does the Minister agree with me that to foster an environment in which innovation can flourish, business and industry have to be able to trust what they are told by the Government? Given that, will she take this opportunity to explain to the shipbuilding industry exactly why she did not deliver on the copper-bottomed assurances, which she gave on at least four occasions, that the national shipbuilding strategy would be published before the autumn statement?\nHarriett Baldwin\nShare this contribution\nMr Speaker, did you pick up in that question any congratulations on or delight at the fact that I was at the shipyards on the Clyde on Thursday, cutting steel for two new offshore patrol vessels? I remain astonished at the very grudging way in which the Scottish National party fails to recognise the billions of pounds of work that is being sent to shipyards on the Clyde.\nBrendan O’Hara\nFor the record, I am absolutely delighted that the OPVs are being built on the Clyde.

In total, more than 700,000 people in the UK are on the Anthony Nolan register, any of whom could be a match for someone with blood cancer and asked to donate their stem cells to give a patient a second chance of life.\nNow, Mr O’Hara is encouraging more people, particularly men aged 16-30 and people from black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds, to register as stem cell donors and make sure that a match is available for everyone in need of a transplant. While anyone on the register could be a match for someone with blood cancer, men aged 16-30 are most likely to be asked to donate. They provide more than 50% of donations yet make up just 16% of the register. There is also a shortage of donors from non-white and mixed-race backgrounds.\nMr O’Hara said MP said:\n“I am very proud that Argyll and Bute has over 2000 people who have selflessly volunteered to give someone a second chance at life. Donating stem cells is straightforward but it could make an enormous difference to someone with no other chance of a cure. I strongly hope that more people from our community will be inspired to sign up and show that together, we can provide a cure for blood cancer. The Anthony Nolan charity have asked me to pass on their sincere thanks to those who have registered particularly the 174 individuals who have joined the list in the last 12 months.\nHenny Braund, Chief Executive of Anthony Nolan, said:\n“Since 1974 thousands of caring, selfless people have joined the Anthony Nolan register and thousands of lives have been saved as a result”.This Blood Cancer Awareness Month residents can be proud of all the lifesavers in your community. It’s wonderful to have the support of Argyll and Bute in achieving our goal of saving and improving the lives of people with blood cancer and blood disorders.”\nFor more information about the Community vs Blood Cancer campaign visit www.anthonynolan.org/communities\nAnthony Nolan uses its register to match potential stem cell donors to blood cancer patients in desperate need of a stem cell transplant.

They were not even acknowledged by BDUK when I was trying to secure an urgent meeting to salvage something from the wreckage to try to save that project.\nWhy, when I made an appointment to see the Minister himself about the crisis in GigaPlus Argyll, did he not turn up, with not so much as an apology or an offer to reschedule?”(Hansard)\nThe Minister didn’t offer an explanation at to why BDUK had ignored the phone calls and emails from the local MP seeking an urgent meeting to discuss this crucial constituency issue. Nor did he say why or apologise for not turning up to the agreed meeting with Mr. O’Hara, preferring instead to try and shift the blame on to the Scottish Government.”\nSpeaking immediately after the debate, Mr. O’Hara\n“It is completely unacceptable for a UK minister to try and deflect from his own bad manners and his own department’s incompetence by trying to implicate the Scottish government.”\nHe continued;\n“I thought the minister’s response was deeply disrespectful, not necessarily to me but to the people of Argyll & Bute and particularly the board of GigaPlus Argyll who have worked so hard for so long on this project and have done nothing to deserve being dismissed in such a high-handed and arrogant fashion by a UK government minister.”\nhttps://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2017-11-22a.379.0#g399.1",

They have been hit twice – when the state pension age was raised to 65 in line with men and then again when it was increased for men and women to 66 years – it’s a double whammy. It is utterly shameful that this Tory government have ducked their responsibility to the WASPI women.\nPensions are not a privilege but a contract and the UK government have broken that contract”.\nHe went on to say,\n“I was delighted to present this petition on behalf of all WASPI’s across Argyll and Bute affected by this and calling on the UK government to introduce measures that will mitigate the hardship that many of these women are now facing. I was joined by my SNP colleagues and many MPs from across the political spectrum so I hope this sends a clear signal to the government of the strength of support they have in parliament and its time that they put right this wrong.”",

Baroness Mone has taken leave of absence from the House Of Lords whilst the investigation is ongoing.\nOver the past year, there have been multiple reports showing firms linked to Tory figures secured lucrative contracts through the UK Tory government’s fast-track system.\nOther Tory figures linked to Covid contracts include disgraced former Health Secretary Matt Hancock helping to secure work for four companies, and Michael Gove referring a firm run by a Tory donor which went on to secure contracts worth nearly £50m.\nCommenting, the MP for Argyll & Bute said:\n“There is the stench of sleaze of beginning to engulf this government; a government which has many, many serious questions to answer on a its PPE procurement programme, which turned into something of get-rich-quick scheme for their politically connected pals and, it would appear, their colleagues as well.\nWhile doctors and nurses and other medical staff battled, unvaccinated through the worst of this pandemic, and as the public stood and cheered them in grateful thanks, it seems many people with connections to this Conservative government only saw the opportunity to make a quick buck.\nThe government have to explain if and how the unelected Baroness Mone managed to secure an eye watering £29 million of public money from her part in securing a contract fir PPE, as was reported recent in The Guardian\nIt is simply not good enough for the government to hide behind the excuses that PPE was needed urgently and that the usual procurement rules could not be properly enforced.\nIn the midst of the worst economic crisis in decades, the public have a right to know if £29 million of public money found its way to an offshore account owned by Baroness Mone and her family.\nI think most fair minded people would agree with me that it is obscene that people were able to make such vast profits from a government PPE contract while the country suffered through the pandemic.\nOf course perhaps the reason the government don’t want to talk about Baroness Mine’s Millions is that she is only the top of a very large iceberg of their politically connected pals who benefited like this.\nThat is why there should be an independent investigation into the full extent of this profiteering at a time of national crisis and those profiteers made to explain how they earned their new found fortune\n“While ordinary households struggle to make ends meet due to the cost of living crisis, the Tories are working hard to duck accountability and to make sure their pals – who they have stuffed into the House of Lords – are well looked after.\n“Rishi Sunak pledged when he took office that he would lead a government with ‘integrity’. It is now only right that he matches that rhetoric with action and suspends the whip from Baroness Mone and addresses the serious questions hanging over this entire shameful episode.”\nOn Thursday 8th December, as Cabinet Office Spokesperson, I led the SNP in speaking on this scandal and you can view my full contribution to the debate below.",
  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2017_02_20_mps-arctic-visit-with-royal-marines-doubles-as-impromptu-constituency-surgery/content_528.html": "Argyll & Bute MP Brendan O’Hara spent a few days in the Arctic Circle last week with the Royal Marine Commandos… and bumped into one of his Helensburgh constituents.\nBrendan, one of just 30 MPs and Peers to have been selected to join of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, flew out from RAF Brize Norton to Bardufoss Airbase in northern Norway to join the Royal Marines at their winter training base in Asegarden.\nHe met with Marines of all ranks and experienced at first-hand how they train in some of the harshest conditions on the planet.\nThe MP also learned the basics of cross-country skiing, how to build a survival shelter and fire in the forest, before spending a night under canvas in sub-zero temperatures with Marines’ Mountain Leaders.\nCommenting, Brendan said; “It was an unforgettable experience and one I am very privileged to have had. The Royal Marines, as I knew they would be, could not have been more welcoming and supportive. Their professionalism is exemplary and the level to which they train, simply outstanding.”\n“The benefit of this parliamentary scheme is that it gives MPs the opportunity to speak freely to service personnel, completely unsupervised, so everyone can talk freely and openly about what concerns they may have. As well as going out with the Mountain Leaders, I also spent time with the commanding officer, the chefs, the drivers and the medics.”\nAnd it was meeting the medics that provided the MP with the biggest surprise of the visit when he bumped into one of his constituents.\nBrendan said: “I was being shown round the medical facilities by a Marine with a Scottish accent. I asked where he was from and I was absolutely amazed when he replied, Helensburgh. It was a bit strange standing in the Arctic Circle with someone discussing how good Colquhoun Square is looking these days and debating what the best Chippie in the town is. It was without doubt, the most unusual constituency surgery I have had so far. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I promised him that when he gets back on leave I’d return his hospitality and take him for a coffee in town.”\nMr. O’Hara is the SNP frontbench spokesperson on Defence and the trip to the Arctic follows on from other fact-finding missions last year to military establishments in the Falklands and to the to the Army’s training facility, BATUS in Canada.\nBrendan: “It is hugely important that MPs see at first-hand what an outstanding job our armed forces personnel do and I cannot thank enough the Royal Marines for giving me the opportunity to join them at Asegarden. After almost two years on this scheme I have even greater respect for our armed forces and the training they endure to make sure they are ready for anything, whether entering a conflict, responding to a natural disaster or peacekeeping duties”.",
  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2017_12_08_closure-of-rbs-branch-in-inveraray/content_141.html": "I spent most of today in Inveraray talking to people and business owners about the proposed closure of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the last remaining bank in the town.\nI was also there to launch a formal Parliamentary petition which will run over Christmas and the New Year and which I will present to parliament, on the floor of the House of Commons early in 2018.\nI’d like to thank Donald Clark, proprietor of the George Hotel and Marian Pallister, the award winning journalist and author for being the first names on the petition.\nI visited many businesses in the town and I was delighted that every single business I visited took a pile of petition forms to have on their front counters in the run up to Christmas.\nIndeed such was the demand for forms that I ran out and will have to go back up to Inveraray to deliver more.\nI can honestly say I have never before experienced such widespread anger in a community and I can’t blame them.\nIf this ridiculous closure plan happens, then Inveraray, a internationally recognised tourism hot-spot, with a least three substantial hotels, numerous cafes, bars, gift shops, quality clothing retailers and a castle, will have absolutely no banking facilities whatsoever.\nI’m sure the levels of anger among the locals wasn’t help by an incredibly insensitive RBS advert in this morning’s Herald, with the slogan “it’s our job to respond to our customers’ changing lives”.\nThe truth is, rather than responding to their customers’ changing lives, it’s the RBS who are imposing change their customers’ lives.\nAs the motion I put down in Parliament yesterday says, this decision sends out all the wrong messages and undermines the work that has been and is being done by so many to help with the economic regeneration of Argyll & Bute.\nAnd I repeat the call I made for the majority state-owned RBS to better recognise its social responsibility and stop this brutal closure programme.\nI plan to be in Rothesay and Campbeltown in the near future to launch similar campaigns over the RBS decision to close the branches there too.",

  "https_brendanoharamp_scot/https_brendanoharamp_scot_2019_03_27_shocking-increase-in-foodbank-demand/content_396.html": "ALMOST half a million food parcels were handed out in Scotland between April 2017 and September 2018, with more than 7,000 distributed in Argyll and Bute, according to new statistics.\nThe shocking figures released this week reveal the extent of the food poverty crisis across the country as the number of food banks continues to grow and reliance on emergency aid increases.\nThe data, collected by the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) and A Menu for Change, gives a glimpse of the scale of assistance being provided by independently run food banks to people facing hunger in Argyll and Bute.\nOf the five independent organisations in the region participating in the study, 7,195 three-day food supply packages were given out in just 18 months.\nData had only previously existed for the Trussell Trust’s operations, which form the UK’s largest network of food banks.\nAcross Scotland, 84 independent food banks together distributed 221,977 emergency food packages between April 2017 and September 2018.\nOver the same time period the Trussell Trust distributed 258,606 food parcels, bringing the known Scottish total to 480,583.\nShock figures show Helensburgh food bank use is soaring.\nMary McGinley, chair of Helensburgh and Lomond Foodbank said: “We are deeply dismayed by the rising demand for emergency food aid we’re seeing locally.\n“We don’t want to be here; we would much rather see our political leaders address the causes of food insecurity through the introduction of the living wage, a better social security system and easier access to emergency welfare payments to allow people to buy their own food.”\nThe Advertiser reported in January that the number of people using the area’s food bank during the 2018 festive period had risen by more than 40 per cent compared to the previous year.\nThe food bank also announced earlier this year a pilot scheme offering free holiday lunch box meals for school children is to be trialled during the Easter break to try and address food poverty in young children and families.\nHelensburgh food bank’s plea over holiday meals scheme.\nSabine Goodwin, IFAN coordinator who led the research, said: “These statistics are deeply troubling and provide yet more evidence of the growing number of people in Argyll and Bute and across Scotland who are unable to put food on the table.\n“They also demonstrate the enormous collective effort of independent food bank volunteers and staff who are doing all they can to try to prevent people in their communities from facing hunger.\n“Of course, we and they all know the long-term solution to hunger isn’t giving out food; it’s raising income.\n“People should be helped financially well before they find themselves having to turn to a food bank as a last resort.”\nResearch shows that problems with the UK-wide benefits system is one of the key drivers of food bank use, but Scottish campaigners from A Menu for Change say that the Scottish Government must urgently use its new social security powers to help prevent people in Scotland from being pushed further into poverty.\nScottish ministers have promised to bring in a new income supplement by 2022 to help Scotland’s poorest families, but campaigners say people facing hardship can’t afford to wait three years for this extra support.\nLast week, Argyll and Bute SNP MP Brendan O’Hara revealed the story of a Helensburgh family who approached his office in the town starving and desperate after “ticking the wrong box” on a Universal Credit application form.\nStarving’ Helensburgh family let down by Universal Credit, says MP.\nMr O’Hara said: “This problem is founded on political choice and penalises our most vulnerable citizens.\n“Compare and contrast with the ‘dignity and respect’ agenda behind the Scottish social security system.\n“What happened to this young family was a direct result of UK government policy, a policy which is Dickensian, leaving some folk literally starving.\n“The levels of inequality across the town are astonishing, ranging from great personal wealth to enormous levels of poverty.”\nCommunities Secretary Aileen Campbell MSP said: “I absolutely agree that it is unacceptable that people are having to rely on charity to eat in a country as prosperous as Scotland and that this government has to spend £125 million to mitigate against the worst impacts of UK Government benefit cuts.\n“We will also provide £3.5 million in 2019-20 for our Fair Food Fund to support organisations responding to food insecurity.\n“Significant work is being taken forward on our low-income supplement and an update on this will be provided to parliament by June.\n“Scotland is taking concrete action to eradicate child poverty – we are the only country in the UK with legal targets to do so, all while continuing to mitigate the welfare cuts and failed policies of the UK Government which are set to reduce social security spending in Scotland by £3.7 billion in 2020-21.”\nA Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: “The reasons for people using food banks are complex. Meanwhile for those who need extra support, the UK Government spends over £90 billion a year on support for those who need it, including those who are on a low income.\n“In addition, Scotland has significant welfare powers and can top-up existing benefits, pay discretionary payments and create entirely new benefits altogether.”"
