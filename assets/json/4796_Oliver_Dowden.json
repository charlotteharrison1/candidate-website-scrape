We massively rely on these transport links, both to get around the local area and to reach London, which is crucial for the many local residents who commute there every day.\nI have secured major improvements to our railways, including:\n- Extending Oyster to Potters Bar and Radlett;\n- Overhauling and upgrading Borehamwood station;\n- New modern carriages on Thameslink and Great Northern;\n- Delivering proper compensation for everyone hit by the 2018 timetable chaos;\n- Secured funding for improving facilities at Bushey Station.\nI continue to campaign for further improvements, including pressing Govia Thameslink for more regular services in our area and consistently making the case for improved facilities at Radlett Station.\nI have also worked to preserve vital local bus services in Bushey and Potters Bar, including the 84B service. Alongside this I will be pushing Hertfordshire County Council to make sure our roads are maintained, and potholes fixed.\nI will continue to listen closely to my constituents’ view on this and work hard to secure further vital upgrades.",

It continues to be a privilege and honour to be the MP for Hertsmere. Thank you to everyone who put their faith in me over the past decade.\nI’m passionate about preserving what makes Hertsmere such a special place to live, and I will continue to work locally and nationally to promote my key priorities.\nWe are lucky to have the best of both worlds in Bushey, where we can enjoy the open countryside and have easy access to London. Since I was first elected in 2015, it has been a key priority of mine to protect our precious green open spaces. Over the years, I have joined residents in campaigns on Bushey Country Club, Harts Farm and Caldecote Farm. I have also helped secure the future of Aldenham Reservoir.\nHertsmere’s diversity is a great strength. I’m proud to represent one of the UK’s largest Jewish communities and have had the pleasure of making great friends and enjoying a variety of events, including Mitzvah days, Friday night dinners and Menorah lightings.\nI’ve also had an excellent time celebrating a range of festivals where I’ve been warmly welcomed at the Hare Krishna Temple at Bhaktivedanta Manor, St Peter’s Church and SRMD London Spiritual Centre.\nI have campaigned tirelessly as Hertsmere’s MP to improve our local transport. I am proud to have successfully secured funding to improve facilities at Bushey Station and deliver proper compensation for everyone hit by the 2018 timetable chaos.\nI am always very pleased to visit the many excellent schools we have in the area. I will continue to champion them as have done since I was elected. This includes raising concerns about the government’s VAT hike on schools St Hilda’s Prep and Immanuel College Prep.\nThank you again for giving me the honour of representing you. I will work to serve everyone in Hertsmere, regardless of how you voted, to the best of my abilities, as I always do.",

So, can I urge the Minister to avoid engaging in political point-scoring and instead join me in sending a very clear message, from both sides of this House, that our expectation is that the police should be focused on solving real crimes and stay out of legitimate free expression and democratic debate?”\nSir Oliver also discussed this issue in interviews with Talk TV, LBC, Times Radio and GB News.",

The discussions focused on the positive impact that the 3 Up initiative would have on the clubs and players who work tirelessly to secure promotion, but also touched on broader issues within the football landscape, notably the Football Governance Bill.\nManager Luke Garrard, his staff, and players then enjoyed a quick chat with Sir Oliver on the training pitch, before embarking on a whistle-stop tour of the ever-improving facility.\nSir Oliver said: “This initiative, backed by all 72 National League clubs, is a crucial step towards ensuring fairness and meritocracy in the English football pyramid. The current system, which allows only two promotion places, creates a significant bottleneck for ambitious clubs striving to progress.”\nThe National League has demonstrated its financial stability and alignment with the EFL’s regulatory framework, making this the right time to enact this change. After discussing this in depth with officials at Boreham Wood FC, it is clear that the demand for change is strong.\nI have therefore urged the EFL Board to prioritise this issue and to schedule a vote on three promotions at the earliest opportunity.”\nSir Oliver added: “Clubs like Boreham Wood are the heartbeat of their communities and play a vital role both on and off the pitch. It’s clear from fans, players and clubs alike that the current system of only two promotion spots into the EFL is outdated and unfair.”\nFollowing Truro City’s recent victory of the National League South title, Boreham Wood FC will now compete for promotion to the EFL League Two in the play-off rounds. They will face Torquay United away in the Play Off Semi Final on Saturday 3 May at 15:00pm.\nFor more information on the 3UP campaign and to get involved, visit www.thenationalleague.org.uk or follow @TheVanaramaNL on social media.",

This offered an opportunity to honour Holocaust victims and the survivors and pledge to combat antisemitism today.\nThis year will be particularly significant as it marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The anniversary reminds us of the continued need for vigilance, commemoration and education.\n80 years on from the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, and in the months since the 7 October attacks, antisemitism has again reared its head in the UK and globally. As your local MP I remain firmly committed to fighting antisemitism and hate of any kind.\nI recently spoke in a debate in the House of Commons on the ceasefire deal in the Middle East. Every Friday since 7 October, many of us have gathered with a simple message: Bring Them Home.

  "http_www_oliverdowden_com_/http_www_oliverdowden_com_about-hertsmere/content_19.html": "Hertsmere is a beautiful corner of England. Situated just outside London, it enjoys all the benefits of easy access to the capital for work and leisure due to fast rail links but also large amounts of green space.\nThe main towns and villages are:\nBorehamwood – Borehamwood is probably best known for the part it played in the history of British cinema. It is home to the famous Elstree film studios where Star Wars, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Indiana Jones and Bohemian Rhapsody were filmed, as well as BBC Elstree where East Enders and Strictly Come Dancing are currently filmed. The Elstree Way corridor houses many world class businesses. Borehamwood is also home to the council's civic offices.\nPotters Bar – The name Potters Bar is thought to derive from evidence of a Roman pottery believed to have operated in the area. The Potters Bar of today owes its growth and development to the coming of the railways. During the 1920s and 30s, when the town became a favourite home for commuters, the population trebled. As a result of this rapid suburban growth, the town has two shopping areas centred on Darkes Lane and High Street. It is a lively modern town with a strong and active community.\nRadlett – The origins of Radlett can be traced back further than the 18th century and there is evidence of settlement from Roman times. Today Radlett is an attractive urban village that has held on to its character and charm. Clustered along the line of Watling Street are a good range of shops, pubs and restaurants. Radlett’s excellent road and rail links combined with its proximity to London means it had become a popular, charming residential area.\nBushey – With a history dating back thousands of years, Bushey is an ancient settlement with links to the Romans. Bushey has a village atmosphere and the main part, near the ancient Church of St James’ and the village pond is a conservation area with buildings dating back to the 18th century. The area’s picturesque qualities were recognized in the last century when many eminent artists worked and lived there. Today Bushey is a mix of antique shops, restaurants, pubs and general stores that are clustered along the High Street.\nShenley – The history of Shenley dates back almost a thousand years to its appearance in the Domesday Book in 1068. Shenley Park is at the heart of the village and includes an orchard and an amazing 2 acre landscaped Walled Garden with an amphitheatre. These are open to the public and play host to a number of events throughout the year. Shenley is also home to the training ground of Arsenal Football Club, which boasts state of the art facilities, and was opened in 2000.\nThe constituency was created in 1983 and has been represented by Lord (Cecil) Parkinson and James Clappison.",

I have continuously opposed this policy and raised it at the highest level, asking the Prime Minister to reconsider its impact.

The pandemic undoubtedly had an impact on TfL’s finances but ultimately the difficulty it faces stems from the pre-existing poor condition of TfL’s finances, as a result of decisions taken since 2016 by the Mayor.\nIt is unacceptable that Hertsmere residents, who do not live in London, should pay extra to travel towards London as a result of the Mayor’s poor financial decisions.\nI have always been clear that I oppose the expansion of ULEZ to Hertsmere’s borders, campaigning against it since these proposals were first announced.\nI have spoken with many of my constituents, who have explained how these extra charges will put additional financial strain on their families during what is already a difficult period. This is particularly true of constituents who commute into London or drive to vital appointments at hospitals such as The Royal Free, which will fall within the expanded zone.\nThe ULEZ currently runs up to the North and South Circular roads, but residents in Hertsmere will be hugely affected as Transport for London propose to expand the zone to cover the whole of Greater London, reaching Hertsmere’s borders.\nThis will affect residents travelling into London from Bushey Heath towards Stanmore, and at the A41 Elstree Hill Roundabout and A1 Stirling Corner Roundabout, to name some examples.\nI will continue to make my serious concerns clear to the Transport Secretary, as well as to both TfL and The Mayor of London.\nLet me reassure residents I am totally opposed to an extension of the ULEZ to the perimeters of Hertsmere, and I will continue to fight against this.",

Having worked closely with the local NHS as MP for Hertsmere, I know how important its services and improving its services are to the local community.\nLast month I visited Watford General Hospital to receive an update on their redevelopment plans, as part of the government’s biggest hospital building programme in a generation.\nIt was great to speak to hospital staff about the progress of the redevelopment, a timeline of completion and see a model of what the site will look like. Watford General is being redeveloped as part of the government’s plan to build 40 new hospitals by 2030, backed by £3.7 billion of funding from the government.\nThe site will provide much needed services for our community in one place locally. It will also be crucial in delivering state-of-the-art facilities that they deserve.\nWhile I was at Watford General, it was also fantastic to see first-hand the innovative robotic programme in the Robotics Department. I was able to try out one of the robotic machines myself, practicing on a trainer simulator.\nThis game changing equipment enables surgeons to carry out robotic-assisted surgeries on patients suffering from colorectal, gynaecological and urology issues.\nNot only does this innovate machinery reduce post-operative pain, but also increase recovery time, leading to earlier discharge from hospital. A real success.\nI will continue to work with local and national governments to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to serve our growing community.",
  "http_www_oliverdowden_com_/http_www_oliverdowden_com_campaigns_defending-our-countryside/content_18.html": "One of the great pleasures of living in our part of Hertfordshire is the countryside we have right on our doorstep. I grew up enjoying the green area our area and love the space and freedom it provides. It makes our towns and villages distinct and special places to live. We of course need more homes for our children and grandchildren, but this must not be at the expense of what makes our area special.\nNationally, I have championed the maintenance of our green open spaces. The Government have reversed reforms that I lobbied for previously, in particular reinstating top-down targets and redesignating Green Belt land, which may make it easier to build on our green spaces. Locally, I have joined campaigns against inappropriate and unsustainable developments and I will continue to oppose any changes which do not protect the Green Belt.\nThe council's latest Local Plan consultation period has now closed. They are now reviewing submissions received and will reopen public consultation of the Local Plan before it is submitted to the government. I urge constituents to engage with the council’s consultation on the new local plan, and I have stressed to councillors the importance of protecting our green spaces as they work to put a new plan in place.\nI have worked closely with STRIFE to do all I can to resist the construction of the Radlett Rail Freight Terminal that would clog our roads, blight our countryside and put further pressure on the Thameslink line. I've championed the maintenance and re-planting of precious trees across the Borough. In Bushey, I was proud to work with all parties to help secure the future of Aldenham Reservoir. In Radlett, I expressed my serious concerns about the size and scope of a proposed solar farm, which was thankfully blocked by the previous government.\nIt is a key priority of mine to protect our precious green open spaces for generations to come.",
  "http_www_oliverdowden_com_/http_www_oliverdowden_com_news_olivers-column-my-news-march-2025/content_29.html": "I have long campaigned for improved local medical facilities and hospitals serving Bushey/ Radlett.\nI know how important Watford General Hospital is to our community, it is used by many local residents, including me – my son was born there. However, I know that constituents have written to me about the need to bring the facilities up to date for modern healthcare.\nIt was therefore fantastic that the previous government announced Watford General Hospital would receive much needed government funding, with a fully funded new hospital built by 2030. This was part of the New Hospital Programme, the biggest hospital building programme in a generation to deliver world-class healthcare services.\nHaving worked closely with the local NHS as MP for Hertsmere, I know how important improving Watford General’s services are to the community. As recently as last year, I visited the hospital to receive an update on the progress of the redevelopment, a timeline of completion and see a model of what the site will look like.\nIn December I, along with MPs from surrounding constituencies, wrote to the Health Secretary to ask the government to prioritise the redevelopment at Watford. In addition to this, I asked Written Parliamentary Questions and made representations on behalf of concerned constituents about the hospital’s facilities.\nI am extremely disappointed to learn that the government have delayed the redevelopment of Watford General. Their recent announcement will mean that construction of the main hospital building will not start until at least 2032 and potentially as late as 2034.\nLocal people deserve these state-of-the-art facilities sooner, whether they are patients or staff. I will continue to work with the local NHS and scrutinise the government to ensure we have the infrastructure in place as soon as possible to serve our community.\nI hope in the future we will be able to have a hospital that serves ourselves, our parents and our children.",
  "http_www_oliverdowden_com_/http_www_oliverdowden_com_campaigns_strong-infrastructure/content_20.html": "As our towns and villages continue to grow, particularly with a new Local Plan being developed, we must get the infrastructure to go with it. During discussions about the Local Plan, I emphasised the importance of providing infrastructure to go with any new houses and prevent strain on existing services. In addition to education and transport, I continue to campaign for improved local medical facilities, such as re-developing key hospitals serving Bushey and Radlett, a new health hub in Borehamwood and backing community pharmacies.\nI know how important Watford General Hospital is to our community, it is used by many local residents, including me – my son was born there. It was fantastic that the previous government announced Watford General Hospital would receive much needed government funding, with a fully funded new hospital built by 2030. However, I was extremely disappointed to learn that the government have delayed the redevelopment of Watford General, with construction not starting until at least 2032. I will continue to work with the local NHS and scrutinise the government to ensure we have the infrastructure in place as soon as possible to serve our community.\nGiven the government’s regrettable decision not to fund Watford General Hospital’s refurbishment in this Parliament, there is an even greater need for new healthcare facilities in Borehamwood. I have raised this with the Secretary of State for Health and other relevant authorities to make the case for these facilities.\nResidents need improved access to treatment and the NHS needs pressure alleviated, which is why I am proud to back community pharmacies. This continues on the previous government’s Pharmacy First programme, which expanded pharmacies’ capacity to treat common conditions, such as shingles and sinusitis.\nI continue to hold local and national governments to account to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to serve our growing community.",
  "http_www_oliverdowden_com_/http_www_oliverdowden_com_news_oliver-hears-potters-bar-residents-planning-concerns/content_14.html": "Sir Oliver recently met with a group of Potters Bar residents, organised as the Potters Bar Special Interest Group, to discuss their views on planning proposals in the area.\nResidents highlighted two proposed developments in close proximity to one another: the construction of a Data Centre on a plot east of South Mimms, and the construction of 900 houses on a plot south of Potters Bar, both of which are on Green Belt land. They outlined a number of issues, including loss of green space, impact on local transport links and infrastructure, noise pollution, aesthetic concerns, and loss of agricultural land, as well as voicing broader concerns about Labour’s national planning reforms.\nSir Oliver said: “Having grown up enjoying the green spaces in our area, I know as well as anyone how important it is to secure long-term protections for them. That is why, since I was first elected in 2015, I have worked tirelessly to protect our local countryside and will continue to oppose Labour's destructive reforms at every opportunity.\nHertsmere Borough Council’s decision to grant consent for the proposed data centre will be difficult to overturn, particularly given both the Government’s reclassification of data centres as Critical National Infrastructure and the support for the development from the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Angela Rayner.\nHowever, the council has not yet made a decision on the application for 900 houses. I oppose this development and remain clear that permission should not be granted. We should not be building on Green Belt land unless there are exceptional circumstances which, in this instance, I do not believe to exist. I have raised this with Hertsmere Borough Council and have also sent a mailout to local residents, making clear my thoughts and encouraging them to submit their own views.\nWhile individual planning applications are solely a matter for the local authority and are not an area in which I have any formal influence, I will always fight to protect our local countryside and will continue to advocate for the protection of green spaces.”",

Alternative services will be available through Post Offices and nearby Santander branches in Edgware and Barnet. I will also be pushing for the establishment of a local Banking Hub and Community Bankers.”\nIf any constituents would like to raise concerns about this situation, then please do get in contact via [email protected].",
