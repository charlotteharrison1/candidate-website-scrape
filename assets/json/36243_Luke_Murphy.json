Since 2016, I have worked at the the UK’s leading progressive think tank. My work there has been crucial to putting tackling climate change and fixing our broken housing market at the heart of political and public debate.\nI’ve also been a local councillor in South London, worked on campaigns on issues from the Living Wage to debt justice for developing countries, and I am also an experienced media performer and contributor. I’ve appeared on national broadcast media, including Newsnight, BBC and ITV News and BBC Radio 4 Today Programme and I’ve written for a range of publications including the Guardian, the Times and the Independent, and for other outlets including the New Statesman. I’m also a proud trade unionist.\nAfter fourteen years of Conservative failure, political chaos and underachievement nationally on the economy and public services, and two decades of Maria Miller locally, I’m proud to have been elected as Basingstoke’s first-ever Labour MP.\nI will work so that Basingstoke, and everyone who lives here, is able to fulfil their full potential. Labour will restore Britain’s pride and purpose and move on from the division and chaos of the Tory years.\nI host regular support surgeries, coffee mornings and community events across Basingstoke. If you’d like to book an appointment or need my support, contact my office at [email protected] or 01256 587093.\nBasingstoke is a town to be proud of. Like many people, I’ve chosen to live here, but we all know things can be better. That’s why I believe it’s time for change.\nFrom the NHS to endless potholes in our roads, some of the basic things we felt we could rely on are broken. All I ask is for the opportunity to serve, and help secure a better future for Basingstoke.\nAfter 14 years of broken promises from the Conservatives locally and nationally, trust in politicians and the ability of politics and government to improve things is at an all time low. I want to rebuild that trust, that means only making promises I can keep.\nI’ve worked in the private sector and as a charity campaigner locally and nationally, with a track record of getting things done; whether helping to change the law to protect consumers from rip off fees, or serving as a local councillor delivering for residents.\nI will be a dedicated representative locally, and a strong voice for Basingstoke nationally.\nWe need the support of Basingstoke to make change under our new government.\nPeople across Basingstoke are finding it impossible to get a GP appointment, register with a dentist, or get an operation when they need one. As your MP, I promise to get our local NHS back on its feet - ensuring residents can see a GP or dentist when they need to. I’ll champion bringing a new hospital to Basingstoke, and I promise to be transparent and honest as the project progresses.\nI've successfully campaigned to raise wages and I helped to develop the policy to cap energy bills. I know that high inflation and rising food, fuel and mortgage costs are hurting people. I’ll use my experience to make the case for strong economic policy that benefits local people. Unlike this government, I want you to keep as much of your hard-earned money as possible. That’s what I’ll fight for from day one.\nMy parents left school when they were 15 - but they worked hard to ensure I got the opportunities they didn’t. But for too many, the idea the next generation will do better than the last is no longer possible. I’ll make sure our schools get the resources they need, and a Labour government will invest in over 6,500 new teachers. Labour will improve the quality and availability of childcare.\nThe Top of Town has a special place in Basingstoke, but under the Conservatives it has become run down and half-empty. Too many small businesses have had to close their doors. Labour has a plan to revitalise our high streets by reforming business rates and giving new powers to communities to bring empty units back into use. I'll work with a Labour government and the council to revive our high street.\nThe government have let you down on crime by hollowing out policing - over 90 per cent of crimes now go unsolved. That means more criminals being let off and more victims being let down. As your MP, I'll be tough on crime and anti-social behaviour, bring the police together with local communities, guarantee town centre patrols, and fight to bring neighbourhood policing back to our streets.\nWe need a national home upgrade to make every home a warm one, cut energy bills, tackle climate change, and ensure energy security. I’ve led the campaign to deliver it.\nEveryone deserves a secure, affordable, and warm home, but our housing market is broken. I’ve been campaigning to fix it by building council homes, regulating private renting, and taking on big developers.\nThe climate crisis threatens our economy, environment, and our children’s’ futures. But in the fight for a cleaner world we must deliver equality and a fairer economy at the same time.\nI’ve campaigned against the closure of railway station ticket offices, which is an unfair and false economy that is being imposed by the Conservative Government at Westminster.\nThe Government is giving passengers a strong voice with a new watchdog to tackle their biggest concerns. It’s fundamentally about making our railways more reliable, improving services, and giving passengers a system they can actually trust - because that’s what real change looks…\nThank you, Costello, for having me! It’s always a pleasure to hear from students and talk about my work as their MP. Very impressed with how engaged you all were - interesting conversations about the NHS, support for youth mental health, international politics and funding for the…\nGood luck Aaron with the new season and congrats! https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/news/24930133.basingstokes-aaron-morgan-selected-drive-team-brit/\nTo mark #NAW2025 last week I visited Basingstoke College of Technology to meet carpentry and joiner apprentices...\n✅ Unlocking tens of thousands of apprenticeships\n✅ Cutting admin for providers\n✅ Creating a one-stop shop apprenticeship app\n✅ Getting Britain building again…\n✨ Last Friday, we welcomed local MP Luke Murphy! ✨\nHe came and spoke to our students about apprenticeships, in honour of National Apprenticeship Week. It was an afternoon of meaningful conversation and learning ✏️💬 .\nThanks for visiting @LukeMLabour!\n#BCoT #Apprenticeships\nFixing the NHS won’t happen overnight, but the Government is already making real progress. We’re funding 40,000 extra appointments, scans, and operations every week, investing £25.6 billion over two years, and recruiting 8,500 new mental health workers, including specialists for…\nLove hearing about apprenticeship successes - well done Jack who is an great example of the progression that can be achieved through this route!\nhttps://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/news/24930036.swr-basingstoke-worker-celebrates-success-apprenticeship/\n@LukeMLabour @BstokeGangShow @AnvilArts A privilege to invite @LukeMLabour to Basingstoke Gang Show at The Haymarket Theatre to experience our 45th anniversary show.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.\nWe keep our privacy policy under regular review and will notify you of any substantive changes. Any revisions to our privacy policy can be reviewed on this website.\nThis website may include links to third-party websites, platforms, plug-ins and applications.

Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.\nRight of access\nYou may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request“).\nWe follow the ICO’s “Subject Access Code of Practice” when dealing with requests for access to personal data. You can read this code by visiting https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2014223/subject-access-code-of-practice.pdf.\nPlease note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to or contain your personal data.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to rectification and erasure\nYou may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten“).\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to restrict processing\nWhere we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this privacy policy which explain how and why we use your information), you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.\nYou may also ask us to stop processing your personal data: (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us to verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; or (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nPlease note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to portability\nWhere you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.\nBecause of the kind of the nature of our work do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party, we are happy to consider such requests in good faith.\nYour right to stop receiving communications\nAs noted above, where we send you email marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).\nAlternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by contacting us at [email protected] and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.\nYour right to object to automated decision making and profiling\nYou have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.\nExercising your rights\nWhen you write to us making a request to exercise your rights, we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nIt will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information, then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case, we will tell you).\nYou will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (1) month. However, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the supervisory body authorised by the Data Protection Act 2018 to regulate the handling of personal data within the United Kingdom.\nThe contact details for the ICO are:\nLast updated: 25/08/2023\nAsk me a question, offer your support, and keep up to date with my work as your local Labour MP.\nPromoted by Andy McCormick on behalf of Luke Murphy, both at 47 Winchester Street, Basingstoke, RG21 7EF\n[email protected]\nPrivacy Policy"
