This could be a friend, family member or neighbour, who due to illness, disability, mental ill health or an addiction could not cope without their support. Two out of three people will become a carer at some point in their lives, but research shows that over half of unpaid carers looking after a family member or friend take a year or more to realise that they are carers.\nThere are thousands of carers in the country who are missing out on these rights, because they are unaware of their legal rights and what they’re entitled to in terms of support. National Carers Rights Day helps carers recognise and understand their rights and raise awareness about the support available to them.\nAccording to the latest census, there are 7,826 carers in Sussex Weald. Nusrat continues working with local charity Care for the Carers, who provide support for unpaid cares across Sussex Weald and East Sussex, including free practical and emotional advice, one-to-one crisis help, training, wellbeing groups and much more.\nTo find out more about the support available and carer rights, get in touch with Care for the Carers on 01323 732390 or visit www.cftc.org.uk.\nNusrat Ghani said: “Carers play a vital role in ensuring that so many people across Sussex Weald have better quality of life and personalised end of life care. The wellbeing of carers is all too often forgotten, and Carers Rights Day is an important campaign to raise awareness about the legal rights and support available. I’m pleased to be supporting Care for the Carers who provide free wraparound service for carers in Sussex Weald and across East Sussex to ensure that no one is left to care alone. I am hugely grateful for the amazing work that Sussex Weald carers do everyday, and I continue working with our fantastic local charities, organisations and care homes to ensure that our Sussex Weald carers are better recognised and supported.”",

Once again, thank you so much for your ongoing support.”\nJohn, 📍Crowborough\n“I just wanted to thank you for your quick response last week. I appreciate your time and the stance you have taken to help my business. I would also like to congratulate you on your excellent work in helping the cause of the Uyghurs. Politicians in the west need to stand up for human rights wherever there is abuse regardless of the power or wealth of the aggressors and you have certainly made your mark on this most important issue.”\nJane, 📍Crowborough\n“Thank you very much for following up on my previous letter. All the best for your ongoing hard work.”\nJohn, 📍Horam\n“Just to congratulate you on your resolute stand for the Uighurs.

  "https_www_nusghani_org_uk_/https_www_nusghani_org_uk_campaigns_result-securing-return-rehearsals-amateur-choirs-during-covid-19/content_9.html": "I recently convened a virtual meeting with representatives of various amateur choirs from across Wealden and East Sussex to listen to their concerns regarding the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on restarting their activities.\nMembers and Leaders from Ashdown Singers, Hailsham Voices, Fletching Singers, Crowborough Choral Society, Mayfield Festival Choir, Penshurst Choral Society, Heathfield Choral Society and South Downs Singers were present at the meeting, representing the thousands of musicians across Wealden impacted by these restrictions.\nAccording to Government guidelines, ‘amateur’ choirs were excluded from the easing of restrictions on the culture sector as part of Step 3 of the roadmap and only allowed to meet in groups of no more than six indoors.\nI am pleased that following my representations, the Government issued a clarification of the guidance, allowing ‘amateur’ choirs to resume activities for commercial purposes. This is excellent news for our fabulous choral groups in Wealden, which are key to our local communities and raise valuable contributions to our local charities through their performances. I stressed in my letter that the catch-all label 'amateur' not only failed to understand how these groups function, but also meant that thousands of local professionals were left without income. We have a tremendously successful vaccination programme, with more than half of UK population now fully protected and I trust that many other precautions have been taken to ensure choir activities resume in a Covid-safe way. I am pleased that I secured this change for Mayfield Festival Choir and other Wealden ensembles.\nKelly Richards, Chair of South Downs Singers, said: \"I would just like to thank you on behalf of our choir for all you help, advice, and support in getting us back on the road to performing. It is so refreshing to see an MP complete in a strong fashion what they say they will do. Again so many thanks.\"\nJane Bolger, Chair of Mayfield Festival Choir, said: “Thank you so much for listening to our explanations and for the way you responded when I and other local choral societies asked for your help seeking clarification from the DCMS. It was so encouraging to have your interest and support and to read the letter you sent to the secretaries of state as a result of our discussions. We were delighted when the DCMS responded saying that \"we would remind you that limits do not apply to activity taking place for work or commercial activity\". Because we sell tickets for our concerts, and employ professional musicians, choral societies come under the heading of work or commercial activity. We are resuming our in-person (distanced, masked, cleansed) rehearsals with joy this week.\"\nFurther information about the virtual meeting can be found here."
