But I was astounded to hear the Chancellor say, the “Budget is not the time to set detailed fiscal rules, with precise targets and dates to achieve them by.” WTF? That’s exactly what a budget’s for.\nMy first priority is to deliver for the people of the North of Tyne. That requires finding the win-win with all partners, including central government. I take a “hate the sin, love the sinner” attitude – by pointing out better alternatives. Cheap shots and personal attacks help no one.\nBut could you imagine a corporate finance director proposing a budget and saying, “This budget is not intended to include precise facts or timescales”? If it’s not the Chancellor’s job to be on top of the public finances, then whose is it?\nMr Sunak’s budget has drawn criticism from across the spectrum. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says tax and spending plans don’t add up, and his plans don’t look deliverable. Thatcherite think tank the Centre for Policy Studies says it won’t create long term growth. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (not known to be a hotbed of revolutionaries) says it has a big hole where the creation of green jobs should have been. I say keyworkers need a pay rise, not a tax rise.\nPretty much every second paragraph in that speech mentioned ‘levelling up’. But there was nothing to level up Tyneside, or Wearside, or Northumberland. The people of Blyth Valley must feel doubly let down. It’s the Inverse Care Law of politics – the more a government talks about something, the less it actually does.\nLast summer, the government asked me to develop an economic recovery plan. It was a real collaboration between all seven of our local authorities, local businesses, our universities, and combined authorities north and south of the Tyne.\nIt’s a costed plan to create 55,000 jobs. Skilled, well-paid jobs in high-tech and green industries, with the training programmes so local people can fill these jobs. We submitted it as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in the Autumn. They cancelled that. They said it would inform the budget, but they’ve ignored it again.\nThese jobs would be stimulating and well-paid. The extra spending power would boost our wider economy. The payroll taxes alone (PAYE, employee’s and employer’s national insurance) would pay for the plan in just a few years. I have to ask: why doesn’t the Chancellor want to create those 55,000 jobs in the North East?\nInstead we’re on the same merry-go-round we’ve been on for the past forty years. Governments announce “initiatives” and “funds” that are available to the whole country, and fail to address the needs of our region.\nLocal Authorities and Combined Authorities have to bid to get the funds they need to deliver essential services like transport improvements. It costs a fortune and takes ages. If you do win, the money has to be spent in a disjointed hurry without any strategic coherence.\nWhen we were asked to submit the recovery plan last year, it finally looked like the government recognised the importance of the role of Combined Authorities. We’re the only organisations who can join everything up – transport, economic recovery, housing, carbon reduction, and skills. We can focus on what works here, not the one-size-fits-all that comes out of Whitehall and Westminster.\nWhenever governments (not just this one) spot a problem, their knee-jerk reaction is to set up another Commission or quango to fix it. It takes months to go through each stage. Define the remit. Recruit the staff. Sign-off the systems, governance and assurance frameworks. As Sir Humphrey said, “Months of fruitful work!”\nMayoral Combined Authorities are already here. Already set up. Already fully functional and delivering thousands of real jobs. But you wouldn’t know that from the Chancellor’s speech.\nWe can and we will be submitting bids. But this Budget is a wake-up call to anyone who thinks devolution and economic recovery can be separated. Until decisions about our region are made in our region, we’ll always be waiting for the crumbs from the king’s table.\nI had low expectations of this Budget, and the Chancellor failed to meet them.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 8.3.21",

In the spirit of fairness, it was his sub-editor who put in Newcastle; Aditya gets that the North of Tyne includes Northumberland and North Tyneside.\nOne thing that he highlights is some of the challenges we face at convincing disillusioned traditional Labour voters that this is an election worth supporting, but my policies stand up to scrutiny and can transform the North of Tyne in a way we’ve never seen before.\nYou can be part of that. We can all be part of creating prosperity that cares about people, the work they do and the environment we live in.\nI only have one problem with the article – it’s a beard. A proper beard.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_there-is-strength-in-a-union/content_273.html": "There is Strength in a Union\nFebruary 19, 2023\nI hope you had a good weekend – they’re great aren’t they? 2 days off every week to spend time with family and friends. Watch the footy maybe, or knit a jumper, hit the bars, catch a film, bake a cake, run up a hill, or whatever you’re into. I know it’s a bit different if you are in hospitality (shout out to the Monday weekenders) or work shifts, but you get my point.\nIt wasn’t always like this. It was the trade unions that lobbied for a two-day break in the 19th Century, extending the existing rest day of Sunday. But Unions have done so much more to bring about better working conditions. Reduced hours. Minimum pay. Paid annual leave. Not to mention life-saving health and safety measures at work.\nLast week was ‘heart unions’ week. A brilliant initiative from the TUC to celebrate the work of unions and encourage more people to get involved. So, if you haven’t already, I urge you to join a union. Who knows, you might want to campaign for a 3-day weekend! I’m sure there’ll be a few in black and white that would fancy next Monday off. Personally, I’ve got everything crossed for Eddie Howe and his brilliant team – let’s see them bring it home.\nOn Friday I was speaking alongside Mick Lynch and Kate Osborne at a dinner and fundraiser I hosted to support the Durham Miners’ Gala – the world’s greatest celebration of trade union collectivism, international solidarity and working-class culture. A truly unique event that is very close to my heart.\nNow cast your mind back to Saturday 12th July 1980. Olivia Newton John and ELO are top of the charts with Xanadu. Margaret Thatcher has taken power. Ronald Reagan is riding high in the polls. And a 10-year-old Jamie Driscoll is at his first ever Durham Miners’ Gala, with his Mam. She was a NALGO union official at the time, and I remember her telling me to look up at the balcony of the County Hotel, and who was there, waving at the crowds below? I have absolutely no idea. I was far too young to recognise them. But I do remember the sense of camaraderie and pride amongst those crowds. And that unforgettable feeling when you hear the colliery brass band strike up for the first time.\nThat sense of working-class solidarity has been on show this past year. Working people won’t accept below inflation pay deals, because that’s still a pay cut. They can’t. We’re facing the biggest fall in living standards since records began. Enough is enough.\nThe money’s there to pay people. Government has paid train companies £340 million in compensation for strikes. They could have settled the dispute for that!\nThere has been no pay restraint for the bankers and the big energy companies like Shell and BP. They’ve been laughing all the way to the bank. Nurses, paramedics, teachers, posties, rail staff, university workers, and others – they are only asking for enough money to live on. I don’t recall seeing nurses commuting to their wards via private jet.\nOn Saturday I marched alongside striking trade union members and spoke at a demonstration at the Monument. We were taking to the streets to remind the government that poverty is not a willing choice for people whose wages are falling behind inflation, whose bills are spiralling out of control, who’ve seen the price of their weekly shop ratchet up every time they go to the supermarket.\nBut it is a choice for the government to do something about it.\nAs Mayor of the North of Tyne Combined Authority, we’re creating 4,766 well-paid jobs. We’re investing in child poverty prevention, working through local schools – poverty proofing the school day and offering welfare advice to parents at the school gates. But we need the Westminster government to step up and do more to support those struggling with the most basic of human needs – food, warmth and shelter.\nMy mission is the make the North East the best place to live, work and play in – but I can’t do it on my own. So, let’s do it together. After all, there is strength in a union.",

If we want to make a political intervention that is party political we act as the Labour Metro Mayors, and if it just affects the north then the Northern Labour Metro Mayors.\nAs all Mayors are in favour of more and better devolution that is often our focus. We know our areas. In particular I’ve been lobbying for improved fiscal powers like Land value capture and earn-back. Mechanisms which could help our area retain money, not by taxing you more, just retaining the money that is already spent.\nAs Labour Mayors we’ve made many interventions. On transport we raised issues about the Integrated Rail Plan, lobbied for fair funding for buses and light rail during covid, and continue to lobby for a better rail network for the North. We need Northern Powerhouse delivered in full if the true prosperity of the North is ever going to be realised.\nWe acted together as the Northern Labour Metro Mayors during the covid pandemic when the government where planning the impose Tier 3 restriction on Manchester, Liverpool and the North East.\nWe support the Trade Unions right to defend their livelihoods and supported workers excluded from government support through the pandemic.\nIn addition to the public facing lobbying a lot of collaborative work also happens between the officer teams.

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-better-landlords-than-the-people-who-live-there-themselves/content_261.html": "What Better Landlords Than The People Who Live There Themselves\nMay 7, 2023\nIn December 2020, Awaab Ishak died. He was killed in his home. Where he should have been safe. He was two years old. He was killed by mould.\nHis story really hit the press two years later. Rochdale Boroughwide Housing was criticised by the coroner. His parents had raised the problem with them years earlier. They kept being told to paint over the mould. They made a whole series of complaints, but to no effect. In the end their little boy died. I can’t even begin to imagine how that feels.\nAfter the coroner’s report into little Awaab’s death, the government announced plans to introduce changes to the law on damp and mould in social housing – known as ‘Awaab’s law’. It will require landlords to fix reported ‘health hazards’ within a specified timeframe.\nBut it only applies to social landlords. Not to private landlords. You might recall a Labour amendment to the 2016 Housing Bill to compel private landlords to maintain their properties in a state fit for human habitation. 309 Conservative MPs voted against it, and the amendment fell. Many of those MPs were private landlords.\nAwaab’s Law won’t apply to private landlords. Local authorities have some powers – their stretched and underfunded teams can issue specific notices where breaches are found. Yet there is still no blanket regulation requiring housing to be fit for human habitation.\nCitizens Advice found that 1.6 million children live in privately rented homes with damp, mould or excessive cold. With energy prices sky high, this is even more urgent.\nHomes are rated with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) from A, the most efficient and well insulated, to G, the leakiest and most wasteful. Tenants of private landlords are 73% more likely to be living with damp if they live in a property with an EPC rating of D-G rather than A-C. On average a private tenant pays £350 a year more on heating because of poorly insulated homes. Landlords are only required to bring properties to an E rating and don’t have to make any improvements costing over £3,500.\nThe private rented sector has doubled in the last 20 years. In 2021, rents outside of London increased at the fastest rate on record. There are good landlords and not so good landlords. Lovely landlords and criminal landlords. We can’t change human nature, but we can change the systems that reward bad landlords. Sometimes it’s a simple as fining people who break the law.\nIf you regularly read my column, you’ll know we’re working with government to secure a £4.27 billion devolution deal for the North East. As part of the trailblazer, we’re negotiating to get powers to regulate the private rented sector. If landlords had to meet a certain standard before they could rent, we’d see the 25% of private rented homes that are unfit brought up to standard very quickly.\nThis would massively reduce the chances of a tragedy like Awaab’s death happening again.\nWe could combat the climate crisis too. We could demand that landlords’ properties not only meet health and safety standards but also a higher level of energy efficiency.\nLet’s fix up people’s cold, damp houses. Install heat pumps. Solar panels. Better insulation. This not only improves people’s health and wellbeing – it saves money on healthcare spending. Every £1 we spend retrofitting homes saves the NHS 42p. Add in the energy savings, the economic boost from the jobs created, and it pays for itself.\nOf course the simple answer is to allow councils to build homes, without being financially hamstrung when they get sold out from underneath them.\nAt the North of Tyne, we’re using the Brownfield housing fund to open up sites across Newcastle Northumberland and North Tyneside. And we block any sites that don’t have affordable housing – like the Strawberry Place development that hit the news recently.\nAnd what better landlords than the people who live there themselves? I’m talking about community-owned housing. We have plenty of existing buildings standing empty that would make great flats and apartments. Why not turn them into housing co-operatives? And then asset-lock these so they can’t just be sold on, to the detriment of those living there. I’m making the funding available and supporting communities who want to take these projects on.\nI want more homes. Where families are safe. Where children are safe. Which don’t cost the Earth. Where they’re on good public transport routes so people can get to their work or education quickly and cheaply.\nAnd I don’t want there ever to be another case like Awaab Ishak.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_billionaires-are-not-inevitable/content_167.html": "Billionaires Are Not Inevitable\nMay 18, 2020\nOur Secret Superpower is our Ability to Cooperate\n(18-05-20)\nNot my words, but from a great new book, Human kind : A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman. You may remember him, he’s the guy who called out the super-rich at Davos last year, telling them to pay their taxes. And wondering why 1500 private jets had flown in to hear David Attenborough talk about climate change. Perhaps next year they’ll Zoom.\nIn Western culture there’s the long-held view that we humans are a selfish and bestial lot. Always on the brink of a “war of all against all” and that Lord of the Flies got it about right.\nBregman tracked down a real-life Lord Of The Flies. Six school children lost in a storm and marooned on a rocky Pacific Island for fifteen months. Rather than a descent into barbarism, they solved all the tasks of survival by cooperation. It’s a tale of loyalty and friendship. Even when one boy broke his leg, the others cared for him.\nIs a dog-eat-dog world where million use foodbanks, while a handful are billionaires, inevitable?\nSome claim that survival of the fittest, and ‘Devil take the hindmost’, improves the fitness of us all. It doesn’t, and it never has. It’s a complete misreading of Darwin. It’s not corporate raiders we’re clapping every Thursday at 8pm. Our survival is intricately dependent upon cooperation.\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment purports to show that when students were separated into guards and prisoners, the guards became abusive. Yet in his book The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil, Philip Zimbardo documents the efforts he took to push the guards to be abusive.\nBut cruelty does happen. Sometimes on an industrial scale. Hannah Arendt spoke of the banality of evil of Nazis involved in the holocaust. People become distanced and desensitised, and participate in gross crimes because they become cogs in a machine.\nOne of the biggest enablers of dehumanisation is systems, and slavish adherence to systems. ‘Computer says no’. ‘It’s more than my job’s worth’. ‘I’m just following orders’.\nThis week is national Mental Health Awareness Week. Kindness is the theme. Doing something for others out of a sincere motivation to help. Social solidarity in other words. We’re seeing it right now in the hundreds of Mutual Aid groups across the country. The communal clapping for NHS and other keyworkers.\nIt’s our nature to help others, that’s why it’s good for our mental health. Kindness helps reduce stress and low mood, brings a fresh perspective and boosts our self-esteem. It is an antidote to isolation and helps create a sense of belonging and community. Just as cruelty creates a vicious circle, kindness creates a virtuous circle.\nThis crisis has exposed the faulty wiring of a system that extols competition above cooperation. People are not economic units, driven by the desire to consume. Living like that causes no end of harm, for the individual, for society, and for the planet.\nCampaigning for economic equality doesn’t make you a ‘social justice warrior’ or a ‘bleeding heart liberal’. The “selfish consumer” model just doesn’t add up for the bottom line either. It’s not sustainable and it’s incredibly wasteful. Research shows that in all but the simplest tasks, treating people with humanity leads to higher productivity than disciplining them.\nHaving kindness and collectivism as a key principle for policy makes good, hard sense. It builds on our natural inclination towards solidarity and cooperation. More equal societies are always top of the league for happiness and quality of life.\nI’ve quoted from Hobbes and Arendt, and referenced Bregman and Zimbardo. If we’re looking for a story to model human behaviour, let’s not use Lord Of The Flies. My youngest son was moved by something more recent. He has a quote on his wall he chose from Paddington 2.\nIf you look for the good in people, you’ll find it.\nEveryone who has clapped for our keyworkers now needs to become a campaigner for change. As part of the recovery from the pandemic, let’s build on the humanity and resilience shown by grass roots movements. Let’s end the false economy of cuts and austerity once and for all, and realise that looking after each other makes sound economic sense.\nOur ability to cooperate and be kind are our superpowers. Let’s use them to build back better.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_a-peoples-bank-explained/content_58.html": "A People’s Bank Explained\nApril 22, 2019\nBanks are essential to a modern economy. Banks keep money flowing. Cash machines, direct debits, card payments, and other transactional functions. Then there’s savings, mortgages and loans – if you had to save up and pay cash, no one would ever be able to afford a house, and businesses would struggle to expand. The economy would grind to a halt overnight.\nBanking went badly wrong in the 1980s, leading to the banking crash of 2007-8. It dragged down the world economy, and paved the way for the Conservative and Lib Dem governments to use it as an excuse for austerity. Austerity has devastated the prosperity of ordinary working people, we’ve seen the rise of foodbank Britain, an exponential rise in in-work poverty, slashed public services, all while the mega rich have made out like bandits.\nBanks got greedy, and engaged in speculative banking, instead of sticking to bread and butter retail banking – such as current accounts, mortgages and business banking. Some of the people who ran the banks engaged in unethical and frequently illegal activities, and were encouraged to take risks by the promise of million pound bonuses. In Britain, we, the citizens, had to bail out the banks to the tune of £500 billion to stop the financial system from collapsing. (Compare that to £39 billion a year to fund all the UK’s schools).\nAcross the world, one kind of institution kept trading throughout the international banking crisis, largely unaffected. These were the regional mutually owned banks. The customers owned the banks, and the banks focused entirely on day to day banking (called retail banking), and did not engage in risky speculation. Sadly, these types of bank are common in other advanced economies, but not here. Germany has 1024 regional cooperative banks, and a much stronger small business sector as a result.\nThere are billions of pounds sitting in current accounts in our region, earning no interest, that are being transferred out of our region to be used anywhere in the banking system. The People’s Bank will recycle these funds into our region and nowhere else.\nThis is what I want to facilitate here, in the North East. It will give our regional economy a major boost.\nHow Do We Set Up A Bank?\nUsing the Mayor’s “functional power of competence” I will establish an independent cooperative to begin the process of establishing a bank owned by its customers – the people and the small & medium businesses of our region, based here and recycling the savings of our region into loans for our region.\nA huge amount of work has been done, reviewed and paid for by others, that is available for a North East People’s Bank to licence. I’ve worked with a team of specialists and banking experts who are setting this model up across the UK, looking to licence a bank in each region. They’ve hired top accountancy firms like KPMG to advise and check the data, and commissioned and piloted the technology to make this bank work. Already, four regional banks in the UK are well advanced on this route (Wales, North West, South West, and Greater London), and have raised £millions to get their regional banks established. This lowers the risk for us.\nMy first step on this route after being elected would be to commission a due diligence report. An independent accountancy firm would look at all the numbers on the business model, and verify that everything stacks up. If it doesn’t, then no further public money will be committed to the project. This costs about £40,000 – so that’s the maximum initial risk: a tiny amount for huge potential benefit. If the plan passes due diligence, the mutual society will be established, and initial staff hired to guide through the start-up process. The Mayoral authority would commit to fund this stage of the operation, costing approximately £300k. This will take us through the stages of application and detailed business planning.\nOnce the first regulatory hurdles are cleared, an additional £2mn funding is required. By this stage, the model is proven, and the PRA and FCA want to see the bank capable of operations before granting the full licence. So initial staff are recruited, IT systems installed and premises acquired. At this stage, the risks are reduced, and investment partners will be invited from ethical investment funds. This implementation phase will take about a year, and if successful a banking license will be granted. At this point, the bank is operational, and the final tranche of capital is required in order to begin full operations. This is where most of the capital is required, another £18mn is needed, taking the total capital investment to £20mn. By this stage the risk is much lowered because the bank already has its licence, and all its systems have been proven by the regulators. Finding ethical capital investors will not be difficult – indeed, it will offer a better return than many public sector reserve investments.\nThe whole process will take two and a half to three years from commissioning the due diligence to being fully operational. Over the next five to six years the bank would grow to maturity, opening more branches and attracting more members and customers. After nine years, the bank would be highly profitable, serving tens of thousands of customers, and making around £20mn a year in profit, which the customers can vote to allocate – some to local good causes, some to support lending to start-ups and community enterprises, and some as a dividend to members.\nIt’s worth stressing again: the Mayor’s authority would not own this bank. It will, however, gain an annual return of 7.5% on any money invested in the bank once it is mature. So if the Mayor’s authority put in £2mn over three years, it would gain a return of £150k per year ever after – excellent value for the taxpayer.\nSome Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat will it offer?\nA full range of banking services: current accounts, mortgages, cards, and crucially, business banking for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It will have full online systems, by app and by browser, and will have physical branches. Relationship banking will be at the heart of it. You’ll get to speak to the bank staff, and there will be mutual trust built up. There will be no, “computer says no”. All customers will become members of the bank, getting one vote per person, and deciding on things like the directors’ pay.\nWhy does the bank need £20mn? Is that enough?\nThe £20mn is what’s called Tier 1 capital. It’s the money needed to make sure a bank has enough reserves to withstand a financial shock, such as if an unexpected number of borrowers all default at the same time. The Bank of England sets the amount, according to what is known as the Basel III accord – new rules put in place after the financial crash to stop banks going belly up in future. The regulators require a new bank to have 5mn Euros, but the model we’re looking at wants to be extra safe, and so will operate with £20mn. The bank will then have a license to accept deposit from local savers, protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and carefully lend this to local borrowers. So it will be able to lend out much more than £20mn, making interest on all of it. The bank will be able to lend over £400mn, and as it matures, its retained earnings will allow it to grow further. It’s a bit technical for this blog, but if you’re interested, look up Basel III Risk Weighted Assets.\nWhat’s a Banking Licence?\nTo be a bank, a business has to undertake an extensive application process. This takes anything up to two and a half years. It is overseen by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Once granted, a bank has unique powers – it has a Bank of England reserve account. It can accept deposits for savers, it gains interest on its reserves, and can borrow at base rate from the Bank of England.\nUntil recently, it was very hard to establish a new bank, and all but impossible to establish a new mutual bank. In August 2014 a change in the law made it possible for Cooperative banks to raise capital without giving away voting rights, so it’s now possible to raise the capital much more easily.\nWhat’s the difference between this and a credit union or a building society?\nCredit unions are excellent institutions, offering savings and loans to local communities, and providing a real alternative to payday lenders. They are typically very small in scale, and often have a limited range of capabilities, such as not having direct debit facilities. They are extremely unlikely to offer mortgages or business banking, limiting their size.\nBuilding societies are, in one sense, very large credit unions, although they almost never serve local communities in the same way.\nBuilding Societies are there to primarily provide mortgages for residential property. Few offer current accounts or are focused on the needs of Small and Medium sized businesses.\nThey are owned by their members, although participation in decision making is almost non-existent, and there are sometimes issues with “fat cat” pay – for example, one CEO was getting £2.25mn a year! Because they don’t have shareholders, they can sometimes offer good deals on mortgages and savings compared to PLC banks. They don’t have full banking capabilities, though, such as a Bank of England reserve account, and don’t offer business banking.\nIs the Mayor allowed to do this?\nAbsolutely. The Mayoral Authority has what is known as “Functional Power of Competence”, which means it can do anything an individual can do, even if it’s not been done by a local authority before. That’s why we need a Mayor who understands the law, and has the visions for what is possible, and how we can make the best use of public money to bring prosperity to our region. In debates, my opponents have dismissed the idea, making a series of factually incorrect objections: they haven’t done their homework.\nIn 2017 Redwood Bank opened, a highly successful specialist bank that lends to SMEs. It gained 33% of its funding from Warrington Borough Council. The Welsh government, and at least six other local authorities are already well advanced down the route to opening regional banks on and identical model to the one I propose. They have raised £millions between them.\nWho will run the bank?\nNot me! To be the chief executive or chair of a bank you have to be personally approved by the regulators. I might be highly knowledgeable as a layperson, but this is a job for a professional with years of experience at a senior level. It’s a case of hiring the right person, who is looking to build a bank based on solid principles of mutual trust and responsible banking. A great many people in the banking profession subscribe to these values.\nWill you look after the staff?\nThe bank will be a model employer. Everyone will be paid at least the Real Living Wage, and there will be a maximum pay ratio of 10:1, meaning the highest paid gets no more than ten times the lowest paid. Employment contracts will adhere to the best standards, the bank will be a champion of diversity, and there will be zero gender pay gap.\nOnce it’s fully mature, we’d expect the bank to employ around 100 people.\nWhy is it good for the local economy?\nIn short, it keeps money here. When people borrow from banks, money leaks out of our region in two ways. First, the bank is usually headquartered far away, so most of the jobs it supports are not here. Secondly, a large amount of their profits are paid to the shareholders as dividends. Often, these shareholders are in turn holding companies. Even at today’s historically low rates, you’ll end up paying 60p in interest for every £1 you borrow. For a typical homeowner, that’s 12% of your entire take home pay leaving our region. Keeping that money here creates spending power here, creating more jobs and more prosperity.\nLocal businesses will get interest on their current accounts, and more access to the finance they need. There’s about £1.4bn in business lending to SMEs in the NE postcode area alone. The interest on this lending goes to banks based outside our region, with shareholders needs placed above the customers’. We do have some building societies here, but they can’t have business banking, because they do not have the same legal form as a bank.\nThe bank will also support local community causes once it’s mature and in profit, and of course, create high quality jobs here.\nIs banking profitable?\nRetail banking is astonishingly profitable. A bank can access money cheaply, and lend it out at a higher rate – the difference between the two is called the interest margin.\nHave a look at the table to see how much the main banks make in profit – typically £1bn profit for every £3bn income!\nSmaller banks are even more profitable – they’ve largely been unaffected by the banking scandals like PPI insurance, and so don’t have to pay out compensations for historical misdeeds.\nGermany has 1024 successful banks that run on this model.\nWasn’t the Northern Rock like this?\nNo. The Northern Rock formed in 1965, after the merger between the Northern Counties Permanent Building Society, founded in 1850, and the Rock Building Society, founded in 1865. After 147 years of successful trading, through recessions and world wars, it demutualised and became a bank and a PLC in 1997. Within 10 years it went belly up, and had to be bailed out by us, the tax payer.\nHow can we protect it?\nA wave of building societies were “demutualised” in the 1990s. In effect, they were sold from under their members’ noses in return for £500+. The law was later changed, and no more have been demutualised. We’ll be writing stronger legal safeguards into the bank’s constitution, known as an “asset lock”.\nWhat about Atom Bank?\nSome people have made mention of Atom Bank, based in Durham. This is a totally different financial model. Atom Bank is a digital only bank, available through an app and offered only savings accounts and mortgages. It has no branches and no business banking. They decided to set up all their own IT systems, instead of licensing technology from other institutions. In order to expand quickly, they offered very high rates to savers, and very low rates to mortgage borrowers – a loss leader. They grew their loan portfolio from £0.1bn to £1.1bn in a single year! In other words, they made a deliberate decision to lose money in order to expand very rapidly. In order to raise capital to bolster their reserves, they sold a controlling stake to the Spanish Bank BBVA. I wish them luck – if we can have a successful business located here in the North East, great! But it’s not a model we will be following.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_invest-in-staff-and-they-will-invest-in-you/content_239.html": "Invest in Staff and They will Invest in You\nApril 12, 2021\nThe notion of a job for life is fast receding. Not so long ago, a job at “The Ministry” in Longbenton, or maybe with the local council, meant financial security. Not in any sense of luxury, but the stability to raise a family, followed by a decent pension after you’d put in your decades of service. Whole communities thrived around the pit towns and villages in South East Northumberland or the shipbuilding communities along the banks of the Tyne and the Wear.\nEven when I started work in the mid 1980’s, the goal for most working class kids was to get into a skilled profession. Apprenticeships date back to the guilds of the middle-ages. The 1964 Industry Training Boards formalised the system. It took at least four years to qualify, and you had a skill that would earn you a living anywhere you went. But with over three million unemployed, coupled with the dismantling of British manufacturing, we saw that quality of industrial training all but disappear. By 1990 traditional apprenticeships accounted for less than 1% of the workforce.\nAfter the riots in Brixton, Toxteth, Handsworth, Chapeltown and Moss Side, the 1983 Youth Training Scheme was launched. You got an extra tenner on top of the dole, and an introduction to the world of work at a time when youth unemployment was sky high. The scheme was criticised as a poor comparison to a proper apprenticeship. Lasting only six months to a year, and offering little in the way of skills training, too few YTS placements resulted in permanent jobs. The whole approach was the wrong way round. If your starting premise is, “we have a load of kids who we need to stop from being idle” you’ll never design anything sustainable.\nAlmost as bad is the “we need to train kids as a supply of skilled labour for businesses” approach. While it seems logical at first glance, it does not survive contact with economic reality. Innovation, automation, and technological disruption make it damn near impossible to train anyone for a lifelong career in an industry that might not exist in ten years time.\nJobs and skills are two sides of the same coin. It’s just under two years since I was elected Mayor. Already we’re creating 3,200 new jobs by supporting local firms and bringing new ones here. This past week we’ve landed 200 more high-skilled, well-paid jobs in Newcastle with Global Software company Xplor. If we’re to thrive as a region, as a country, there has to be a route for people to retrain and get these jobs.\nOur jobs can be a source of pride. One of the first things we ask when we meet someone, or when a friend tells us they have a new romantic partner, is what they do for a living. But this can also be self-limiting – people can typecast themselves.\nOften, the best way to retrain is inside your existing workplace. Until recently, the Union Learning Fund worked with union reps to encourage people to increase their skills and progress their careers. They could earn more, and their employers benefited from continuity. The withdrawal of this fund by central government was so short sighted. Every £1 spent generated £13 in increased productivity. I’m working with the TUC to see how we can replace it in the North of Tyne.\nEveryone needs the opportunity to retrain throughout their life. We’re embedding this principle into the North of Tyne adult education programme. We’re only responsible for a small part of the skills landscape, and that was only devolved in August last year. But we’ve already enabled nearly ten thousand adults to pursue a new career and expand their horizons.\nThere is a difference between training and education. Training prepares you for a specific set of tasks, but education develops your critical thinking and ability to adapt. We made a big mistake in this country by charging for university education. Britain stands at a crossroads. We can allow millions of our citizens to struggle to find skilled work.\nOr we can invest in lifelong skills and education so everyone can find a good job whatever their stage of life.\nOriginally Published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 12.4.21",

But many are put off because of bike theft, road safety fears, and poor integration with public transport.\nI’ll support our local authorities to roll out more and better walking and cycling routes that stay off the roads and avoid dangerous crossings – and there is much good work to build on. I’ll support more initiatives to help kids walk or cycle safely to school, like the great success we’ve seen at Hotspur Primary in Heaton.\nI’ll establish a bike hire network at key public transport interchanges and secure cycle locker parking across the network. Bike theft is a major reason people don’t cycle. If someone has their bike stolen they are 25% more likely to give up cycling.\nI’ll create a car club network so everyone can hire a car at short notice, by the hour. My preference is to support the expansion of existing car clubs that exist so their coverage becomes near universal. Hire starts form £5 an hour.\nOnce people have the security that walking, cycling and public transport can meet 90% of their transport needs, and they can hire a car at short notice for low cost, many really will choose to save the £thousands a year it costs to own and run a car. That improves health, our economy, and our environment. And leaves us with more money in our pockets.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_its-time-to-finish-the-job-i-started/content_125.html": "It’s time to finish the job I started….\nDecember 26, 2023\nChristmas can be joyous and fulfilling. It can be challenging time for people, too.\nWhatever your situation, I hope you found moments of peace and joy yesterday. For me, I’m probably the classic festive cliché. Eating cold leftovers for days. Falling asleep on the sofa watching Wallace & Gromit. Reaching a point where half a box of Quality Streets is seen as an acceptable breakfast choice – even through the best ones have already been eaten.\nThis will be my last weekly column for a while. The editors have asked me to stop writing until after the Mayoral election in May. To be honest, it’s been a privilege, and thanks for all the excellent feedback. You can still read my weekly blog on JamieDriscoll.co.uk or social media.\nSo what better time to reflect on the last few years and look forward to the opportunities of 2024.\nThis time last year I was fielding calls from journalists about our new North East Devolution Deal. A deal now worth £6.1 billion to our region. A recurring question was, “How did you secure the deal?” The answer’s simple. I put politics to one side and worked with all parties to deliver for the people of the North East. Some see politics as a blame game. I’d rather just get things done. It’s what you’re elected to do.\nOur excellent track record as the North of Tyne Combined Authority also helped us land the best funded devolution deal in the country. As Mayor, my main target from Government was to create 10,000 jobs within 30 years. In less than 5 years, our investments are creating 5,377 new jobs. We’ve hit our 2035 target already. We’re 11 years ahead of schedule.\nWe’ve also helped more people get these good jobs, with free, flexible vocational training courses. When central government was in charge of adult skills, we had 21,885 course enrolments a year. Once adult education was devolved to me, we increased it to 35,230. On the same budget. A 61% increase in value for money.\nWe’re also building 1,948 new homes on brownfield sites. With low-carbon and affordable housing. Including council homes.\nWorking with partners in Northumberland County Council, we’re re-opening the Northumberland line from Ashington into central Newcastle. It’ll start taking passengers in 2024.\nWe’ve invested £25 million in offshore wind and we’re tackling child poverty in 98 schools.\nThere’s no template for running a successful combined authority. Devolution is just a vehicle, you need the right driver. My goal was always to build a zero-carbon, zero-poverty, North East, with thriving modern industries and richer communities. We’re making real progress. And we’ve done this without borrowing money or putting a penny on your council tax bills. People of ordinary means already pay enough tax.\nAll of this was achieved against the backdrop of a global pandemic, war in Europe and the Middle East, and political chaos in Westminster.\nSo what does the future hold? The truth is nobody knows. So, instead of making predictions I’ll make a resolution. To finish the job I started in 2019.\nThe North of Tyne Combined Authority was always just the beginning. I knew that the real prize of devolution was transport. Getting transport powers and money required bringing the region together from Berwick to Barnard Castle. I’ve done that. From May we’ll have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a modern, efficient, reliable transport system.\nIf I’m re-elected, this time as North East Mayor, I’ll build a Total Transport Network. London style fully integrated public transport under public control. With cross-ticketing, low fares and free travel for all young people 18 and under.\nFor too long we’ve been the poor relation to London and the South East. Why shouldn’t we have the best public transport system in the country? Why shouldn’t we be the beating heart of the Green Industrial Revolution? Why shouldn’t we expect well paid jobs and secure, thriving communities? We know that we can’t rely on Westminster to solve our problems, so let’s be bold and creative in finding our own solutions.\nThis is my New Year’s resolution: to continue fighting for the North East – and getting results. As my Mam always said, ‘shy bairns get nowt’.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_one-year-as-mayor/content_144.html": "One Year as Mayor\nMay 4, 2020\nA year ago on Thursday our people elected me Mayor of the North of Tyne Combined Authority. I knew that building a new organisation would be a challenge. On my first day, cameras & film crews outnumbered the staff. But I had no idea what a rollercoaster year it would be.\nIn my acceptance speech, I spoke about the chaos our economy faced. I had no inkling of a pandemic. But July heralded a new Prime Minister, after the Conservatives ditched Theresa May. In September, the government signalled its intent to accelerate devolution. With less than half my team in place, we had to move fast to draw up new plans. In October we faced a Brexit crisis, the possibility of a cliff edge, and all the behind the scenes planning. December brought the disruption of a snap General Election. Those outside politics might not realise that we’re prevented from making announcements or spending commitments during an election period. Then, just as we were ramping up our investment programme, we’ve been hit by a pandemic the like of which has not been seen for a century. And a shortage of pasta and loo rolls (which I don’t claim to have predicted either!).\nI’m a huge advocate of devolution. At present, the North of Tyne’s budgets and powers are a fraction of those of other cities. Despite this, I’m determined that we make people’s lives better, in ways that matter to them. And despite this extraordinary year, we’ve made a cracking start.\nOn my first day of office, as promised, I declared a Climate Emergency. I said we’d provide world-class environmental education, and we’re rolling out a programme for a UN-accredited climate change teacher in every school in the region. I said I’d convene a Climate Change Citizens’ Assembly, and that’s ready to go the minute the Coronavirus restrictions are lifted. We make better policy when we involve our citizens in decision making.\nI said I’d develop a Green Industrial revolution. We’ve allocated £24 million to create jobs in offshore renewable energy and low carbon innovation. This must be a Just Transition, where our workers’ security is paramount. So we’ve established a special £2 million fund for workers to retrain for green jobs.\nWe’re investing £10 million in the region’s digital economy. What does that mean? Everything from helping smaller firms ‘go digital’ so they can be more productive, to tackling digital exclusion. For example, providing Chrome books (and tech support!) for people who aren’t online. As we saw with I, Daniel Blake, not everyone is part of the online revolution.\nI’ve worked to create jobs. Verisure announced 1000 jobs after I and my North of Tyne team worked to bring them here. Thousands more jobs are in the pipeline – although with the current situation, we can’t be complacent.\nProsperity must extend to everybody. Our programmes are helping the economically disadvantaged get skills, support and counselling. People who’ve been away from work caring for family members, people struggling to pay their rents in social housing, and people from disadvantaged communities are all being helped. All these programmes have the same underlying approach – treat people with dignity. Help them don’t sanction them.\nAll those workers we clap on a Thursday night must not be forgotten once this crisis passes. I said I’d establish an employment charter, and we now have our Good Work Pledge. Accredited employers pay the Real Living Wage on fair contracts, and Trade Union recognition is embedded. We practice what we preach, North of Tyne is a Real Living Wage employer with a zero gender pay gap and flexible working.\nI’m proud of the team we’ve built at the North of Tyne. None of this would have happened without skill, good humour and sheer hard work. The credit must be shared by the entire staff and Cabinet. Plus the staff and Cabinet Members from Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland Local Authorities.\nNow we’ve been hit by the Juggernaut of Covid-19 and the economic consequences that will follow. I’ve put £5 million to support our Local Authorities to help those micro-businesses falling through the gaps of government support. I’ve been lobbying government to protect our buses and Metro.\nThere’s more happening – much more than one column can cover. Work is underway on the People’s Bank, on the cooperative economy, on sustainable housing, and our Education Challenge.\nSo log onto Mayor’s Question time this Thursday, 7th May, to hear more. It’s free and open to all. You can register a question in advance, and it’ll be a Facebook Live at 7pm. Facebook.com/NorthOfTyneMayor.\nWe will come out of this. But we have to make sure the recovery is about more than a return to January 2020. All of the challenges we faced with poverty, inequality, and of course climate change will all exist, and in most cases, will be compounded. The road out of this will be long, and many of the problems will need years to fix. The United Nations Disaster Relief organisation uses the strap-line Build Back Better. We can imagine a different world that is greener, cleaner and kinder. That’s going to be my focus for Year 2.\n[A shorter version of this article was first published in The Chronicle and The Journal on Mon 4th May 2020]",

So we can sustainably make transport free for under 18s and everyone in full time education. This directly tackles child poverty. It sets good habits for the future, too. Walking a few hundred metres to a bus or Metro stop makes a difference to health over the years, compared to just jumping in the car.\nThe Total Transport Network will give everyone the option of signing up for a flexi season ticket, using either a smart phone or a pop card. It will track how much you’ve spent over time, and once you hit a certain amount in a year, you’ll get free travel the rest of the year. This will incentivise people to switch to public transport, without having to pay a large amount up front.\nAs part of the total Transport Network, we can offer tailored discounts, or free travel, on an individual basis. So volunteers can get free travel when volunteering, apprentices can get to college. We can work with the NHS to help people get to appointments via on-demand transport.\nI will lobby to get Salary Sacrifice extended. At the moment you can get a bike or electric car on salary sacrifice, but not public transport. The advantage is that your employer takes the cost of a season ticket out of your wages, but you save the income tax and national insurance costs, so it’s typically 32% cheaper. Public and private employers could also offer discounts as a perk for employees, boosting recruitment and retention, and meeting their net-zero commitments.\nWe’re already offering reduced fares across the North East, using the bus money that we negotiated from government. This is time limited however, so we do need to increase public transport use.",

But the toppling of the Edward Colston statue looked peaceful. And remarkably well organised. I wasn’t there, but I’ve seen no reports that anyone got hurt. No looting, no arson. No riot. I have seen reports that the police handled the matter with great tact and sensitivity – well done Avon & Somerset Constabulary.\nEdward Colston oversaw the kidnap and enslavement of around 84,000 people, including 12,000 children. 19,000 died in the crossings from Africa to the Americas. Their bodies were dumped into the water, unmarked, unrecorded. For years campaigners have tried to get a plaque on the statue to state this truth. Richard Eddy, a local Tory councillor objected to the idea of a new plaque, and said he would not condemn anyone who vandalised it. The protesters who pulled it down are now being criticised for taking non-violent direct action.\nSo what’s the criticism based on? It’s that “they” didn’t play by “our” rules. The correct, establishment, way to commit vandalism is with lawyers and a cheque book. And do it properly. Underfund and privatise the NHS. Oppose laws that require landlords to maintain houses fit for human habitation. Slash and burn your way through the economy, so literally millions of people need foodbanks. Reverse eco legislation for housing. Strangle our public services with austerity while letting tax dodgers get away scot-free. Legalise fracking. Pump megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

And the collective disbelief when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland started doing car impressions from the platform. He then quoted Lenin, compared himself to Moses, and after losing his place, a bizarre tangent about Peppa Pig. The assembled business audience weren’t impressed. Asked about the failure to invest in rail links to the North East, the PM said it was all going to be brilliant. Then mentioned Warrington, Marsden (near Huddersfield), Birmingham and Nottingham. Every one of those places is south of the M62.\nWhat a contrast to Tony Danker, CEO of the CBI. He said industry’s priorities are investment in research and development, industrial strategy around building clusters of expertise, and investment in skills training. And gently mocked the idea that Peppa Pig world was the way to level up the North.\nBy the way, this idea that Labour was ever hostile to business is rubbish. Firms that look after their workers are a blessing. It’s tax dodging, fire-and-rehire, and asset stripping that we want to eradicate. Something we share with every ethical business out there. In fact, Tony Danker praised the work we’re doing in the North of Tyne.\nIt’s not all meetings and speeches, of course. Most of my job is about delivery. Building links with businesses to boost the local economy. Joint working with colleges and universities. Working through policy proposals with the team, and adding the weight of the Mayoral office to bring people together and get things done – letters, Zooms, and old fashioned phone calls. Plus vast amounts of reading – budget reports, policy reports, investment reports. Being on top of the detail matters, but doesn’t translate into an interesting newspaper column.\nExtended North East devolution is on the agenda. North of Tyne leaders are discussing what’s needed across the North of Tyne, as a precursor to dealing with Government. Rural Northumberland has different priorities for the urban core of Tyne & Wear. Different, but reinforcing. Better rail connections benefit Morpeth and Hexham as much as Gosforth and Gateshead. Affordable housing is an issue in Beadnell and North Shields. We all want to create more jobs.\nWednesday, a train to Leeds for the Transport for the North Board (TfN). It was a feisty one. Last week’s Integrated Rail Plan stirred a hornets’ nest. I spoke in detail about how and why we needed the Leamside Line reopening, and it was adopted into a unanimous agreed position from the TfN board.\nThe Secretary of State needs to sit down with us and find the mechanisms for delivering the full Northern Powerhouse Rail project. Specifically, all five Metro Mayors present want powers on Land Value Uplift. Northumberland Council have been piloting this for reopening the Northumberland line. I’ve been pushing this with treasury ministers and officials. When taxpayers fund a new railway station, the land around it shoots up in value. Rather than going to property speculators, it should fund the project.\nWith those powers we can build new Metro extensions, stations in rural Northumberland, and superbus routes across our region. At the People’s Powerhouse Convention on Thursday, Andy Burnham was kind enough to point out that I’d led the thinking on this. There are decent politicians about – not everyone is in it for the second jobs.\nThursday evening was Mayor’s Question Time at the Catalyst in Newcastle. After talking about White Ribbon day – the campaign to encourage men and boys to stand up to violence against women and girls, I took questions. Details of the jobs we’re creating. The climate education we’re delivering in schools. Mobility scooter access on the new Metro trains. Improving health through better economic outcomes. Affordable housing. The balance between work and family life. And too much else to cover here. We’re chopping the video up into question-sized chunks and publishing it online.\nEarly Friday, and a train down south. I chaired a conference building political, business and university links between the North East and Bavaria. The comparisons and contrasts are fascinating. We share a strong regional identity. Far from Berlin, Bavaria was the poorest region in Germany. It grew into the richest by using devolved powers. We’ve agreed to build links on research and development and the green economy, so time well spent. Plus the personal connections – on Friday evening, a Bavarian minister sang us a German song, and I felt it was only fair to reciprocate with the Blaydon Races.\nThen home by Saturday night, and seeing the snow and disruption caused by Storm Arwen.

I was due to meet John McDonnell and his team immediately afterwards – it would have made an interesting comparison, since we won’t get to see Mr Javid debate Mr McDonnell. Saj has refused; perhaps because John McDonnell would have shown that Labour governments borrow less and repay more than Conservative ones. Google it, if you don’t believe me: Taxresearch.org.uk has a detailed analysis.\nThe whole point of devolution is to give control to local people. More spending is needed, it’s true. Schools have had to lay off teachers, other teachers are on zero-hours with supply agencies. A quick look at schoolcuts.org.uk paints a stark picture of a country failing to invest in education. The NHS has almost 100,000 vacancies, it’s only surviving because of the million hours of unpaid overtime every week. Everyone now recognises Boris’s bus slogan of “£350 million a week for the NHS” was a lie.\nMore money is vital, but it’s local decision making that’s transformative. Who understands an industry or service better than the people who work in it? Who understands the needs of a community better than the people who live there?\nTake Wooler, for example. High Streets across the country are struggling with empty shops and shrinking footfall. Northern towns doubly so. Wooler has bucked the trend by developing a community hub – a key plank of my election manifesto is to develop these across the region.\nThe Glendale Gateway Trust has been growing since way back in 1996 – and it’s long-term local control that’s the beating heart of its success.\nThe Trust took an old 19th century workhouse, standing derelict, transformed it, and in 2001 opened at as the Cheviot Centre. It’s buzzing – a branch library, Tourist Information centre, meal clubs and soon to host a branch of the Newcastle building Society. There’s distance learning courses via video conferencing – a climate friendly way to support adult education. There’s timber-framed ‘pods’ out the back that look like upturned Viking ships, cheap space for local businesses to get started without having to risk long leases. The sum total of all this activity pays the bills and keeps the hub self-financing. More impressively, it sparks community engagement, “The kind of cross pollination of ideas that the Cheviot centre offers is essential,” the Trust’s chief executive, Tom Johnston, told me.\nIt’s sparked other initiatives. They took on the local Youth Hostel to save it from closure. It is now leased to Karl and Cindy, who’ve made it a thriving venture that brings people to the town. It supports everything from trail running events to guided wildlife lectures.\nThe Trust developed an old Co-op site into eighteen affordable homes and is now a registered social provider. Too many rural communities are dying – holiday homes raises property prices, making it impossible for locals youngsters to raise a family where they grew up.\nThe old Barclays Bank is being developed into a restaurant, with more flats upstairs, to give year round footfall on the High Street. It took an interest free loan of a quarter of million to get the Trust up and running, but for twenty three years now, they’ve quietly been creating jobs, boosting community cohesion, keeping the High Street vibrant, and supporting local businesses.\nI asked Tom and the trustees how they’ve managed to keep the Trust running so well for over twenty years. “We have a term limit,” he said. “You can be a trustee for a maximum of nine years – that means we’re always training new people up, and the old hands are always around for advice.”\nIt’s a microcosm of democratic public ownership – let the people who live and work there make the decisions, and reinvest all the profits for the future.\nI often ask politicians and civil servants: if it’s such obvious common sense to devolve budgets, why is everything controlled from Whitehall? The answer is: Ministers like to cut ribbons.\nThis article first appeared in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 18th November 2019",

Am I wearing the right clothes? Have I done enough groundwork? Am I in the right frame of mind? Months of preparation comes down to this moment. I know the supporters will keep me going.\nYou’re on the starting line…\nThis could be the start of the Great North Run. It’s also a good description of the Mayoral election in 2019. In between we’ve had Covid. It scuppered the GNR in 2019. This year, Covid uncertainty made sponsors nervous. Spacing runners into waves added complexity and cost.\nOn 28th June 1981, the first Great North Run took place. It was a trailblazer. I was 11. Life in the North East was a bit different then. Come to think of it, life in the whole country was a bit different then. We even won the Eurovision Song Contest. With 40 years of history, we could not risk it failing.\nI first spoke to Brendan Foster about it back in February. The GNR is the biggest half-marathon in the world. Over 50,000 runners. The North of Tyne Combined Authority put £400,000 funding to keep the GNR secure.\nIt’s worth £33 million in economic benefit to the region. It puts us on the map. It fills 25,000 hotel bedrooms. £24 million raised for charity.\nIt’s a massive regional success story broadcast live in 137 countries around the world. We sponsored the film, Great North: A Run, A River, A Region which opened at the Tyneside last week. It’s on local cinemas – and well worth a watch.\nThere’s more to the GNR than numbers, though. Brendan persuaded me to run this year. My training was going well, until I got a calf strain a fortnight ago. My physio has been brilliant – shout out to Jack Gilmour. “You’re obviously going to run,” he said, “so let’s work out how we can get you round. But forget any hope of a personal best.”\nDashing around at the start. I started the elite women’s race. My friend, Lord Mayor Habib Rahman, started the wheelchair race. Best of all was the main race was started by NHS workers: I chatted to Community Nurse Dorothy and Cardiologist Micky, who like me were also running.\nI’ve done long runs before, marathons and half-marathons. But nothing is like the Great North Run. It’s the sheer diversity. The awesome ability of the wheelchair athletes. The bravery of the blind and visually impaired athletes.\nBefore I even got to the Tyne Bridge, my calf-tightened. We knew it might, and had a plan. I slowed right down to a jog. It was a blessing in disguise – I got to pay attention to everyone else.\nThe sheer selflessness of thousands of people – doing something so physically gruelling – without any interest in personal reward. Cancer Research. Breast Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Blood Cancer. St Oswalds Hospice. McMillan Nurses. Shelter. Strokes. NSPCC. Mental Health. Help For Heroes. British Legion. Every one of them about healing and helping. I was running for veterans’ charity Forward Assist. Apologies to all those I haven’t got space to mention.\nCountless people running in memory of loved ones. Personal stories about healing the grief.\nAt mile 9 I had to pop into the first aid tent for some Vaseline. I hadn’t had a chance to break in my new top, and jogger’s nipple struck – blood soaking through the white fabric like a pair of brake lights.\nI watched the strength and compassion of all those tens of thousands of people. The runners. The volunteers. The supporters. All the kids I high-fived on the way round. I’m proud to come from the North East. That pride – that support – that sheer generosity of spirit – got me round and across the finish line.\nAlong the Felling bypass I had one of the most amazing experiences of my life. A fellow runner ran past me, pressed a £20 not into my hand, and said, “Good man – good cause.”\nWe’ve had a hell of an eighteen months. We’ve come through Covid. So many have experienced tragedy. When we come together in unity, we are strong.\nThis is our Region. This is our Run. Let the healing begin.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 13 Sept 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_you-dont-need-to-feel-powerless/content_322.html": "You Don’t Need to Feel Powerless\nAugust 21, 2022\nIt’s coming at us from all sides. The cost of living crisis. The price of petrol. The climate emergency. The war in Ukraine. Hospital waiting lists. Winter is coming. Many, many people will not be able to afford to heat their homes or cook a Sunday dinner. It all feels a bit overwhelming.\nThere’s a saying, “No one can do everything, but everyone can do something.” To see that philosophy put into practice, in real life, is inspiring.\nA little while ago, some neighbours in Heaton got together. They decided to clean up the grubby back alley behind their homes. I went down there earlier this year. Colourful flowers and trees have now replaced broken glass. Raised beds and plant pots seize your attention. Now, at the height of summer, the flowers and in bloom and the fruit is ripening on the young trees. There’s a sense of care – of pride, even.\nLast month, I spent an evening with the good folks at Shieldfield Art Works. They worked with the local community to transform a patch of grass, next to a car park, into a beautiful green haven in the city with fruit trees and climbing flowers. A place where children can play, where people can come together and forge friendships. Somewhere restorative.\nAmy and Claire are both parents of disabled children. Both are driven to provide their kids with opportunities they may not get otherwise. Together, the two friends created Sensory on the North Sea. It’s a fantastic charity that has given around 200 disabled children the chance to be skipper of a catamaran for a day. The kids can drive the boat (even doing donuts, I’m told!) and have a whale of a time. The wind in their hair, splashes from the cold sea, the smell of salt, the whhrrrr of the engine – all of it is sensory stimulation these kids don’t always get but is key for their development and wellbeing. When it’s over, they and their families dock on dry land with a wealth of cherished memories.\nThese are just three of a list of community projects from our #CrowdFundNorthofTyne programme. I say ‘our’ programme, because it’s a partnership. We stick in some cash, but it’s local people – like you – who do the creative work.\nHow it works is you have an idea for a project where you live. Then you pitch it to us, and so long as it’s a project for genuine community benefit, you’ll probably qualify. Then it goes on the website, and you can share it on social media or by word of mouth. If your project is popular, it will get lots of likes and pledges. When a project can show real community support, it gets a chunk of money from us to push it over the line and reach the goal. Grants range from a few hundred quid to £15,000, depending on the project. Simple. It’s all explained on the website.\nWe launched the scheme two years ago. I knew that you’d know your area and your community better than I do. And I wanted to empower you to make a difference.\nSince then, we’ve given nearly £83,000 to 23 grassroots community projects. They cover Northumberland, Newcastle, and North Tyneside. They’ve included everything from bee-keeping to film-making. We’ve just opened our fifth round of funding, with another £90,000 available. If you live in the North of Tyne, and have an idea for a project, you can get in touch right now.\nAnd here’s the thing. It doesn’t need to be all or nothing. You don’t have to be a human dynamo to make a difference in your community. You’re not alone. That’s what’s special about #CrowdfundNorthofTyne and the community projects it serves. Some people can lead the charge. Some might volunteer. Others may only be able to pledge the price of a coffee to someone with a great idea for improving their community. We all need each other.\nSo have a look – Google ‘CrowdFund North of Tyne’. And could you do me a favour? Tell people about this project, and encourage them to apply.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 22 August 2022",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_with-power-comes-responsibility/content_232.html": "With Power Comes Responsibility\nDecember 6, 2020\nAre metro mayors properly scrutinised? That’s a question I was asked at last week’s Parliamentary Select Committee on devolution. Steve Rotherham, my counterpart in Liverpool City Region, says that we are the most scrutinised politicians anywhere. To get something done as Mayor, I have to persuade the 6 council leaders and deputies in my cabinet. Then there are 38 members and substitutes of various scrutiny bodies, and 41 people on our advisory boards. So my answer to the committee was, “Yes. At North of Tyne scrutiny works well.”\nThat’s how it should be. With power comes responsibility. Whether in elected office or an owner of a large business, you should be transparent and accountable for your decisions. American President Harry S. Truman had a sign on his desk saying “The buck stops here”. Yet in 2020 Britain, the powerful are showing contempt for this maxim. Too many behave as if the rules are for others and not for them.\nLook at what’s happening on our high streets. The impending collapse of Arcadia, the retail empire which includes Topshop and Burton. The families of thousands of retail workers now face anxiety about paying their bills, rent and mortgages this winter. 13,000 jobs could go, and 10,000 of the employees’ pension pots are at risk.\nAnd what’s the Arcadia chairman, knight of the realm Sir Philip Green, doing? He’s lounging on his £100 million super-yacht “Lionheart” in Morocco, enjoying his £1.2 billion fortune.\nTony Blair’s government gave Sir Philip Green his knighthood in 2006. Let’s hope Sir Keir Starmer does more than call on him to “do the right thing”. The shift away from trade union support and towards big money donors is a concern. The loss of votes in Labour heartlands can trace its roots in this kind of cronyism. Labour needs to stand tall in defence of working people and their livelihoods.\nThere’s a misconception that socialists like me oppose entrepreneurship and wealth generation. The opposite is true. I oppose wealth extraction, asset stripping and tax dodging. I oppose corporations like Starbucks who dodge their taxes. I oppose bandits who pay themselves £billions in dividends while bleeding pension funds dry. The pension contributions of those workers are deferred wages. It’s nothing short of legalised theft.\nI support the hard-working entrepreneurs who own and run local coffee shops. I support the 2 million ExcludedUK, the owners of small business who Rishi Sunak has abandoned. Driving instructors, independent shop owners, freelance workers, micro-brewers and everyone else who is part of that rich ecosystem of small businesses. I support them with actions, not just words. Earlier in the year the North of Tyne funded shared workspaces so business who don’t pay business rates could stay afloat. Rishi Sunak needs to step up now, or we’ll see millions of small owner-managed businesses go belly up.\nThis culture of elite contempt for rules, for the “little people”, and impunity from consequences is embedding itself in government. The Home Secretary’s bullying is ignored. Covid rules don’t apply to special advisors flouting lockdown.\nLast month’s National Audit Office report into Covid procurement revealed a shocking “chumocracy”. Companies placed in a “high priority” channel were ten times more likely to be awarded a contract. How did you get into this channel? Expertise? An established supply chain? No. It was knowing a minister. Chumocracy indeed. Some might call it corruption.\nCompanies like Ayanda Capital Ltd – a currency-trading firm with no relevant expertise –won a £225 million contract to supply face masks for the NHS. When the product arrived, it was duff and unusable. We need a public inquiry into the management of the Covid pandemic.\nBusiness and sleaze have long worked hand in hand but rarely on such a scale and without any apparent risk of consequences. There has been little pushback or scrutiny from parliament, let alone any minister taking responsibility and resigning. But they’re not all the same. This week Tesco voluntarily repaid £585m Covid business rates relief government had given them. You might ask why government gave them this golden windfall in the first place, but hats off to Tesco.\nAt North of Tyne I’ve worked hard to make us a transparent and accountable organisation. I was able to tell the Parliamentary Committee how we are embedding a culture of accountability. How we co-design our policies with the people affected by them. And on a personal level, I hold Mayor’s Question Time, write a weekly column, and produce a weekly video of what I’ve been doing.\nWhether in business or in politics, trust matters. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 7.12.20",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_could-you-be-could-you-be-squeaky-clean/content_309.html": "Could You Be, Could You Be Squeaky Clean….\nJanuary 16, 2022\nIt turns out that a serial liar has been caught lying. That a member of the Bullingdon Club was attending boozy parties in lockdown. Surprised?\nThat Boris Johnson’s premiership is circling the drain makes me sad for two reasons.\nFirstly, it was blindingly obvious to anyone with any understanding of human behaviour that the man was unfit for high office. He was sacked for lying. Twice. From The Times in 1987 and by Tory leader Michael Howard in 2004. He lied to the Queen about proroguing Parliament. He said “let the bodies pile high in their thousands.” He has been abusive to just about everyone who isn’t him – from “flag waving picanninies with watermelon smiles” to “tank-topped bum boys.”\nSome thought it a good idea to put a clown in charge, because he would say the things they wanted to. They were wrong. A character like Johnson was never on their side. He is always on his own.\nHis 1995 article makes it clear, “… the modern British male is useless. If he is blue collar, he is likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless, and perhaps claiming to suffer from low self-esteem brought on by unemployment. If he is white collar, he is likely to be little better.”\nThat’s you he’s talking about. Or your Dad, your brother, your son or your husband. He displays the same contempt for the rules as he shows for people.\nSecondly, I’m sad because it’s his personal failings bringing him down, not his political actions. Tears for Fears nailed it with their 1989 song, Sowing the Seeds of Love. “Could you be, could you be squeaky clean and smash any hope of democracy?”\nWhat if Johnson hadn’t attended those parties? Would everything still be alright?\nTake one example. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill going through Parliament right now.\nPolice can already suspend protests that cause serious disorder – quite right. But this new legislation will make “serious annoyance” or being a “public nuisance” illegal. A judge will be able to jail a person for up to 10 years. Seriously. A police officer will be given powers to take “such conditions as appear necessary” to that officer “to prevent disorder, damage, disruption, impact or intimidation.”\nDid you notice the word “impact” snuck in there? What the hell is the point of a protest that has no impact? The legislation should be renamed the Father Ted Bill. “Down with this sort of thing,” and “Careful now!”\nIf your local beauty spot is going to be bulldozed, your protest could land you in jail. Not happy with who owns your football club? Better not protest, or you could get 10 years. Your employer failing to keep you safe? Better stick to a strongly worded letter, or else jail for you. Oppose the closure of your local school or hospital? Don’t want a bypass through your village? Better make sure your protest has no impact, you criminal. Whichever way you vote, Johnson and his ilk will throw you under the bus.\nI asked some police constables what they think of the Police Bill this weekend. “I joined the police because I want to protect vulnerable people. Not to stop people protesting,” one officer told me. Former Chief Constables have criticised it as a “politically motivated move towards paramilitary policing.” How long before these powers are used by private security firms?\nProtest is an essential part of healthy democracy. My fourteen year old son attended the protests against the Bill in Newcastle on Saturday. He wants to study medicine, and be a doctor, like his Mam. I can’t help thinking how many of his generation will end up with criminal records for peacefully campaigning for a better world.\nI’m unhappy because this Bill stays whether Johnson goes or not. Whether they broke lockdown rules or not, Tory MPs broke their manifesto pledge and voted to raise National Insurance. Voted to deny hungry kids school meals through the holidays. They’ve announced plans to effectively abolish the BBC from 2027.\nThere’s another line in Sowing the Seeds of Love: We’re fools to the rules of a Government plan.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_we-may-all-be-daniel-blake/content_202.html": "We May All Be Daniel Blake\nSeptember 7, 2020\nIf a week is a long time in politics, a year is an age. An independent documentary crew asked if they could film my first year in office. Last week, I saw the final edit. The contrast between last summer and now was marked. Gone are the busy rooms, handshakes, and meetings. Now everyone I talk to appears in the same place: on my computer screen.\nSo many people in those clips were doing jobs that depend on proximity. Venue management. Audio-visual technicians. Caterers. Meeters and greeters, PAs and event hosts.\nThe furlough scheme is winding down in October. Millions are facing the threat of redundancy. Some sectors still need support, notably culture and events. The government needs to revise the furlough scheme and give them direct support. But so many other business models depend on footfall. The people who fit out offices. The sandwich shops whose trade depends on the office block round the corner. With home working set to become a permanent trend, many small business will struggle to survive. Businesses have tried innovative ways to bring money in. But they’re swimming against the tide.\nWhether self-employed people can access help seems to depend the luck of the draw. One in seven UK workers are self employed. Delivery drivers, builders, sports commentators, company directors, hairdressers…it cuts across social divides.\nThe available funding is called the Self-employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS). HMRC identified 3.4 million eligible people based on their self-assessment tax return for the last 3 years. Of these, 75% applied to the scheme. This in itself is astonishingly high. It means only 25% of self-employed businesses are viable under Covid. In addition to that 3.4 million, we’ve got self-employed people who need support, but are denied. This includes anyone newly self-employed in the last year, about 200,000 people. Anyone earning more than £50k, even if their income dropped to £0 under Covid, another 225,000 people. Anyone earning less than 50% of their income from self-employment, about 1.2 million people. This non-self-employed income could be a pension, redundancy money, or salary from a job which ended earlier in the year. In total 1.6 million people nationally have been left to fall through the safety net. I and many others have told government. But they’ve done nothing.\nIn January, 3.8% of 16 to 64 year olds in the North of Tyne claimed benefits. By July that rose to 6.8%, marginally above the national average of 6.5%. On top of that, by July, 29.5% of the workforce in the North of Tyne were on furlough. The national rate was 29.9%.\nWhite collar jobs in particular are facing a crisis. Fewer jobs are available, and the number of applicants has increased threefold. I’ve seen a junior local government post attract applicants from as far as Spain, Bulgaria and the USA. People in middle-management are facing unemployment. They’ve never had any contact with the benefits system. If they or their partner have savings, they may not qualify. Or shares, or an ISA, or even a redundancy payment. They’ll soon understand why people like Ken Loach have been making films about it.\nThe government’s plan to hire more work coaches is all very well. But unless there are actual jobs to be had, people will be chasing their tails.\nWhat needs to happen? Instead of dishing out contracts to mates, government should invest in the public services gutted by austerity. Then we might get a test and trace system with the skill and capacity it needs.\nWe’ve got Brexit coming up. We still haven’t hired and trained the extra customs officers we need. Above all, we need a Green New Deal. We should build homes for affordable rent. Retrofit houses to save energy and keep people warm and healthy. Build wind turbines to provide cheap, plentiful electricity. Build a clean transport system. One that’s safe, and cheap, and works for everyone, from 8 to 80. In the North East alone, this would create 38,000 jobs.\nIn November, the government will announce its Comprehensive Spending Review. The North of Tyne is submitting our plan for economic recovery. Its foundation will be creating good quality jobs in a Green New Deal.\nOriginally Published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 7.9.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_underfunding-public-services-is-bad-economics/content_35.html": "Underfunding public services is bad economics\nMarch 10, 2024\n“Good public services need a strong economy to pay for them. But a strong economy also needs good public services.” I can’t disagree with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s statement.\nI’m all in favour of lowering NI contributions from working people. Just not at the expense of destroying our public services. One in five councils think they’ll go bust this year. 7.5 million people waiting for NHS treatment. Three million people in destitution. Not relative poverty, but destitution. Charities closing. Small businesses struggling. A shoplifting epidemic killing our high streets.\nUnderfunding public services is bad economics – costing us more in the long term.\nAbolishing non-dom status alone won’t help us rebuild them, raising around £2 billion. But the budget now means there’s no difference whatsoever between Labour and Conservative tax policy. Both lock Britain into ever deeper austerity.\nLabour were angry at the Tories for adopting their policy. Mind you, it makes a change from Labour adopting Tory policies. Like the two child benefit cap, lifting bankers’ bonuses, and a self-imposed fiscal rule that even right-wing economists say makes no sense.\nI find this objection to the Tories abolishing non-dom status baffling. Surely, if it’s a good policy, you want to see it adopted. Candidates in the Mayoral race have adopted some of my policies on public transport. I’m glad about that. They are good policies. In fact, I haven’t heard anyone say they’d drop any of the policies I’ve implemented at the North of Tyne.\nIf Sir Keir and Ms Reeves don’t like the 2p cut in National Insurance, why do they say they’ll keep it? And if they thought it was a good idea, why didn’t they lobby for it? No wonder only 12% of people trust political parties when they play games with our livelihoods.\nWe could raise £12 billion by equalising capital gains tax with income tax. Other, very modest wealth taxes on people with assets over £3 million could raise £50 billion a year, and incentivise productive investment. But Labour and the Conservatives have ruled it out. They plan to let the rich get richer, while our councils go bust and a million kids stay hungry.\nMr Hunt also said, “Dynamism in an economy doesn’t come from ministers in Whitehall.” Enough said.\nThere was some good news. He confirmed the North East’s ‘trailblazer’ status. This puts us in the Premier League of devolution. An extra £100 million on top of the original North East deal. Including £37 million for Sunderland Riverside, where the plan is to build major new film studios. And £58 million for much needed maintenance to the ageing Metro system. Plus influence over central government policy in our region on housing, energy and biodiversity.\nWhat’s been barely reported is the Government has agreed to take forward my proposals on Land Value Capture and a Regional Wealth Fund. I’ve campaigned for these since 2020, and even written academic papers and spoken at think tanks about them. It’s a way of us generating local wealth without taxing either local businesses or people’s incomes.\nWhen the public sector builds new transport infrastructure, for example a Metro extension and stations, the value of the surrounding land shoots up, generating a windfall.\nUnder my proposals for Land Value Capture no one pays anything until they sell that land. The charge would be less than the windfall, so the landowner keeps a share, and the rest pays for the new infrastructure.\nA Regional Wealth Fund of £500 million could create 14,000 jobs by investing in businesses right across our region. Adding to our pipeline of more than 5,000 jobs already – a decade ahead of our target from government. Building a more prosperous North East for the generations to follow.\nBest of all, the investment profits come back to the public, rather than disappearing off to hedge funds in tax havens. It’s working already – companies we’ve invested in are returning a profit to the North of Tyne. This new announcement allows us to scale it up.\nThe first Mayoral hustings were in Durham last week. I asked the audience in if they thought anyone would turn on the public spending taps after the General Election. Not a single hand went up. Not even Labour party members believe their party will end austerity.\nBut in the North of Tyne we are investing for the long term.\nI haven’t raised Council Tax or increased debt. But we have levered in over £300 million from the private sector. We’ve increased enrolments on adult skills courses by 60%. We’re creating jobs 3 times faster than our government-set target. We’re building over 2,000 homes on brownfield land.\nWhen you have a record of achievement across the board, you know it’s not down to luck.\n“Growth up, jobs up and taxes down.” Jeremy Hunt might say it. We’ve done it.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_employers-risk-their-own-growth-by-not-employing-a-diverse-workforce/content_300.html": "Employers Risk Their Own Growth by not Employing a Diverse Workforce\nNovember 27, 2022\n“We don’t live in a meritocracy”, writes Reni Eddo-Lodge in ‘Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race’. “To pretend that simple hard work will elevate all to success is an exercise in wilful ignorance.” If I’m honest, I find the truth in that statement discomforting. I grew up in Teesside. Hardly Richmond Upon Thames. Deep in the Thatcher recession. I left school at 16. I worked low-paid jobs and moved up and up until I got here, the elected Mayor of the North of Tyne.\nI’d like to think I achieved it all on merit alone. But I know that as a straight white non-disabled man I encountered far fewer barriers along the way than if I was disabled, gay, trans, a woman, a person of colour, or any intersection of those. And while I don’t think I’m ignorant in the way Eddo-Lodge describes, I understand that being aware of a problem is nothing like experiencing it. There’s a chasm between knowing the stats about discrimination and knowing what discrimination feels like, in your bones.\nWhen I was elected, I promised to use my powers to host an ‘Equalities Assembly’. This would bring together local residents with ‘protected characteristics’. People who face barriers to finding good work because of their age, gender, race, disability, and more. We focussed on jobs because we work with hundreds of local employers. Training providers, too. We know there may be something we can do to make a difference.\nWe held one assembly in person, and one online for people who – because of childcare responsibilities, neurodiversity, or other reasons – preferred this format. It was here, at these events, that I listened to stories of discriminatory practices I didn’t even know existed.\nOne participant spoke about how the jobcentre told her to change her name on applications to something more “English-sounding”. Several times, I heard of people with high level qualifications in their home country falling victim to a vicious cycle. Apply for a similar job here. Get rejected because your qualification isn’t recognised in the UK. Apply for a lower-level job. Still get rejected, only this time because now you’re ‘over-qualified’. If you do get the job, the lower-level role is later used against you when you do go for a higher position. Compound disadvantage in full effect.\nThe challenges didn’t end once they’d got a job, either. Racism and sexism forced people out of roles. Another attendee had Autism and dyspraxia. They’d secured a good position with decent managers at a national company. But then their manager changed – and they stopped getting the support they needed.\nA young single mum who’d experienced serious hardship described how she’d landed an “amazing” job. Working a few hours, each week. Limited hours meant she could afford the limited childcare. But now the jobcentre is pushing her to increase her hours. If she does, she won’t be able to afford childcare. If she doesn’t, her benefits will be cut. I can see what participants meant when they spoke about Universal Credit and “a sense of being trapped”.\nThe rooms were buzzing with ideas about how the North of Tyne Combined Authority can try to reduce and remove some of these barriers. One suggestion was convening a ‘truth commission’-style meeting, bringing together employers and people who’d experienced barriers to work. Another was campaigning for spreading out a three-day a week, full-time role into a five day a week, ‘school time’ job – enabling parents to balance careers and childcare. My team and I have some serious thinking to do about how we can use our position to bring about some lasting change in the region.\n“Employers are missing out on some real gems”, said one participant. They’re spot on. Employers risk their own growth by not employing a diverse workforce.\nDiversity of background and experience means diversity of knowledge, character, thought, and ideas. What smart employer wouldn’t want these things? After all, as one attendee put it perfectly: “if you want resilience in an organisation, come to the people who have faced challenges.”",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_education-for-children-not-government/content_170.html": "Education for Children not Government\nAugust 23, 2020\n“Politicians are terrified of U-turns. They look indecisive” I wrote two months ago.\nThe sound of screeching tyres accompanied last week’s handbrake turn. Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson were adamant that Ofqual’s algorithm was “robust”. Until they suddenly declared it was all Ofqual’s fault. I wonder what grade our school leavers, parents and teachers would give this indecisive government.\nThis fiasco started in March. Ministers gave an explicit instruction that the number one priority was to avoid “grade inflation”. That’s why the algorithm worked the way it did.\nThe result? Kids from state schools in poor areas were downgraded. Not one pupil from Eton had their results downgraded. Because BAME communities are disproportionately poor, Ofqual’s model hammered black pupils’ results. This is not abstract. If you’re from a poor background, downgraded results can tank your future. These kids don’t have the connections and financial support to find an alternative way onto the career ladder. You don’t see kids from poor areas taking unpaid internships. So much for levelling up.\nThere is more to this than simple incompetence. The government’s policy-making is based on an exam system designed for the wrong purpose.\nMany educators now refer to the “tyranny of testing”. A culture of relentless exams, spurious league tables and artificial competition between schools. Schools pressured to become exam-factories. The typical English child undergoes more than 70 tests in a school career. Way more than the rest of the industrial world.\nWhen I ask employers how do they choose one young person over another, the answers are always the same. A youngster who can make eye contact in an interview. Who comes across as confident. Who demonstrates independent thought.\nSo why have exams at all? The medieval Chinese civil service introduced them to separate nepotism from competence. The British Empire needed a cohort of educated chaps to administer everywhere from Canada to India. Standardised handwriting and quick mental arithmetic were essential. It even allowed for a degree of social mobility. As long as you knew the LBW rule.\nStandardised testing, then, is not a form of education. It is a form of selection. So we can rank young people, and say who is more worthy of advancement. Is it really that far from Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, where alphas have a different life trajectory from deltas?\nExams do have a benefit when they are diagnostic. They’re fast and efficient ways of telling a teacher what the gaps are in a student’s knowledge. Like any diagnosis, it must be followed up with treatment. Researcher John Hattie found that exams at the start of a course produce much better education than testing students at the end. By then it’s too late to do anything about it. Check out his Ted Talk on YouTube: Why are so many of our teachers and schools so successful?\nEducation should focus on raising ability, not ranking kids and schools against each other. Competitive education misses the point. How many jobs in a workplace are competitive? Sharing your work with your colleagues good practice. What use is a footballer who can’t pass the ball to a teammate?\nJohn Hattie did a massive study of different education polices. The policy that made the most difference to educational outcomes? Supporting teachers to work together collaboratively. It shouldn’t be a surprise. Skilled professionals, working together, is the bedrock of all progress. This is the foundation of the North of Tyne Joint School Improvement strategy.\nOur Education Challenge is going through the Department for Education right now. We’re seeking £10 million a year to improve our kids’ education. We want to raise professional standards by supporting teachers and schools, not pitting them against each other. We’ll be able to put resources into supporting families to get kids “school ready”. We’ll look after their mental wellbeing throughout their school years, giving everyone immediate access to counselling.\nTeachers want to do more than “teach to the test”. It’s about time education served the needs of our children, not our government.\nFirst published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 24th Aug 2020.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-queens-speech/content_49.html": "The Queen’s Speech\nDecember 8, 2019\nToday is the Queen’s Speech. Perhaps Boris Johnson will actually win his first Commons vote as Prime Minister. For a man who is so opposed to socialism, he spends a lot of time getting publicly owned.\nI don’t know why we still pretend that the speech belongs to the Queen. I’ve never met her; I’m told she’s very polite, a quality I prize highly in people. But the pretence that it’s Her Majesty’s Government is increasingly tenuous after the recent proroguing of Parliament for party political advantage, and the subsequent High Court confirmation that it was illegal. And how can we possibly take the programme of legislation in the speech seriously? The PM can promise whatever he likes, given that he intends to dissolve Parliament for an election within weeks.\nWhat’s in it? I can guess – lots of noise about a clean break with the EU. Which is impossible. Even crashing out with No Deal we’ll still have to negotiate a future trade deal, just from a weaker position. And lose 10% of all the jobs in the North East in the meantime.\nAnd there’ll be a lot of greenwash. Claims about how they’re serious about reducing emissions by 2050. Twenty years too late, but hey-ho.\nUnfortunately for him, this week saw the publication of every MP’s climate vote score. Mr Johnson scored exactly 0% on his voting record over the past ten years, supporting fracking, opposing the solar and wind industry, and taking whopping donations from oil companies and climate-change-denying think tanks. In 2013 he wrote that “wind turbines would not pull the skin off a rice pudding.”\nAll the parties are on election footing. Last Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn was in Newcastle rallying the troops, his eighth event in five days. I had a long meeting with him, to discuss how as Mayor I can deliver Labour’s national priorities. How the North East can lead the way on green transport, on renewables, on building affordable housing, on rebalancing our economy to prioritise long-term sustainability over short-term profit seeking. More than two-thirds of Labour’s national investment will be delivered by devolved government. There’ll be 10,300 jobs in offshore wind alone, with profits reinvested in our coastal communities. And long term, this investment all pays for itself.\nThe contrast between the two men is remarkable – and I’ve spoken to both of them recently. Jeremy’s depth of knowledge of the housing industry, and understanding of how to close the skills gap and create jobs to meet Labour’s housing target of a million new homes. The facts he has at his fingertips on the capacity of rail lines, the details of high street banking, and despite being a Londoner, his knowledge North East communities. To be fair, Boris Johnson’s jokes are better than Jeremy’s, but by that logic, we should appoint a comedian as Prime Minister. Ah…\nOur region was built on coal and steel. The phrase “coals to Newcastle” was used as far back as 1538. We started the industrial revolution; at one point more coal was shipped from the mouth of the Tyne than was mined in the rest of the world put together. Stephenson’s Rocket was built on Forth Bank in Newcastle. We were in our innocence about climate change, and the fact that global sea level rises will submerge half of Tyneside, and threaten our food security.\nThere’s an alternative. We’ve always been innovators. Hydro-electricity was invented in Northumberland. The electric light bulb was invented in Gateshead.\nTo all the cynics and misanthropes who say we should do nothing because climate change is a global problem, I say we should be the home of ambition. We have the chance to reboot our economy. To create thousands upon thousands of well paid jobs. If we decarbonise by 2030, we’ll show the rest of the world it can be done. Let’s lead the world with a Green Industrial Revolution.\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 14th October 2019.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-should-labour-do-to-win-the-next-election/content_166.html": "“What should Labour do to win the next election?”\nJuly 30, 2023\nJim Naughtie interviewed me yesterday for Radio 4’s The World This Weekend. What, he asked, should Labour do to win the next election?\nTurn up, I was tempted to say. After thirteen years of austerity, failing public services, cancelled and non-existent public transport, Mr Johnson’s illegal party going and Mr Sunak’s glaring conflict of interest over tax loopholes, a Labour victory should be a racing certainty. It’s a pretty low bar. After all, the last Conservative Prime Minister was beaten by a lettuce.\nBut you’ve got to be concise in a broadcast interview, and Mr Naughtie hadn’t asked me about the Government’s record.\nElections are won and lost on economic competence, I said. And economic competence depends on your personal circumstances. If you’re doing the same job as last year, but your wages are falling behind prices, that’s going to hurt. If you can’t get a bus to work, it’s a real world problem.\nThe Conservatives will spin wedge issues, and culture wars, and attack ads. But there is an underlying reality. There is an objective truth to the pain people are feeling in Britain today. What people want are political leaders with a credible plan to fix it.\nPeople are not stupid. They know Sir Keir keeps breaking his promises. They just dislike the Conservatives more. That’s what we saw with last week’s by-elections. Tory voters stayed at home, causing a huge swing to the Lib Dems in Somerton and Frome, and to Labour in Selby. Less reported is that Labour came fifth in Somerton, and the Lib Dems sixth in Selby. Both main parties lost their deposits.\nLet’s assume, for now, the General Election is October 2024. That’s fifteen months away.\nNeither party leader is particularly charismatic. So Labour needs to get some points on the board before the inevitable gaffes and wedge issues. And if the Greens get their media act together, they could poll a lot of votes in the space Labour has abandoned. The Greens might not win, but as in Uxbridge, Labour could lose.\nBut here’s the real issue: people don’t trust politicians because politicians don’t trust the public. Many politicians are terrified of telling the truth – in detail. Not because they are inherently dishonest – most aren’t. They use clichés and filibuster because they’re terrified of having to answer a follow up question and explain their position. And they usually don’t know – in detail – what their position is.\nWe’ve got ourselves into a ridiculous situation where His Majesty’s Official Opposition were calling for a General Election, while simultaneously refusing to tell you what they’d do if they won.\nThis is ludicrous. No entrepreneur would go to a bank without a business plan. No academic would publish a paper and hide it from peer review.\nMost voters are grownups. Show them you’ve got a plan to fix something, and they’ll listen. They understand you can’t fix everything everywhere all at once. But to win their trust pointing at a problem is not enough – you must say HOW you will fix the problem.\nAnd they’ll want to see your plan tested in debate. Let the other side challenge you. Voters will judge you not by how slick your plan sounded at first, but by the credibility of your answers to difficult questions. Hiding convinces no one.\nAt the moment Labour are not basing their policies on what’s needed to fix Britain, but are instead responding to the Conservatives political manoeuvres. That leaves them hugely vulnerable.\nWhat happens if Jeremy Hunt says, “We’ve looked at the finances, and we think it makes sense to invest £30 billion a year to make Britain a leading clean energy superpower.” There is literally nothing stopping him – it makes economic sense.\nThank you, said Jim Naughtie, that’s crystal clear. He seemed surprised that a politician gave a direct and comprehensive answer to a direct question.\nAnd that’s my plan. Between now and the Mayoral election in May 2024, I’ll be holding meetings in communities across the North East. You can come and ask me any question you like – within the bounds of public decency and propriety, of course. I hope you’ll find my answers as crystal clear as Jim Naughtie did.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_towns-revitalised-across-the-north-east-thats-my-aim/content_184.html": "Towns revitalised across the North East – that’s my aim\nAugust 6, 2023\n“Can you show me somewhere that tells the story of your mayoralty?” asked The Guardian’s Helen Pidd a couple of weeks ago. “Yes – I said. Why don’t we start with Blyth?”\nThe town has certainly had its fair share of highs and lows. In the first half of the twentieth century it boasted one of the largest shipbuilding yards on the North East coast. By the 1960s its port was one of the busiest in England, shipping over 6 million tonnes of coal.\nBy the time I worked there as an engineer in the 1990’s there was widespread social deprivation. A legacy of deindustrialisation from the deliberate government policy of putting all the UK’s economic eggs in the City of London basket.\nThat’s one side of the story. Now Blyth is a green tech pioneer – home to the UK’s first offshore wind farm. The renewables industry is thriving. World-class turbine testing facilities at the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult. The new Energy Central Learning Hub partnering directly with schools to train the wind turbine engineers of the future. The North of Tyne Combined Authority has put money into both.\nWhat makes a town somewhere good to live is both simple and complex. Simple – because most people want a decent job, a home, a chance to learn, and something interesting or fun to do when they’re not working. Complex – because it’s easier to destroy those things than to build them.\nBut build them we must.\nThat’s why we’re investing in Blyth. Investing big and investing small.\nInvesting big in infrastructure. In smaller businesses in the renewable energy supply chain. In the Northumberland Line that will bring passenger trains back into service between Ashington and Newcastle when it opens next year. Cutting journey times and carbon emissions in half. If you drive along South Newsham Road you can see Combined Authority money put to good use building the new Newsham station.\nInvesting in local businesses to help them grow. The money we put into Merit Holdings down the road in Cramlington has helped them buy a new factory and grow from 130 to 330 well paid jobs. 70 more at Cleardata on Kitty Brewster industrial estate.\nJDR Cable Systems announced a £130 million subsea cable factory last year. They manufacture the cables that connect offshore wind farms to the grid. 171 local jobs already and more in the pipeline.\nInvesting big to give people the skills they need for a good job. Backing initiatives like Build North East to unlock hidden talents or start a career in construction, rail engineering or landscaping. Part of the 50% increase in skills training we’ve delivered since devolution is happening in Blyth.\nInvesting big in housing. We’re using our Brownfield Housing Fund to clean up the site at Lyndon Walk to build 13 new independent living homes for elderly people. It’s all affordable housing. 49 more homes on Commissioners Quay.\nInvesting big to help children growing up in poverty. In Newsham Primary School, families weren’t taking second hand school uniforms – parents didn’t want to seem needy. So they rebranded it as ‘recycling’ clothes as part of the school’s climate programme. Almost overnight people started taking them.\nInvesting small too, knowing that it doesn’t always cost a fortune to improve people’s everyday lives. Crowdfund North of Tyne raised £2,184 for Blythfest to hire street artists in their fortnight-long festival of arts and entertainment.\nAnd investment from us encourages investment from others. A new cinema and cultural centre to be run by the award-winning Jam Jar Cinema is set to open next year. Partnership working is what it’s all about.\nIn many ways Blyth is the North East in miniature. Friendly and hard-working people. A beautiful landscape, right by the sea. Good fish and chips too.\nA proud industrial heritage that too often has been let down by distant politicians who’d struggle to find Blyth on a map.\nDevolution – having power and money in our own hands – puts us in the driving seat. Not just for the 40,000 people in Blyth. But for the entire population of 2 million from Berwick to Barnard Castle.\nTowns revitalised across the North East – that’s the happy ending I’m aiming for.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_does-groupthink-explain-why-so-many-mps-accept-hospitality/content_165.html": "Does Groupthink explain why so many MPs accept ‘hospitality’?\nAugust 27, 2023\nThe lack of trust in politics erupted again this week with evidence that over 100 MPs have taken £180,000 in hospitality this summer. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, deputy PM Oliver Dowden, Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting, all on the list. And that’s only what’s been declared – anything under £300 can remain undeclared by MPs.\nNow I don’t mind Ministers doing their jobs. If you’re giving a speech to the tech industry, then going to the dinner is fine – it’s work. And the rules already reflect that. But why does the Chancellor need £600 tickets to the Chelsea Flower Show? He’s a millionaire!\nWhy does Sir Keir Starmer need free tickets worth £698 tickets for a Coldplay concert? He’s loaded.\nWorse still, why did Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds accept £3,000 of hospitality from Google to go to Glastonbury? He was in the Labour front bench delegation that visited Google a few months ago. Days later they changed their policy of taxing tech giants, letting them off £3.2 billion in tax. Do you think it passes the sniff test?\nThere’s another serious question. Sir Keir’s go-to defence for abandoning his policies and breaking his pledges is “we will do anything to win the next election”.\nBut if winning the election is worth abandoning any moral backbone, why do something so stupid as accept £1000’s in hospitality that makes you look corrupt? Surely an alarm bell rang when Sir Keir was asked did he want to accept a £3,716 box at Royal Epsom? Or maybe it didn’t. Maybe the “win at all costs” excuse is just an excuse.\nFor the record, I’ve taken £0 in expenses and decline hospitality offers. Except one – I was invited, along with my son, to see a play at the Live Theatre. Tickets worth £56. I accepted them, but gave a £100 donation to the Theatre, which is a non-profit organisation. Oh, and I accepted a gift of chocolate sweets, which I donated to the People’s Kitchen.\nBut here’s another question. How are people able to justify this to themselves?\nI doubt Boris Johnson intended to lie to Parliament about holding parties during lockdown. But he had no hesitation justifying his lies to himself. The willingness of cabinet minister after cabinet minister to make ludicrous excuses about Dominic Cummings’s Barnard Castle eye test shows how little moral backbone some of these people have.\nIt’s called Groupthink. A phenomenon detailed by psychologist Irving Janis, while trying to explain why the US made such blunders in Vietnam. Rather than admit failings, people in authority contrive to explain away obvious evidence. The highest morality becomes loyalty to the group or institution, and those who would break ranks are demonised.\nWe’ve seen exactly the same phenomenon in the Spanish FA. It’s bad enough that Luis Rubiales, head of the Spanish Football Association, grabbed world-cup winning footballer Jenni Hermoso by the head and forced a kiss on her lips. They then attempted to bully her into saying it was consensual, and issued a false statement on her behalf. Only when the entire Spanish women’s team resigned did FIFA act and suspend him. UEFA is still silent, and paying Mr Rubiales his Euro 250,000 Euros a year on top of his Spanish salary.\nWhat’s the antidote? I suspect there are many PhDs written by people more qualified than me on organisational culture and groupthink. But in politics, one thing is true: sunlight is the best disinfectant.\nI’m holding public meetings across the North East. You can come and ask me anything you like – within the bounds of decency. The events will be published on my website – JamieDriscoll.co.uk.\nThe first was at Morpeth on Tuesday, and hoping for a good turnout we laid out 80 chairs. In the end 98 locals attended, plus me and my campaign team. Questions about job creation, transport, the climate emergency, and what the North East needs.\nOne local man, Alasdair, summed up the mood. “I think we should have someone [as mayor] who is not party political – it should be people actually looking at the issues, not having a party whip behind them.” If nothing else, it will prevent groupthink.",

From telling folktales around a campfire, to reading to our children at night, it’s innate to human communication.\nCharles Dickens was horrified by the social deprivation in Victorian England. He tried political journalism. He published pamphlets campaigning for social change. But it’s his stories that made the impact. No less a figure than Karl Marx said that Dickens “issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together.”\nA Christmas Carol is a classic example. You know the plot. By relentless hoarding of wealth, Ebenezer Scrooge has pushed everyone away and spreads misery to all he meets. Four ghosts take him on a personal journey from being, well, a Scrooge, to a philanthropist. At its heart, it’s story of fall and redemption. Of showing that you can choose the kind of person you are.\nIt’s A Wonderful Life is another Christmas classic with similar themes. I’ll be watching it again this week, at the Tyneside Cinema with my family. It’s the story of George Bailey, who lives in the idyllic town of Bedford Falls. George gives up his personal dreams to protect his family’s savings and loan business – the American version of a building society. Things go wrong, and he finds himself contemplating his life on a bridge when he is visited by his guardian angel. Like Scrooge, George is shown a vision of an alternative reality. One where George wasn’t around to stand up to the rich banker, Henry F. Potter.\nPotter has taken over the savings and loan. Bedford Falls is renamed Pottersville. Families live in overpriced slums. Sirens blare. Crime and substance abuse are rife. Women work as sex workers. Debt and pawn brokers abound.\nThe film was investigated by the FBI during the McCarthy witch hunts. Apparently, showing the ills of putting greed before social good was “a common trick used by communists”.\nBoth stories show us that when decision making considers only personal enrichment, we all end up poorer. The drive to hoard money corrupts human relationships. These stories from the past are just a fraction of where we are now. The world’s richest 26 people own more than the poorest 50%. Corporations hoard so much money they are buying up their own shares to inflate the prices and enrich their executives.\nBoth Dickens and Capra offer us a choice between two futures. That’s the choice we’ve been wrestling with as a country over the past decade. Since the financial crash, food banks have proliferated, homelessness has skyrocketed, and knife crime has become endemic. Austerity has squeezed household incomes. And the billionaires have made out like bandits. We are most definitely not all in it together.\nThe popular reaction has fuelled the Scottish Independence movement, the rise of socialism in the Labour Party, and a reaction against the status quo that led to Brexit. Few cared about the intricacies of trade agreements or the structure of the European Commission. People were angry that no one was listening.\nI fear we are sliding towards Pottersville. The Prime Minister brazens out corruption, voted through by his MPs. Wages have stagnated, small businesses struggle, public services starved of funding and seen as cash cows for privatisation. Levelling up is bread and circuses. It cherry picks high profile projects while schools go underfunded, and our social care system crumbles. People are paying more tax than ever – no, scratch that. Working people pay more tax than ever. The tax havens remain untouched. And the Home Secretary is making it illegal to protest.\nThat’s the choice. On a personal level you have the freedom to choose what type of person you are. But society can make it easy to be a good person. I’d like to see our country have top quality education and skills training, lots of good well-paid jobs, safe streets, affordable homes, and a good transport system. And all without killing the planet. The money exists. It’s just being hoarded by the few.\nThe story I want to hear is how we turned this around and arrived back at Bedford Falls.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 20 Dec 2021",

Politics is crying out for more honesty.\nCongratulations to every councillor who won, whatever your party. Being a councillor is hard work and underappreciated. Commiserations to all those who lost. Thank you for standing – putting yourself forward takes courage. Without contested elections, there would be no democracy.\nIn case you’ve missed it, Labour did solidly in Tyne & Wear. Press reports that Labour was in danger of losing Sunderland proved to be hype. Sunderland’s Labour council have done some sterling work – and should be rightly proud of being a Real Living Wage employer. That extra £40 a week in low paid workers’ pockets is vital. And reducing poverty saves our public services money in the long run.\nLabour remains solidly in control of South Tyneside, even with some new Greens elected. No net change in North Tyneside. Newcastle and Gateshead haven’t elected a Conservative for 30 years. These are strong results, considering a decade of budget cuts from central government. Councils are strong-armed into putting up council tax or else cut core functions like children’s services to dangerous levels.\nTrying to predict the next General Election from Thursday’s results is like predicting next year’s weather. Yet the commentary is surprisingly uniform. Journalists across the political specturm all have a similar take. Labour is largely where it was in 2018, and Mr Johnson has gone from electoral asset to electoral millstone.\nOne reason Labour hasn’t surged nationally is that Britain’s political discourse is mired in reality TV politics. Wallpapergate, Partygate, Tractor-porn-gate. I’m waiting for a scandal to emerge about a large external door in Parliament, then we can have Gategate.\nThese are serious matters. The PM lying to Parliament would be a resigning matter if there was any honour involved. But it’s detracting from running the country. Labour proposed a Windfall tax to help with energy bills. But how much serious analysis has it had in the news? We rarely get more than a soundbite. That cascades into conversations at dinner tables and pubs, where people are better informed about the PM’s birthday cake than his economic policies.\nIn my election acceptance speech three years ago, I spoke about chaos. The chaos of a private rented sector where people can be kicked out of their home at a month’s notice. The chaotic housing market where our young people can’t afford to live where they grew up. The chaotic transport system where passengers don’t know if the bus will turn up. The chaos small business owners face, who don’t know if corporations will pay their bills. The chaotic funding system for our charities and voluntary sector who don’t know what income they will have from year to year. The chaos working people face, living from week to week, not knowing if they can pay their bills while their debts mount.\nSome people say the Johnson government is chaotic and incompetent. But if their objective is making the rich richer, they are extremely competent. Chaos works in Mr Johnson’s favour. Perhaps Sir Keir should label him Captain Chaos.\nTo cut through requires a plan to deal with the root cause of the chaos: a dog-eat-dog ideology and an economic system that that prioritises the interests of the ultra-rich at the expense of the working people who produce the wealth.\nPeople want to be shown there’s a way out. In a world of galloping poverty, climate breakdown, and global instability, they want some hope. So yes, call out corrupt politicians. But more importantly, we need a vision of a better future.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 9 May 22",

They’ve had a hell of a year. No trading for six months has taken its toll on hospitality and cultural businesses. The self-employed have been hit hardest, with only a fraction of the support of other companies. Over three million self-employed people fell through that gaps of government financial support. Campaign group Excluded UK have been fighting for them.\nSo while there’s much relief to be moving tentatively back to normal, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are carrying a shocking level of debt. The Federation of Small Businesses tells me that the total SME debt across Britain is jaw-dropping £100 billion!\nSmall businesses bring character and individuality to a place. They bring hard financial benefits too. Money spent with local firms recirculates in an area. They buy more local products and services than big corporations. The multiplier effect of buying local, rather than from a corporate chain, creates more local jobs.\nRight at the start of the pandemic, the North of Tyne set up a Covid Response Fund. This was £5 million of emergency funding for local SMEs, to plug gaps in government support. We’ve safeguarded 2,673 jobs over and above the support from central government.\nLast week I spoke to local business owners, including Julie, who co-owns the Mean Eyed Cat in Newcastle. It’s a cracking little pub, loads of character, the sort of place that adds to the vibe of the city. Julie spoke about getting through the past year for her and other micro pubs. It’s been hard. They’ve lost a year. Eat-out-to-help-out didn’t help them. They paid their staff top ups above the furlough rate when they could. Nine people earn their living at the pub.\nThen last autumn, government forced northern businesses to close under the Tier system. They lowered furlough to 67%. It was dicey time for local hospitality businesses. Northern Mayors pushed back against government. Furlough was restored to 80%, and many SMEs gained more support. “We’ve been looking forward to opening up in full, but it’s a pandemic,” she told me. “We need people to be safe … we’re not going to rush to change things, we’re going to move steadily forwards.” Opening up still means a reduced capacity from pre-Covid days, but just as many staff. Every customer gets table service, and every table needs sanitising between customers.\nThe big picture is that Julie’s business is one of the North East’s 40,000 SMEs that form the backbone of our local economy. SMEs account for 48% of our region’s turnover and 50% of the private sector employment. I’m seeing a lot of research and surveys right now. They’re all concluding pretty much the same thing: SMEs in our region face a productivity and sustainability challenge.\nThat’s why we’re putting in £1.6 million of our Digital Growth and Innovation Programme. Hundreds of small businesses will get help to trade online, redesign their operations, and tap in to data science to develop their income.\nWe’re working flat out to make a difference, and credit where it’s due, central government support has made a huge difference, despite the gaps for SMEs and the self-employed. But we’re not out of the woods. The outsourced and centralised test track and trace system has failed again. Local health teams were not given the details of over 700 people infected with the Indian Covid variant. This risks more outbreaks, and reimposition of restrictions. For £37 billion, you’d expect the test & trace system to do the basics. Compare that with the vaccine programme, which has been successful because it was run through the NHS.\nWe’ve put £1.26 million into a Rural Business Growth Fund. Our £3.25 million Culture and Creative Recovery Fund launches in a couple of weeks. Our festivals programme will come online later this year – restrictions allowing. This will create more local activity, creating jobs but also making the North of Tyne a more vibrant place to live. After the past year, I’m sure we’re all looking forward to that.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 24 May 2021",

We are one economic area. The River Tyne does not divide us in any way that matters. We live, work and play all across the North East.\nI’ve been driving this process forward, seeking to secure the best deal possible for the North East. This has been through lobbying and discussions with government ministers across departments including the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the Department for Transport, the Department for Education and the Treasury. I’ve been making the case for more powers in relation to transport, skills, adult education and regional wealth generation mechanisms (fiscal devolution) as the only way to achieve genuine levelling up. Through this hard work, a strong draft deal has now been negotiated with government, which, if post public consultation approval is given by our Local Authority partners, will result in the best per capita settlement of all the combined authorities and unlock £600 million for transport investment.\nThat said, I have already been bringing the region together in important ways. Convening and the soft powers that I have as Mayor can be really powerful.\nWe set up the Tyne Taskforce which brings together the Combined Authority, Local Authorities, MPs, Port of Tyne and the businesses situated along the Tyne. Together we have set out a shared ambition for the Tyne to be a world leader in the offshore and renewable energy sectors.\nI co-chair Net Zero North East. This is a coalition of everybody across our region who’s taking the climate emergency seriously – the public sector, our local authorities, the health service, our businesses, large and small, our community groups. Climate change is one of the most important things we need to work together on. Individuals can make a difference but the scale of the problem demands with we change the way we live on a regional, national, global scale. By working together as a region I’m hopeful that as a region we can be leaders in the green industrial revolution.",

Growing up in a family without enough money has a long-term impact. Pupils who are eligible for free school meals are less likely to go to university than those who aren’t.\nSo why would anyone make a bad situation worse?\nAsk the Government and the Official Opposition. Both support maintaining the two-child benefit cap. A policy that punishes children for having brothers or sisters. Since its introduction in April 2017 it’s affected 400,000 families and 1.4 million children. Those families are missing out on around £3,000 a year for every child they have after the first two.\nEvidence shows the two-child limit has not reduced family sizes. It’s had no impact at all on employment rates. In fact, two-thirds of affected families are already in employment. But it has caused sharp increases in poverty and hardship. Nearly half of children with two or more siblings now live in poverty.\nThis is why I’ve consistently called for the policy to be scrapped. I did so again when I heard directly from people with lived experience at our Policy Truth Commission on Wednesday.\nBut while the welfare state remains under the control of Westminster, devolution gives us a way to fight poverty.\nIf we can get everyone a secure job that pays their bills with enough left over a holiday and some savings, half of our other problems will disappear. With powers over adult skills and local investment decisions we can and do make a difference.\nSometimes people think that jobs magically appear by divine intervention. Or that jobs will appear if you just shout hard enough. But the reality is more complex. It involves working with the private sector to help businesses start up and scale up. It involves programmes designed and funded by my Combined Authority, like Technology, Innovation & Green Growth for Offshore Renewables.\nFortunately it forms the acronym ‘TIGGOR’. And like its near-namesake from Winnie the Pooh it’s full of enthusiasm with people determined to make a difference.\nOn Wednesday I went to the launch of the second round of the programme. We awarded £2.5 million in grants to 9 local companies in round one. Scaling up the technology we need for offshore wind has generated £4.4 million and is expected to create 118 jobs over the next 5 years.\nWe know that the only way to guarantee lower energy prices is to reduce our exposure to the global energy market. In short: to generate more of our energy at home. As an engineer by profession I get this industry.\nWe also know that we will not get to net zero unless we scale up investment in renewable energy. Wind energy now provides 60% of the electricity generated from renewables. It provides more than nuclear, at a fraction of the cost.\nAs with child poverty both Westminster parties have ummed and ahhed about investing in our clean energy future. We haven’t.\nSo we’ve invested in companies like Soil Machine Dynamics (SMD), based in Wallsend. They make subsea robots controlled from the shore. I had a go controlling one. They look like giant, mechanical lobsters with arms and eyes. But it means engineers don’t have to bob up and down on a ship in the middle of the North Sea.\nWe’ve invested in companies like Kinewell Energy, based in North Shields. Who would’ve thought that a business that gets computers to do clever maths would be a success? But it is. Their software helps wind farm engineers account for temperature, terrain, and different loading conditions. It reduces power losses in transmission. It can save 20% on construction costs.\nOur money supports local firms like Cramlington based Transmission Dynamics. Their smart bolts can detect when something is overloaded, and transit the data to an engineer. It increases the life expectancy of wind turbines.\nCentral government keeps stopping and starting green energy programmes. The official opposition can’t decide if it’s investing £28 billion or £0 billion in green infrastructure. But we’re delivering the goods. We’ve even got the old Swan Hunter Yard ready for business again.\nThe North East invented renewable electricity, with hydroelectricity at Cragside, in Northumberland. Thanks to programmes like TIGGOR and TIGGOR 2, we’re growing our green energy industry. I hope it’s a truth universally acknowledged that fighting the climate emergency is good for our planet, good for our economy and good for our people.",

Gillian Anderson’s performance is superb, portraying Mrs Thatcher’s views on Life, the Universe and Everything. People should help themselves, women are too emotional to be trusted, and people should stop waiting for the Nanny State (or anyone else) to help them.\nThatcher’s original Cabinet Ministers – the ‘wets’ – try to tone down her ideas, and warn her it will create devastating levels of unemployment. It’s still quite shocking to hear just how uncaring and compassionless she was.\nMany of us remember the closures of steel works, shipyards, wagonworks and mines. We now know the deep scarring caused by mass unemployment. The fact that our wealth generating industries have been swapped for temporary contracts and the gig economy. The Crown shows what caused the levelling down of the North that we now need to fix.\nAnd it was all built on a false prospectus. “Greed is good” summed up the Thatcher-Regan consensus. The 1987 film Wall Street articulated the idea that greed was natural, efficient, and just and expression of evolution. The idea that if we’re all greedy, then in the long run, we’ll all be better off.\nIt’s lazy thinking. It’s based on the false assumption that life, and the economy, is a zero sum game. That if one person wins, someone else must lose. We all know that the opposite is true. That to thrive and survive, we all have to work together.\nThere’s a great scene in the 2001 Russell Crowe film, a Beautiful Mind. The young John Nash (Crowe) is in a university bar with his mates, trying to work out how to chat up women. They cite Adam Smith: ‘the best result comes from everyone doing what’s best for themselves’. Nash proves that it’s mathematically better to cooperate than compete. The best result comes from everyone doing what’s best for themselves, and what is best for the group. It’s worth a watch on YouTube.\nThatcher’s famously claimed there’s no such thing as society. By this logic, businesses and private enterprises should never invest in infrastructure for the common good. It’s uncompetitive, and would also benefit their rivals.\nThere’s no reason for one supermarket chain to carry the cost of building a road network, if all of the other supermarkets and shops can use it. Or one car manufacturer to set up schools where anyone can learn to read and count. Or write poetry. Or learn history.\nMaybe if all the supermarkets, and car manufacturers, and building firms, and, well, everyone, invested in physical infrastructure (roads, clean water, power grids, sewerage). And also invested in social infrastructure (parks, education, libraries, immunisation programmes), then all the firms would benefit. And so would all of the people working for them.\nOf course, some companies would be tempted to freeload. So why not make the contributions compulsory. And call them tax. And set up agencies that can invest in, and train, staff to take a long-term view on these things. And call them publicly-owned assets. And put them under democratic control. And hey presto! A civilised society that thrives, encourages innovation, and looks after its more vulnerable citizens. In fact, as long as you don’t call it socialism, most people agree with socialism.\nThe socialism I believe in is everyone working for each other, everyone having a share of the rewards. It’s the way I see football, the way I see life.\nBill Shankly, Liverpool FC\nPerhaps the worst aspect of extreme free-market thinking is its short-termism. If we optimise a firm for maximum profit, we’ll see the best outcome. It makes perfect, intuitive sense. And is invariably disastrous in the long term.\nWe all know, as private citizens, that it’s much cheaper to get your car serviced regularly, rather than wait for the engine to seize up on the motorway.\nSo, in fact, do most businesses. It’s myth that most businesspeople are free-market fundamentalists. That’s why the Confederation of British Industry has called for Mayoral Combined Authorities to get long-term, devolved funding streams. Short-term competitive bids for central government funds waste time, money and opportunity.\nThis is the basis of the next devolution deal I’m asking government for. Long term funding, so we can plan. Based on a principle of a clean economy, where no one is left behind.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 23.11.20",

At the moment I’m having to work with a Tory Government which presents its challenges but I do like a challenge!

Mayor Driscoll has the power to raise revenue by charging a council tax precept, but has instead funded 100% of the North of Tyne activities by levering in money from central government and private investment.\nSpeaking before a scheduled meeting of the North of Tyne Combined Authority (NTCA) Cabinet, Mayor Driscoll said:\n“People in the North East are caught in the jaws of a cost-of-living crisis. They don’t need more taxes.\n“We’re often told it’s a choice between taxes or borrowing. As North of Tyne Mayor I’ve raised no taxes and borrowed no money. Instead, I’ve levered in hundreds of millions from private investment to create thousands of jobs, build homes, provide free training courses, tackle child poverty and build the green economy of the future.\n“As Mayor the total amount of tax I have raised from residents is zero pounds and zero pence. The economic growth we create funds all our activities. The NTCA hasn’t cost the taxpayer a penny.\n“The funding we receive from central government is on what’s called a ‘gain share’ model. It’s reviewed by the Treasury every five years, and we have to prove value for money. For every £1 we invest in job creation, over £3 is returned to the Treasury in payroll taxes alone. The organisation I lead is a wealth-generating centre and therefore has no net cost to the taxpayer locally or nationally.\n“People can have confidence that under my leadership the public finances are well managed.”\nRead the article online HERE",

It served him well for a time. But it says more about the 43rd President of the United States attitude to truth than it does about young people in general, few of whom go on to start illegal wars.\nIf you’re in your 20s or younger you’re often in a transitional phase of your life. You might be in full-time education. You might have just started work. You might be doing neither. You might be feeling a bit lost.\nSo what do you do?\nA sensible system of support will find you, give you a map, and help you find your way out.\nThat’s what we’re doing in the North of Tyne.\nI met Brian when I knocked on his door while canvassing. He told me he’d started a community photography course. It gave him a reason to get out of the house. The course made him feel less isolated, less alone. He’d struggled with his mental health, and learning something new helped him recover.\nThere are thousands of people like Brian across the North East.\nPeople who in the jargon are “farthest away from the labour market.” People who find life a struggle and need a helping hand. Perhaps with neurodiversity, or depression, or social anxiety. Or simply low confidence. They might be bright and talented, just not in a good place right now.\nIt’s hard to ‘get on yer bike’ and look for work if you don’t have a bike to start with. Or put another way – you don’t throw someone in at the deep end if they’ve not yet learnt to swim.\nNot everyone wants to go to college. At least not as a first step. They want something more informal, less pressurising. Taught in a familiar setting by people they trust.\nWhich is why we fund organisations like the Workers’ Educational Association – the WEA.\nThis year WEA have provided more than 740 opportunities for people like Brian. With 500 of them – more than two-thirds – delivered as informal community learning.\nWe know they’re working with some of the most disadvantaged people in some of the most disadvantaged communities in our region.\nWe know that their work is helping people build up their confidence and break down barriers to learning and employment.\nAnd we know that independence, self-awareness, and interpersonal skills are all critical.\nThe so-called ‘soft skills’ that are often the hardest to teach. But make the biggest differences to people’s lives.\nWe’ve given learning opportunities for 2,761 under 25s – people like Brian – in the first 6 months of this academic year.\nWith devolution, we wanted to do things differently. Because if at the end of the day the same organisations get the same funding to deliver the same courses to the same students then what was the point?\nThe point of devolution is to use local skills, knowledge and connections – and people – to do a better job managing the Adult Education Budget from the North East rather than from London.\nSo what are we doing differently?\nWell, we put the learners at the heart instead of the courses. We’re not doing ‘Field of Dreams’ here – “If you build it they will come.” There’s no good building something great if no one can get to it. And we know that public transport in the North East – not devolved until May next year I might add – is expensive and unreliable. So we need to get courses to where people live and work.\nThat’s doubly hard in rural Northumberland. But data shows that people from Alnwick, Amble, Berwick, Rothbury, Pegswood, Morpeth, Wooler, Hexham, and Haltwhistle have enrolled on courses we’ve funded. So we’re getting this right.\nAnd when the expanded devolution deal for the North East comes into force in May next year you can expect to see a similar story. Better provision in Sunderland, Gateshead, South Tyneside, and County Durham to match what we’ve achieved in Newcastle, North Tyneside, and Northumberland.\nMost young people are not like George W Bush.

The average household bill will now be £3,549 a year. For three months. Then it will rise again in November.\nI’m sure the great and the good will tell us to turn down our thermostats and wear a jumper. I bet you never thought of that! But you still need to boil your kettle and cook your tea. You still need to shower and turn on your washing machine. If there’s a baby in the house, you need to keep it warm. If you’ve got a chronic chest condition, you need the air warm and dry, not cold and damp.\nAnd if you’re working from home this winter, will your employer compensate you for your energy bills? Will we get a tax break for subsidising the economy from our home-offices?\nIt’s worse for businesses. The price cap only applies to domestic customers. Yesterday I visited a company we’ve helped win a multi-million pound new contract, creating a dozen new jobs. Their energy bill will rise from £900,000 to £3.5 million. An academy trust I heard about will see their bill rise from £1 million to £5 million. Schools, hospitals, Metro trains, the whole fabric of our society is being price gouged. 350% increases on average.\nThe calls for people to huddle in libraries to keep warm this winter is both Dickensian and farcical. Thanks to austerity, my local library is now a community enterprise, run mostly by volunteers. There’s two swimming pools run as social enterprises, how will they cope with rising energy prices? They did everything right – communities stepped up to provide services that should have been funded from taxes, and now they’re getting hammered again.\nWhy does electricity need to jump from 28p kW/h to 52p per kW/h? Only 37% is generated from fossil fuels. The wind turning the wind turbines doesn’t cost any more. Running the EDF owned nuclear plants is no more expensive. The answer is their contracts allow them to.\nThis is an emergency. We saw in Covid that we can act when we need to. Exceptional times warrant exceptional measures. Not only will we see families fall into unpayable arrears, we’ll see businesses fold and people out of work, we’ll see our public services paying their budgets to energy firms, and social enterprises will close their doors just when vulnerable people most need them.\nLong term solutions are needed. Massive investment in offshore wind to electrify Britain and provide abundant cheap energy. Massive insulation of homes. It saves us a fortune. All this is in Labour’s energy security plan. I’d like to see us go further.\nRight now we need an emergency budget. But we do not need to pay £100s of billions to energy suppliers.\nNationalise the energy supply companies. Nationalise the distribution networks. Nationalise the wholesale suppliers and electricity generators. And do it properly, with citizens’ panels scrutinising them, with local authorities advising regulators, and workers from those industries on the board. We can only have energy security when we own it.\nEnough is enough.",

I imagine he meant art can transport us somewhere outside the humdrum and day-to-day. Or perhaps he meant art can bring new meaning and perspectives to our daily existence. Art shows us a new way to interpret our world.\nArt comes in many forms. I love the magic and escapism of the cinema. For our first date, I took my wife, Caroline, to see Pulp Fiction. Not the most romantic movie, I grant you, but we’re still in love 28 years later. It goes to show you never can tell. When I saw the Tyneside Cinema was showing Tarantino’s classic as part of their ‘Big Screen Magic’ programme this summer, I knew we had to go.\n“And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my popcorn!” Apologies to non-Pulp Fiction fans, who might be scratching their heads now.\nCinema can be pure escapism. Transporting us into a completely new world. Out in a galaxy far, far, away with alien creatures and mind-boggling technology. Sometimes, films can bring you back down to Earth with a jarring bump.\nWhen Ken Loach first released Cathy Come Home – a 1966 BBC television play about Britain’s chronic housing shortage – many people thought it was a documentary. It was gritty, unflinching and hard-hitting. It’s impossible to watch the harrowing final scene, where Cathy has her children forcibly removed by Social Services, without being deeply affected. His subsequent films tell stories that feel very close to home. Whether the punitive benefits system of I, Daniel Blake or the inhumane working practices of Sorry We Missed You.\nKen’s latest film, The Old Oak, premiered in Durham and Newcastle last week. It tells the story of TJ Bannatyne, the landlord of a struggling pub in an ex-mining town. When Syrian refugees arrive, it causes tensions within the community. TJ strikes up a friendship with Yara, one of the refugees, and confronts the hostility from the locals – forging a new community along the way.\nIt’s the third consecutive feature film Ken has set and filmed in the North East, giving actors a start, and creating jobs behind the camera. He’s a true friend to the region. 500 people worked on The Old Oak. I’d urge you to go and see it, but caution that it may harm your political career if you’re seen in the same postcode as Ken Loach!\nCinema doesn’t have to be feature-length productions with huge budgets and crews. I recently watched a brilliant short film, Ill Fares the Land, by Patrick Ireland. It follows a young boy in an English coastal town, struggling with trauma, haunted by visions of mermaids and drifting toward the far-right ideology of his older brother. It’s showing at The Star and Shadow on Friday, as part of the North East International Film Festival. I recommend seeing it. The festival itself promises to be a great showcase of filmmaking talent from across the globe.\nArts and culture are often viewed as ‘nice to have’ but not essential. I disagree. I see the huge value artists and creatives bring to our communities and economy. Between 2011 and 2020 our creative industries grew by 68% – the fastest of any UK region – and today contribute more than £1 billion to the local economy annually, employing 46,000 people.\nAs part of our Cultural and Creative Zones initiative, the North of Tyne announced a £1.7million initiative last week to support our burgeoning scene of artists, musicians and filmmakers in Newcastle. And we are doing this right across the region. It’ll help keep our talented North East creatives here, instead of heading to London or Manchester to seek their fortunes. Who knows, the next Sam Fender, Andrea Riseborough or Ridley Scott could be right under our noses.\nI’ve also signed off a further £2 million for our fantastic Cultural and Creative Investment Programme.

But please don’t just walk by – pretty much everyone has a mobile phone these days to call the police.\nWhile most violence is perpetrated by men, it’s not all men. So why are some men so violent, when others find misogyny and violence abhorrent? And what can we do about it?\nSome will have personality disorders that make them unable to feel empathy. Some are badly affected by drug and alcohol problems.\nLong term studies show that traumatic childhood experiences correlate with lifelong effects. Children experiencing parental or domestic abuse, or having a father in prison, or growing up in a home with alcohol or substance abuse have worse life outcomes. This can include boys having a greater propensity to violence. It’s statistical, of course – it would be offensive and wrong to assume that everyone with a tough childhood becomes a dysfunctional adult.\nSadly, services that support children with trauma have been cut to the bone over the past dozen years. As a matter of public policy, if we want to fix it, we have to fund it.\nThat brings us to culture. This is where all men can help, right away, by calling out abusive attitudes and behaviours against women and girls.\nI was fortunate to have these values as part of my childhood. My Mam helped set up the women’s refuge in Middlesbrough back in the 1970’s. I played with the kids of the women in the refuge. I remember being taken by her, as a seven year old, on the very first Reclaim the Night March in Leeds in 1977. That was a response to women being urged to imprison themselves. To curfew after dark because a serial killer was at large. If you can, support this coming Saturday’s Reclaim the Night March in Newcastle.\nWe now have two strapping teenage boys of our own, and I’m humbled by how mindful many young people are to issues of misogyny and gender based violence.\nThis Friday, 25th November, is White Ribbon day. A campaign for men and boys to challenge violence against women and girls. If you see something out of order happen while out or at work or you hear a mate in the pub make a dodgy comment – call it out, if you can, if it’s safe. It’s not ‘banter’, it’s not normal, it’s not okay.\nAnd please join me in making the White Ribbon pledge: “I promise to never use, excuse, or remain silent about men’s violence against women.”\nIt’s time men took responsibility to change this forever.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-parallels-between-levelling-up-and-back-to-basics/content_308.html": "The Parallels Between “Levelling Up” and “Back to Basics”\nFebruary 6, 2022\nDo you remember “Back to Basics”? The John Major version that was satirised by Viz magazine, not the Christine Aguilera album.\nMajor advocated a Britain based on morality and decency, but the campaign was ridiculed when a succession of Conservative politicians were embroiled in scandals. Some lied under oath and eventually went to prison. Despite leading this moral crusade, it later emerged that John Major had an extra-marital affair with Edwina Currie. That’s their business, but Prime Ministers should not set standards for others that they don’t keep themselves…\nThere’s an obvious parallel between “Levelling Up” and “Back to Basics.” We’ve been waiting for the Levelling Up White Paper for 2 years, and it arrived on Wednesday. It contains 12 missions from improving primary education to reducing crime. I’ve never met anyone in any political party who advocates for worse education or increasing crime. The disagreements are about how we achieve it, and where the money comes from. This White Paper doesn’t answer the money question. In fact, it doesn’t even say how much money is needed. It’s more of a wish list, really.\nWhat is significant is the White Paper’s commitment to devolution. It recognises the success of Mayoral Combined Authorities (MCAs) including the North of Tyne. Given that 8 out of 10 MCAs are led by Labour Mayors, that can only be because the evidence backs it up.\nIn the North of Tyne, we’re exceeding our job creation targets by a factor of 4. For every £1 we spend, we lever in over £3 of investment. Every £1 we spend creating jobs returns over £3 to Treasury in increased taxes. The North of Tyne is astonishing value for money.\nI’ve been Mayor for less than 3 years, and along with my local authority colleagues in Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside, we’re delivering more than 4,487 new jobs, saved 2,679 jobs despite the economic impact of Covid, created 28,800 training courses so people can skill-up and earn more, and supported 1,707 businesses with guidance and advice. I want the rest of the region, South of the Tyne, to get the same benefits.\nThe White Paper now officially states the Government position is to expand the Mayoral Combined Authority for the North East. It’s good news – we’re all the same conurbation. And it unlocks £100’s of millions in transport funding.\nTo be a good deal for the North East, it will have to extend our existing North of Tyne funds based on the population of the extended area. There can be no loss of funding on a per-capita basis. I’ve been talking to Treasury, Transport and Local Government ministers for the past two years about this extra devolved funding. It’s now within sight.\nIf we can make it happen, it will bring in well over £1 billion of new money to our region. It is much needed – our local authorities have faced severe cuts over the past decade of austerity. For the record, I still think our local authorities need their full funding restored. Social care, emptying the bins, parks and leisure centres, libraries and street lighting, and so much more is the province of local councils.\nThe role of an MCA is about making the region prosperous across local council boundaries. That means transport across our region – better buses, and expanding the Metro. More firms investing here from outside, and more start ups and scale ups inside our region. More research and development, and making sure the spin off companies are based here. The training programmes to make sure these jobs are available for everyone whatever their background. All based on a green economy, with a thriving cultural scene.\nFor me, levelling up is back to basics. It means nobody needing to use a food bank. Everyone able to get where they want to go, affordably. A secure warm home within everyone’s means. Every parent confident that their children have a good life ahead of them – here, in the North East, if they choose to stay. Travel is great – but we’ll know the North East has levelled up when no one has to move away to earn a decent living.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 7 Feb 2022",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_my-friend-nigel-todd/content_229.html": "My Friend Nigel Todd\nMarch 29, 2021\nI have a packet of Northumberland Wildflower Seeds given to me by Nigel Todd. The mix contains flowers that will thrive in harmony with our local ecosystem. It speaks to his ecological sensitivity and profound sense of place.\nHigh on the wall of Newcastle’s Stowell Street is a stone carving of a sheaf of wheat, a spade and a sickle. “Labor and wait” reads the motto. It’s on the side of the old Co-operative warehouse. “It’s a reminder,” Nigel told me, “that prosperity is about long term sustainability.” The fruits of our labour would take time, and hard graft.\nHis sudden death this weekend has opened a void in my heart. I can only begin to imagine what his family must be feeling.\n“The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born,” wrote Antonio Gramsci. Nigel’s work in Wingrove and Arthur’s Hill was about building that new world. Here and now. In the mess and madness of the old. And he was both a genius and an expert in what he did.\nWhere others would rail at injustice, Nigel acted. He had little patience for vainglorious committee meetings, and once remarked quietly, “we’re just actors in a play that has neither audience nor script.”\nHe was Chair of the Co-operative College. This was never about co-operatives in the abstract. His home was part of a housing cooperative. He was the driving force behind Greening Wingrove , a community cooperative, owned and run by the people who live there.\nThe Bike Garden and the events in Nuns Moor Park are part of that new world. Nigel had been working with the team at the North of Tyne, on our sustainable funding for communities to tackle climate change and food poverty. Everything from vertical veg growing to generation of clean community energy was in the mix.\nTommy Tankie, his topiary steam train sculpted from privet, brightened up the terraced street right outside his home. Talking about it would raise that characteristic smile of warmth and sparkle of gentle subversion in his eyes.\nNigel served his community as a Newcastle City Councillor since 1980. I asked his advice before I became a councillor. “I’ve always taken the approach,” he told me, “that a councillor should not be a cheerleader for the council out in the community, but a shop-steward for the community inside the council.” I hope the Labour Party honours Nigel’s commitment to democracy by allowing local members to select their candidate for May’s elections.\nHe held a total belief in shared humanity across race, gender and ethnicity. Greening Wingrove uses the “Rainbow Ward” logo as a symbol of its diversity. He campaigned for international justice, and visited Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, and educational trips to Auschwitz.\nHis daughter Selina wrote that “like most children in the so-called post-war ‘golden age’ of social mobility, Nigel failed his eleven-plus examination and attended a secondary modern school until the age of fifteen.” And owed his education to the Labour movement. “In his late teens he became a clerk for the Workers Educational Association, an adult education organization founded by trade unionists and socialists in 1903. The WEA sent him to Ruskin College, a trade union-funded adult education college in Oxford, where he met my mother.”\nA historian and adult educator by profession, he published three books. For him, education was about enrichment. It was history from below – not the kings and queens, but the ordinary heroes on the front line.\nIn Excited Times is about Tyneside’s struggles against the Blackshirts and British Fascism. Indeed I first met Nigel thirty-odd years ago as part of TWAFA – the anti-fascist movement. At that time there was a spate of violent attacks on anti-racist campaigners from organised fascist groups. I remember teaching Nigel some self-defence techniques. It’s fair to say his talents lay in other forms of struggle.\nHe was a gifted storyteller. He had that gentle, “gather round and listen” voice, and an air of infectious calm. Nigel never sought glory or recognition. But he was a legend and a giant. With wise counsel and subtle wit he was mentor to so many.\n“He was just so calm, all the time. I always found that remarkable and so unusual. He was one of the first people to welcome us into politics and I think nearly every socialist would be able to say the same.”\nNigel spent his life planting seeds, and watching them bloom.\n(First published in The Chornicle and The Journal on 29th March 2021)",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-if-its-a-big-hoax-and-we-create-a-better-world-for-nothing/content_111.html": "“What if it’s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?”\nDecember 17, 2023\n“No doubt there will be lots of cheering and back-slapping… but the physics will not care.”\nSo said one scientist about the COP28 global climate agreement. “Transitioning away from fossil fuels” is already happening. Slowly. The UK’s first offshore wind turbines were installed in December 2000, near Blyth.\nIt’s not whether we’re “transitioning away” from fossil fuels that matters. It’s how fast.\nI was an engineer working in Blyth at the time. Fast forward 23 years, and last Monday, I was in Blyth again, evaluating our TIGGOR programme. Technology Innovation and Green Growth in Offshore Renewables has nothing to do with Winnie the Pooh. Except for having lots of energy. It’s creating 118 direct jobs in the offshore technology, and hundreds more in the supply chain. Remote vehicles. Advanced software. Increased reliability and safety systems. I met two of the women working on the projects.\nEvery disaster movie you’ve ever watched has the same basic conflict. Can the characters escape the volcanic lava or killer bees in time?\nIn 2016 the world signed the Paris Climate Agreement. To keep global heating to below 1.5 degrees. Otherwise we’ll see crop failures, floods, and desert encroachment across the world. It’s worrying, then, that in November the temperature had risen 1.75 degrees. Food bills are already £100s a year more expensive because of climate damage. You can’t negotiate with nature. Actions speak louder than words.\nTransport produces one third of the North East’s greenhouse gas emissions. In my 2019 manifesto I promised I’d unite the North East into one Mayor Combined Authority so we could get transport regulation devolved. I’ve kept that promise, and from May next year, if re-elected, I’ll create a Total Transport Network.\nFully integrated buses, trains and Metros. Where one ticket will take you your entire trip. On-demand transport in rural areas so they’re not out in the cold. With guards on trains to tackle anti-social behaviour. Integrated with safer cycling – away from busy roads where possible – and more pleasant walking routes. Greater accessibility for disabled people and parents with buggies. With an expanded car club so everyone can access a car without expensive vehicle ownership. And free transport for under-18s.\nHow can anyone argue against cleaner, faster, safer transport?\nThriving local shops and services help too. Sometimes called 15- minute cities, so you can buy a pint of milk or a newspaper locally. Or see a GP or post a parcel, without having to traipse across half the city.\nFor years people have campaigned to keep local services open. Yet now there are conspiracy theorists arguing against their right to buy tin foil within walking distance of home.\nThe public are sick of half-baked arguments and half-hearted solutions. I spoke to a young woman on Saturday. Intelligent and well informed, a biomedical scientist. She wants social justice and a sustainable future.\n“In the general election, I don’t want to waste my vote. It’s really a tactical choice to keep out the Conservatives,” she said. “The trouble is I don’t believe Labour will do much either.” Polls show the vast majority of Britons agree with her.\n“What about the Mayoral election?” I asked.\n“That’s different. You’re electing one person,” she said. “And you can win and actually make a difference.”\nShe’s right. Prime Ministers are not elected by the public. They’re elected by their MPs.\nIn a Mayoral election, though, every vote counts equally. You directly elect the Mayor, not party representatives. Their skills, integrity and experience determine whether things get done.\nTake retrofit. Insulating buildings and installing low-carbon heating such as air-sourced heat pumps.\nWe’ve already surveyed the entire North of Tyne Housing stock. 140,000 homes are particularly energy inefficient. Retrofitting them would create around 3,500 good jobs. But cost upwards of £7 billion. Add in Durham, Sunderland, Gateshead and South Tyneside and those figures more than double.\nOnce you exclude transport, education and other budgets, the new Mayor has a flexible budget of £48 million a year. If we spent our entire investment fund on this one project it would take us 331 years to complete it.\nWe need a Mayor who can get results faster.\nLike negotiating with Government for the power to regulate the private rented sector. We could then require privately-rented homes to be insulated and have affordable, low-carbon heating. I’d then advance the cash up-front, and property owners could pay it back overt decades from their increased property values and energy savings.\nThat’s how we get things done.\nLike the 1,500 people across the North East doing green skills bootcamps this year. Free, flexible courses, like learning to install air-sourced heat pumps or maintain electric vehicles.\nThat’s the local Green New Deal in action. I shared a panel with Sian Berry, former leader of the Green Party, last week. According to research, the people of Brighton want the same things as the North East. Affordable public transport. Safer active travel. Fewer cars on the road. More green spaces. And warmer homes.\nExcept for going vegan. Geordies were less keen than Brightonians. I mentioned that we did invent the vegan sausage roll, though.\nIt’s as if that climate summit cartoon listing the co-benefits from tackling the climate emergency has come to life.\n“Energy independence, preserved rainforests, clean water, clean air, healthy children…” and a man in the audience says, “What if it’s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_hunger-in-the-uk/content_156.html": "Hunger in the UK\nJune 22, 2020\nPoliticians are terrified of U-turns. They look indecisive.\n200,000 kids have had to skip meals because their family couldn’t afford enough food during lockdown. Yet thanks to England footballer Marcus Rashford, 1.3 million kids will now get fed this summer. When the cupboards are bare, that £15-a-week voucher will stop kids becoming malnourished.\nFor the record, I won’t berate the government for doing what is obviously the right thing. As economist John Maynard Keyes used to say, “When my information changes, I change my mind. What do you do?”\nBut what new information came to light? Only 24 hours earlier, Boris & the No 10 team had publicly rejected the proposal. They sent out ministers to do the media rounds backing their decision.\nSouth Shields MP Emma Lewell-Buck lined up 50 MPs to sign a cross-party letter pressing the government to take action. The prospect of Marcus Rashford’s campaign coinciding with a backbench rebellion forced the U-turn.\nThis wasn’t a rational re-evaluation of the facts. It was political and public pressure.\nSo how is government deciding its policy? If it’s responding to social media likes, can we expect a minister for dogs that look like celebrities?\nWe have to end this back of a fag packet approach to food insecurity.\nHunger is the everyday reality for many families in the UK.\nA 2017 report by the Food Foundation showed 11% of kids in the UK live in a “severely food insecure household”. This is by far the worst situation in Europe. The UK is put to shame by much poorer countries in Eastern Europe. Even Greece, with all its economic woes, has only 2% of kids in food insecurity.\nThe government continues to see hunger and food security as an “overseas issue.” Not my words, but the damning assessment of the January 2019 House of Commons Environmental Committee. The government is failing to meet the UN’s International Sustainable Development Goals on hunger.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on household finances. Research by the Food Foundation shows food insecurity in households with children has doubled since last year.\nSustain, the Alliance for Better Food and Farming, estimates there are now 8.4 million people in the UK struggling to get enough to eat. Behind this grim statistic, food insecurity means kids going to school malnourished and unable to focus on their lessons. Parents are going without food so their children can eat. In work poverty means half of all food bank aid goes to working households. The unemployed, older, disabled and BAME people are also particularly at risk.\nWe need to treat food poverty as a public health emergency. It causes under-nutrition and obesity in children. The cheapest foods are nutrient poor but calorie-rich. This has life-long health consequences.\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Investing to stop food poverty yields huge savings down the line. Obesity related illness costs the NHS over £16 billion a year. Wider costs, including time off work, will cost the UK £50 billion a year by 2050. These are the government’s own figures, from Public Health England.\nThere is a way to address this, at least locally. In Newcastle, 30% of schoolchildren are on free school meals. We’re already tackling in-work poverty through our Good Work Pledge. When workers are paid decent wages they can afford to feed their families. No one should need the indignity of charity to put food on the table. Frankly, government should just adopt our Pledge and make it national policy.\nLater this year the Devolution White Paper will be published. Current government policy is exclusively focussed on growth. But that growth is leaving too many people behind.\nGiving the North of Tyne the powers and funding to tackle poverty will boost productivity and improve educational attainment. It will save Treasury a fortune down the line. Marcus Rashford brought the harsh reality of hunger in the UK to our attention. We must now tackle the root cause. We must unlock children and families from poverty.\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 22.6.20",

I will make public transport faster, more reliable, and more comprehensive. I’ll make sure the whole fleet is upgraded and easier to use for disabled people; stations too. Everyone from 8 to 80 should feel safe on public transport. This will mean having guards on trains. I’ll take a firm line on anti-social behaviour and ban repeat offenders. Click on the bullet points above for more.\nThe North East invented powered public transport. The Rocket and Locomotion1 were built at the Forth Street works by the Tyne. Yet since deregulation in October 1986 our transport system has declined and fewer people use it. It’s time to turn this around and build a transport system to be proud of.\nIn the North East, our two million people spend £3 billion a year on private transport – most of it on owning and running cars. On average that’s £1500 a year for every man, woman and child. 96.4% of our cars are still fossil fuelled.\nWe have 861,000 cars in the North East and 186,000 households own two cars. If you can get to work or to college easily; if you can get your goods delivered, if you can go on a night out without needing a car – why would you own two?\nI’ve been a public transport policy geek since I wrote a dissertation on an environmentally friendly, fully integrated public transport system back in 1993, as part of my degree. As Mayor I represent our region on Transport for North. I’ve shaped our North East Transport plan. And I’ve had dozens of meetings with transport ministers to get us this new funding. So when I say we can build a low-carbon transport system that is so good that thousands of people will voluntarily give up owning cars, I’m confident we can do it.\nUnder my leadership every town and every village in County Durham will be part of the Total Transport Network from the first day it’s set up.\nDurham joined the devolution deal late, after the LibDem led coalition explored a county devolution deal. Durham will benefit in the next capital funding round, and immediately from the bus improvement money. Durham will be a major beneficiary from reopening the Leamside Line. Under my leadership Durham’s transport will fully integrate with the rest of the North East without any delay.\nIf Durham had struck a county deal instead of joining the North East, there would be no transport money now or later, just as there isn’t in Cornwall or North Yorkshire’s county deals.",

Ancient Biblical tribes appeased their gods to secure their prosperity. Medieval theocracies imposed religious purity, to secure rewards in the next world.\nEarly industrial European nations focused on expanding empires. More land was better – or so their political philosophy said.\nThe pre-war Soviet bloc was obsessed by industrial output; it would solve all their problems. For the past few decades, economic growth has been our Holy Grail. All public and corporate policy is subservient to getting people to spend more and more money.\nIn every century, those who question the received wisdom are heretics. But I have to question the wisdom of endless growth on a finite planet.\nWhat does growth mean to a thirteen-year-old, choosing her GCSE subjects, while worried about the climate crisis destroying civilisation?\nHow would we explain the necessity of economic growth to the people we see sleeping in shop doorways?\nWhat does growth mean to a care worker juggling two jobs on minimum wage who never gets to read her daughter a bed-time story?\nOr the owner of a small business who is about to go bust because a large corporate customer still hasn’t paid their invoice, 120 days after it was due.\nOr to parents who are financially secure, but worried about their son being the next victim of knife crime?\nI’m growth agnostic. Growth can achieve a lot – but it must be a means to an end, and not an end in itself. The economy has grown in the last ten years. So has homelessness.\nI’m not agnostic about profit. I want businesses to be profitable. It’s what you do with that profit that counts. If it’s reinvested in the productive economy, that’s good. If firms are using their profits to look after their people, and develop their talents and morale and productivity, that’s great. If firms are using it to innovate and develop cleaner, more sustainable ways of working, that’s brilliant. But if it’s disappearing off into a tax haven, then that’s unsustainable. It’s bad for the workforce, it’s bad for the environment, and it sucks money out of our region.\nThat’s why devolution is so important. It is only by working closely with a place-based approach that we can really influence lived experience. Our proximity informs our judgement. We have to talk to the people who are affected. We have to see the places day by day. Above all, we have to co-design our policies with the people they affect. That cannot be done from Whitehall.\nWe must stop worshipping growth. We must start making policy by wellbeing. Does it make people happier? Safer? Does it give us security? Does it make us healthier? Can the future sustain it?\nThere’s whole books on this subject – I’d recommend Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics. But in a short newspaper column, a story might be better.\nTwo economists, Sue and Joe, are out for a walk in the wilderness.\n“Sue, I’m hungry,” says Joe. “I’ll give you £50 if you climb that tree and see if any of the fruit is ripe.”\nSue accepts. None of the fruit is ripe. A branch snaps and she comes plummeting down, collecting bruises along the way.\nTen minutes later, they see another tree. “Your turn, Joe,” says Sue. “This time I’ll give you £50 if you climb up to see if there’s any ripe fruit.”\nJoe climbs, gets scratched and scraped, but finds no ripe fruit.\n“Well that was a waste of time,” says Joe. “We both got hurt, we damaged the trees, and we’re still hungry.”\nSue replies, “At least we grew the economy by £100.”\nThis article was first printed in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 13th January 2020",

I’m not seeking out new life and new civilisations. I’m aiming to make ours better.\nWe all know the story. Our region fuelled the industrial revolution. The workshop of the world. Home of the locomotive. Birthplace of the railways. Supplier of ships to the world. Where renewable energy, electric light and turbine power were invented.\nAnd then a rapid decline from the early 1980s – with the North East’s GDP per capita plummeting from 93% of the UK average in 1981 to 73% by 2017. No other English region has suffered this decline.\nThe reason is simple: long term under-investment. Investment in businesses, investment in infrastructure, and investment in our people.\nThe answers to the economic problems of the North East lie in generating more wealth here. This creates a virtuous circle of better health and higher skills, which in turn leads to greater prosperity.\nIf we can get everyone a secure job that pays their bills with enough left over a holiday and some savings, half of our other problems will evaporate. People with financial security live longer, healthier, more productive lives. Educational attainment rises and crime falls.\nEven the Government seems to know this. When the North of Tyne Combined Authority was set up the Government gave us one main target: create 10,000 new jobs over 30 years.\nWe’re already creating 4,832 jobs under my captaincy. 14 years’ progress in 4 years. A decade ahead of the Government’s schedule. If anyone ever tells you Labour can’t run the economy, send them to me.\nBut I want us to go further and faster.\nThere are 68,775 people claiming unemployment-related benefits in the North East. We know that’s not the full picture – many more are economically inactive. And a quarter of those in work are in insecure, zero-hours, or temporary jobs, including bogus self-employment.\nSo we need more jobs, but crucially more good jobs. Jobs compatible with tackling the climate emergency, not ones paving the road to Armageddon.\nOur Good Work Pledge now covers more than 50,000 employees in the North East.\nOur advanced award requires employers to pay the Real Living Wage, recognise trade unions, build a balanced and diverse workforce, support career progression, and ban repressive practices like fire and rehire.\nWe developed it with the trade unions and enlightened employers and it underpins all of our investments and job creation.\nBut if underinvestment is the problem, how do we fix it with a government that still believes in austerity and an economy full of hedge funds after a quick buck?\nWe face a choice.\nAllow hedge funds and private equity to extract wealth from places like ours, while they dodge their taxes on the way.\nOr find new ways to get socially productive investment into the North East.\nThat’s why the North of Tyne Combined Authority has set up the Venture North fund. This is a totally groundbreaking approach where we become the venture capitalists – but invest ethically.\nWe’re starting with a £50 million pot. The North of Tyne is putting in £10 million, with a further £40 million from universities and pension funds. Pension funds are our money, remember – the returns flow back to us, not to billionaires.\nWe’ll invest in scale-up and start-up companies in the North East, including those that come out of our universities. So we’ll part own them. Our bright talents will no longer have to go to London, Oxford or Cambridge to start their businesses, in sectors like net zero, health technology, and life sciences.\nThe wealth generated by this fund will stay here, in our region, and be recycled to create more jobs.\nThis week I’m talking to more pension funds about investing here. In time I want to get this fund up to £500 million. By then it will create around 14,000 jobs and generate hundreds of millions of profit for us to reinvest in our region. That’s Community Wealth Building on steroids.\nMaking the North East prosperous again – that’s somewhere worth boldly going.",

That’s the £4,266 question. If we don’t understand why they’ve gone up, we won’t choose the right solutions to bring them down again.\nGas prices spiked before Russia invaded Ukraine. Global energy demand surged as Covid restrictions relaxed. Then Russia’s squeeze on gas supplies, and profiteering by speculators, drove wholesale prices higher. Britain imports 56% of our gas, and our pipelines are connected to Europe’s. So British wholesale prices pretty much track the rest of Europe.\nBut we’re also more exposed to global market swings than our near neighbours. Most of our homes are heated by gas and around 37% of our electricity is generated by gas-fired power stations. We have some of the oldest and leakiest buildings in Europe. And the fact Britain lacks gas storage capacity means that when the world sneezes, we get cold.\nThe mix changes from day to day, but roughly 20% of our electricity comes from nuclear, and 43% from renewables. But the market is set up so wholesale prices for nuclear and much renewable electricity track the gas prices. You might think that means that energy companies are raking it in. You’d be right. Their costs are no higher than last year, but we’re being squeezed until our pips squeak.\nSo what needs to happen?\nFirst, it’s a crisis, so act now. Domestic energy, petrol, food, imported goods – all are going up. The obvious answer is to give people an inflation-proof pay rise. The wage-price spiral is a scare story from people who want a low-wage Britain. Energy and food prices are not high because rail workers want a fair pay rise.\nLet’s uprate benefits and pensions too. Pay for it with a windfall tax, and move towards a wealth tax. A wealth tax would raise around £130 billion every year, and boost economic investment.\nEnergy prices affect businesses too. We need to get the price down sharpish. So let’s regulate the price that wholesale suppliers can charge – it’s an emergency. If they don’t want to trade on that basis, politely offer to take them into public ownership.\nIn France, President Macron has stopped household bills rising by more than 4%. By fully-nationalising the French energy company EDF – already 86% state-owned – with the French Government absorbing the costs.\nWho owns Britain’s nuclear power plants? EDF Energy. Much of our electricity generation is already nationalised. By France. Just like our buses and train companies are owned by foreign governments. Take back control, anyone?\nSecond, we need a long-term solution as well as a quick fix. Otherwise we’ll face this problem every winter. Public ownership alone is not enough.\nWe need rapid and massive investment in renewables. And build them in Britain. We know how. In the North of Tyne we’re investing £25 million in offshore wind – 15% of our budget. If the Government matched that percentage it’d be spending £169 billion a year. It’s actually spending £285 million.\nHeat pumps and electric vehicles will increase electricity demand. With a massive offshore wind project, we could have super cheap electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, no one has to pump the wind out of the ground. When it’s windy, and supply exceeds demand, use electrolysis to make zero-pollution hydrogen. On a calm night, when there’s no sun or wind, use the hydrogen to replace natural gas.\nAnd those leaky buildings won’t fix themselves. Let’s invest in a massive retrofit programme. Nearly half the North of Tyne’s housing stock isn’t energy efficient enough. 140,000 homes need to be retrofitted. That’d create 3,500 local green jobs. We’ve done the planning, we can get cracking straightaway if Government work with us.\nThe long-term solution adds up to energy independence. Britain’s a windy island with a massive shoreline. Let’s use it.\nOur Government is doing nothing. And doing nothing is a deliberate choice. The Founding Fathers of the United States didn’t want to be subjected to foreign tyrannies. Neither should we.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_beyond-the-headlines-in-brighton/content_276.html": "Beyond the Headlines in Brighton\nOctober 3, 2021\nIt’s two years since I started writing this column in The Journal and The Chronicle. In that time we’ve had a general election, a global pandemic, a change in Labour leader, and Britain has left the EU.\nThen, as now, I’d just returned from Labour Conference in Brighton. And then, as now, the reality is different from the TV clips.\nThe Conference Hall that you see on TV is the nexus of the conference. There’s motions, and rule change debates, and the big speeches from the main stage. The Party managers are concerned about the headlines, of course, and how the leader’s speech gets reported.\nBut that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The conference centre holds dozens and dozens of exhibition stands. Trade Unions, think tanks, charities, businesses and journalists. It’s fascinating to see the TV and radio stations. They really do create pop up studios. It’s hard to walk far without appearing in someone’s shot.\nFor every news headline, there’s two dozen fringe events spread across Brighton, a hundred private meetings huddled around tables in hotel bars, and politicians and advisors scurrying around finishing speeches on a just-in-time basis. I became very familiar with the venue security check and bag search.\nI arrived on Sunday evening. A few meetings and catching up with people I hadn’t seen in person for two years, before a back-to-back couple of days, with meetings from 8am to late. Conference is the only time it is acceptable to propose a 10pm meeting!\nOn Monday morning I bumped into Andy McDonald at breakfast. As a North East MP, we’ve got to know each other over the years. We discussed his New Deal for Working People. It’s a great piece of work that lays out in detail how we change employment law to benefit Britain’s 31 million working people, and still enable good employers to thrive. It includes a proposal for everyone to be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay.\nLater that day, Andy resigned – unhappy at being told to argue against proposals he was advocating. Ambitions and headline policies are one thing, but any credible government has to know how to deliver the detail. Andy will be a loss to the Labour front bench.\nMy first meeting was an interview with the Financial Times – how do we level up places like the North East? My answer – generate more wealth here. That means investment. We’re creating thousands of good green jobs at the North of Tyne. But with more financial tools, we can really start to eradicate unemployment and poverty wages.\nThen off to a fringe at The World Transformed on Community Wealth Building. On the panel were three other Labour politicians in power, who are also creating jobs, keeping money in their local economies, and tackling economic inequality. I spoke about “guerrilla economics” – how it is possible (just) to make a local difference even when Government starves our regions of funding. Most encouraging was a well informed audience of Labour people in local government making a difference.\nThen a series of meetings with Union General Secretaries, and the new Director General of the CBI. Conference is an efficient opportunity to meet lots of people one after the other. Zoom has its uses, but it’s not the same as face-to-face meetings.\nMore panels – Community Wealth Building with shadow ministers, Tackling Regional Economic Inequalities with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. And a fascinating panel with Andy Burnham and John McDonnell on a fairer taxation model to replace Council Tax.\nIn between were media interviews. Cross questions on LBC in a makeshift studio discussing the topical issues including Andy’s resignation (sad), party unity (essential) and the fuel crisis (totally avoidable). My favourite question was from Tyne Tees TV’s Tom Sheldrick: should Labour conference be held in Newcastle. An enthusiastic “Yes”.\nLastly I met up with fellow Metro Mayors Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham for a couple of hours (in the bar) and later Sadiq Khan joined us. Then some late night and early morning Combined Authority business from my hotel room on the overburdened hotel Wi-Fi.\nAll before heading off on Tuesday evening to Manchester, for the Transport for the North meeting on Wednesday morning.\n*Originally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 04 Oct 2021",

A load of my twenty-something martial arts friends joined in. To get maximum points, you had to do twenty pull-ups, one hundred sit-ups in two minutes, and run three miles in 18 minutes. Maybe it was a midlife crisis. It was certainly cheaper than buying a Porsche.\nI could bang out the pull ups and sit ups. But I was more of a slow plodder, listen-to-a-podcast enjoy-the-scenery kind of runner. So I started training for speed. And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get my time down to the target.\nSo on a late September morning, rain coming down in stair rods, I psyched myself up. Four laps and a bit round Freeman Field. I had a GPS pacing watch (definitely cheaper than a Porsche) and off I set. First lap, hard work, but on course, rain cooling me down. Second lap finished, and I’m struggling. Heart pounding, legs getting heavy, but focused.\nInto the third. Keeping the pace up on the long downhill, and turning onto the flat. And my body is saying stop. But resolve kicks in. I’m determined, and I push through the pain. And my heart beats in my ears and my legs give out and I stumble and I crash and slide headlong in the mud. And lie there on my back. In a puddle four inches deep, breathing like a steam engine.\nAnd I was happy. I was happy because I knew I’d hit my limits. It wasn’t effort, or determination that let me down. It was that I’m human. And humans have limits. I’m not built like Haile Gebrselassie, and no amount of training was ever going make me run like him.\nI grew up in a working class family in a rough part of Middlesbrough. My Dad was a shiftworker at ICI. It’s fair to say we didn’t have a lot of money, but there was never any doubt that there was enough to eat. I was fortunate enough that when I went to university in my twenties, tuition was free.\nI’ve never been raped. Or racially abused. Or been trapped in an abusive relationship. I’ve never had drug or alcohol problems. I’ve never suffered from mental ill health. I’ve never had to struggle to find a job because I’ve been in prison. I’ve never seen my career suffer because I’ve had to take time off for cancer treatment. I’ve never had to choose between paying the bills and getting my kids a Christmas present.\nResilience is all about having a reserve of energy to call on. I can only imagine how exhausting it is to face life’s challenges when you’ve had to run three laps before the race even starts.\nWe’re entering a tough time. The world economy will slow. Unemployment here will rise. I’m not going to restate my views on the government’s handling of Covid. The truth is, we’ll all find our reserves being tested.\nSome people talk of a competitive labour market. Survival of the fittest. A race to the bottom. No.\nBecause one place you shouldn’t be getting grief from is work. That’s why the North of Tyne has made Good Work our number one priority.\nWe’ll use public procurement to increase the quality of jobs here. Our Good Work Pledge requires employers to reward people fairly – paying the Real Living Wage. And no exploitative contracts. Good employers will develop a balanced workforce, with diversity. They’ll provide training so people can progress. They’ll work with trade unions. They’ll show social responsibility through positive environmental practices. And they’ll look after their workers’ wellbeing and mental health.\nWise employers know their workforce is their biggest asset. Look after your workers, and they’ll be more productive, more innovative, and more loyal. We will acknowledge good employers who look after their staff. And give other employers a leg up to match that standard.\nDetermination is a wonderful quality. But some of us are already running to stand still. We cannot go back to the economy we had before this crisis. No more stripping everything down to the lowest cost. We must rebuild for resilience.\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 20.7.20",

Of particular note are flour and seeds. Both are products that need time and patience to use. We’ll ignore crisps, alcohol and toilet roll for now. Although if the lockdown lasts a lot longer maybe we’ll see a rise in homemade hooch.\nIs it because many of us suddenly find ourselves with more time on our hands? Maybe we always wanted to spend more time gardening or baking, but we didn’t have the opportunity. Across the population it seems it’s all or nothing. Either you are an essential worker, throwing yourself in to the massively important tasks that enable us all to get through this. Or suddenly finding yourself with more time on your hands.\nI think Boris Johnson comes into both categories. If you haven’t seen the astonishing article in The Times, our Prime Minister skipped five consecutive Cobra meetings on the crisis. He went on holiday instead. Calls to order protective gear were ignored. Scientists’ warnings fell on deaf ears. At 5,000 words it’s too long to comment on here, but it’s buzzing around on social media. Check it out. The catalogue of failures is mind boggling.\nFor those who aren’t leading a country of 67 million people, I say make the time count. And it looks like people are. Baking with the kids. Growing veg for the first time. Or finally having time to practice a musical instrument. And do it as often as you know you should if you ever want to play something more complex than Smoke on the Water. (My 12 year old son now does a great James Bond theme on his guitar!)\nA benefit that time gives us is changing the way we shop. Being able to walk to your local greengrocer, butcher or general store (where they’ve been able to stay open). You might have watched the recent show on the BBC called Back in Time for the Corner Shop. It showed how corner shops have changed over the last 100 years. From being the centre of the community, with the shop keeper weighing out all the produce, to self-service and the impact of the supermarkets. The last episode showed modern local shops with a happy medium between speed and friendly personal service.\nThe satisfaction of making something with your own hands is part of the human condition. This is not a new idea. Thinkers from Karl Marx to the Dali Lama have spoken of mindfulness and the alienation of labour. The idea that humans take pleasure in creating and achieving. As Pablo Picasso said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.”\nIn the Star Trek film Insurrection (bear with me here) the Enterprise crew find themselves on a planet which appears to be lacking technology. The colony’s leader explains, “We have chosen not to employ [our technology] in our daily lives. We believe that when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man.” In an otherwise unremarkable film, this stands out as prophetic. How the world will bounce back from this crisis gives us a choice. A thug can use a knife to wound. A surgeon can use a knife to heal. Likewise, automation can put people out of work and into a precarious future. Or it can provide the time for us to develop our innate human creativity. I think we’re approaching a Beveridge moment. We need a public debate on Universal Basic Income.\nWe need a balance between humans and technology. Technology is essential for prosperity and sustainability – from broadband to vaccines. The burden we’re placing on our planet’s resources requires a less materialistic way of life. Our relationships, physical and mental wellbeing must be valued more than consumption. Our work-life balance needs recalibrating. All of us deserve the time to take a walk, use our hands, and make time for the things that make us human.\nFirst printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 20.4.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_creating-jobs-need-not-cost-the-earth/content_328.html": "Creating Jobs Need Not Cost the Earth\nDecember 12, 2021\nThe link between our financial system and tackling climate change is not an obvious one. Post-COP the whole world gets the urgency of reducing emissions towards zero.\nBut how? There are big-ticket items, like building a multi-gigawatt wind farm on the Dogger Bank. Building a gigafactory to electrify Britain’s vehicle fleet. Things that are happening right now, with our region at the leading edge.\nBut if you’re not a multi-billion pound company, what can you do?\nThis is where our Green New Deal comes in.\nI’m often asked questions like – “I want to fit solar panels on the roof of my factory, can you help?” The answer is now yes, apply to our Green New Deal Fund. Businesses can apply for loans, grants and equity for projects between £200k and £2 million. Not just businesses, also education institutions, social housing providers, not-for-profit organisations and local authorities.\nThe types of projects could include community energy schemes, electric vehicle charging points, retrofitting buildings to stop wasting heat, small scale renewables, or low carbon heating. Sometimes working with nature is the best way to take carbon out of the atmosphere, be that rewilding, or restoring upland peat bogs. This is the most exciting bit for me: I can’t wait to see the imaginative projects the people of North of Tyne develop.\nThey key thing here is that most projects never get off the drawing board. It’s easy to imagine more sustainable ways to do things. But where does the money come from? We’ve done the work and crunched the numbers to figure out where we can get most bang for our buck. Our Green New Deal Fund will predominantly be loans and grants that projects will repay from their successes.\nThe money we have is public money. We need to account for every penny. This means robust approval and reporting processes. I take this very seriously, it’s what accountability means. If we did every project as a standalone, bespoke piece of work, my staff would be buried under a mountain of paper (or the electronic equivalent – a mountain of bytes). This is where funds come in.\nBy working with project owners – public, private or community – we’ll help them identify where they can generate revenue. It might be from energy savings. Or selling electricity. Or developing new products. Or subsidies for restoring nature.\nThe barrier for most projects is that capital is expensive. If you need to borrow from a bank, at a commercial rate, your sums probably won’t add up. Global corporations have mountains of cheap cash, but only deploy it when they can extract a return for their shareholders. Small, local projects just can’t compete. Our fund levels the playing field. It makes it possible for community energy and rewilding to happen. Without having to pay for the profits of financers – often based in tax havens – they only need to repay their costs. By making the money available as patient capital, or favourable loans, we can channel money to do public good.\nFor every £4,525 invested, a project must save at least one tonne of carbon dioxide per year. And for energy efficiency projects it must reduce energy costs by at least 10%. But it also supports skilling people up for green jobs, encourages innovation and creates a region we are proud of.\nOf course, the cost of not dealing with the climate emergency is even greater. Central Government needs to step up, and invest properly in sustainable housing, in retrofitting buildings, and in clean public transport.\nBut our Green New Deal will grow. Every project we fund will repay the money in time, so we can spend it again and again. And once we’ve established a pipeline of projects, we can lever in more money and fund more projects, in a virtuous circle. Every job, and every tonne of carbon counts. It’s by paying attention to the small business and community ecosystem that enables us to achieve so much extra.\nThe North of Tyne Green New Deal Fund will create jobs, reduce emissions, and save money – it’s the kind of innovation that’s needed for local areas to become net-zero. Creating jobs need not cost the Earth.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 13 Dec 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-backbone-of-our-economy/content_286.html": "The Backbone of Our Economy\nSeptember 25, 2021\nSmall businesses are the backbone of our local economy. Plumbers, hairdressers and beauticians, charity workers, arts professionals and creatives. In the North East they represent around half a million jobs. In fact, 95% of businesses in our region are micro-businesses, employing ten people or fewer. And, sadly, small firms often struggle to get the financial backing they need.\nThe pandemic has been tough on them. Excluded UK represents a whopping 3 million limited companies, sole traders and freelancers left out in the cold by Government and the Treasury. Locally, the North of Tyne put £5 million into giving a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable, but we were only able to scratch the surface. Soon, firms will face the combined effects of their VAT deferments falling due, furlough coming to and, Bounce Back Loan payments kicking in, and a host of other temporary support measures all ending within months. Add in recent National Insurance hikes, and many small firms fear for next year.\nSmall businesses often trade with each other. If a customer goes bust, and doesn’t pay their invoices, there’s a risk of a domino effect. I’ve suggested to the CBI and others that Government develop a scheme to prevent this. They’d need to crunch the numbers, but the concept is simple. If you’ve fulfilled a contract, but your customer goes bust for Covid-related reasons, Government should step in and pay a substantial part of the invoice.\nIt’s not dissimilar in concept to insolvency support that workers get. If your employer goes bust, you can apply to the Government for your outstanding pay and unpaid redundancy money. So many people are now self-employed one way or another, they need this protection. I hope this becomes Government policy.\nEven before Covid, though, small businesses faced an uphill playing field against big business. Access to finance is difficult. For a bank loan, you typically have to risk your family home as collateral – if you have one. Even amongst people aged 35-44, only 50% of people are homeowners. Working class people of any age with good business ideas find it hard to raise the cash to start a business.\nToo often when funding is available, it extracts wealth from our local economy. Loans have to be paid back of course, with interest. If it’s from hedge funds, or commercial banks, this sucks out wealth to pay shareholders’ dividends and profits. This rarely feeds back into the local economy. More likely it gets funnelled through tax havens.\nLast week at the North of Tyne cabinet, we agreed a package of access to finance measures to address this. Backed by £15 million over five years from our Investment Fund, it will boost small business growth. It will give people of ordinary means a chance to become their own boss. And it will recycle local capital, keeping wealth in our region.\nIt’s got the heft required to make a real difference. There’s £10 million in the package for equity investment – a challenge the North East faces. Although we account for 2.3% of the UK economy, only 1.4% of the total UK private equity and venture capital is invested here. By having a fund to directly invest in small, local firms, start-ups and scale-ups, we can accelerate the economic recovery. As the fund grows, the money will be recycled, supporting more local firms, and creating more jobs here.\nFor cooperatives, and businesses trading with a social purpose, it’s even harder. Investors expect a vote in your business, and the legal structure of worker-owned or community-owned businesses often prevents that. So we’ve made £4 million available to directly invest in these businesses, as a source of patient capital to help them grow.\nWe’ll underpin these funds with strong ethical values. I was presenting an award at the North East Business awards on Thursday. It’s heartening to see how many local firms really want to look after their employees. How many take real steps to give something back to their communities. And how many take their environmental responsibilities seriously.\nThis is a win-win approach. The investment will pay for itself and do much social good along the way.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 27 Sept 2021",

For that to work you need powers and a budget. Transport effects all of us on a daily basis. It’s a key part of what we need to sort out the region.\nAt North of Tyne we don’t have transport powers devolved like Greater Manchester or West Yorkshire. We don’t yet have the powers to regulate the buses, cap fares, and bring in integrated ticketing. The new North East devolution deal would give us that.\nI’m already a voice for the region on transport as I sit on the Transport for the North Board and represent the whole North East on the Rail North Board. I have a clear vision of how transport can work in the North East for its residents.\nIt means redesigning our transport system so we’re not sitting in cars belching fumes. Fast, efficient, affordable public transport is our future. Including making walking and cycling safer. I’d like to see a world where anyone can ride a bike to a station, park it securely, get on a bus and transfer that ticket to rail or Metro, get off at the other end and earn a good wage in one of the many companies we’re bringing to the region.\nWe also need better connections into and out of our region.

We watched Love Actually the other day.\nIt traces ten separate stories of love. Romantic, platonic, family. Unrequited love, and betrayal. Bill Nighy puts in a great comedy performance as ageing rock star Billy Mack desperate for a comeback, and Emma Thompson’s emotional range is impressive. It’s unashamedly sentimental, but sometimes a bit of escapism is what we need. After all, Hugh Grant’s version of the Prime Minister is eloquent and caring. Contrast that with real life.

We have presents on Xmas day, and a big dinner. But that’s not everyone’s Christmas experience.\nLove Actually shows different kinds of family, and the impact of mental ill health on family relationships. But what’s noticeably missing is poverty.

The poorest character in the film is a catering manager who works in 10 Downing Street.\nFor millions, the reality is different. Successive Prime Ministers have rigged the game so the rich get richer while the rest of us pay more and get less. After inflation, nurses get £2,715 a year less than in 2010. Police constables £5,595 less. Care workers – who’ve always been under paid – £1,661 a year less than 2010. All the technological gains have gone into the pockets of the already rich. That’s the thanks the keyworkers we clapped in lockdown will get for keeping our country running this Christmas.\nInflation is 5.1%. In 2011, the Cameron government changed the way inflation is calculated from the Retail Price Index (RPI) to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The old method – RPI – is currently 7.1%. Old age and public sector pensions increase according to CPI. But costs such as rail fares and student loans increase with the RPI. Families are under huge pressure to spend, for parents to buy the latest toy. Fuel prices are through the roof – and the poorer you are, the bigger proportion of your income is eats.\nShelter report that 104,000 families in privately rented homes received eviction notices in the last month. In the past three months, 55,000 children have been evicted, along with their families. What long term damage is being done by making children homeless? What costs are we storing up for the future?\nFood is iconic to many Christmas traditions, from mince pies to pigs in blankets. Right outside my office at Newcastle Helix is the People’s Kitchen. A charity providing a warm meal, clothing and support for homeless and vulnerable people, it’s open every day of the year. Christmas Day is no exception. Over 200 meals were served, and a safe haven provided.\nHunger in Britain is rampant. It’s worse than when Dickens was writing. In 1846, there were 1.3 million paupers from a population of 26 million. In 2021, 5.9 million adults experienced food insecurity in the six months from February and August! That’s a 50% increase on 1846, even allowing for population size.\nBoris Johnson will be ditched before the next election. But whoever is the next Conservative leader will have voted for austerity. Voted against giving kids free school meals in the holidays. Voted against paying key workers properly. Voted against private rented homes being fit for human habitation.\nPlease, do give to charity if you can. It makes a difference right now. But it’s a sticking plaster. As Clement Attlee said, “Charity is a cold, grey, loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim.”\nUK citizens give £10.1 billion a year in charity. UK tax havens cost £120 billion. What we really need is a different economic approach. We need socialism, actually.",

On May 1 he held a conference telephone call with what’s called the M9 group of mayors, including Mr Driscoll.\nFollowing the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “Clearly, as we get this whole country back on its feet, mayors should be at the forefront of local recovery.”\nBut Mr Driscoll said he had not been consulted about Mr Johnson’s television address on Sunday, when the Prime Minister called on people to return to work.\nThe Labour mayor said: “My understanding is that even some Cabinet ministers didn’t know.\n“We needed guidance – which is only now starting to come out – before he announced these things.\n“I know businesses that are genuinely worried and don’t know whether they should open or not, because they don’t know if it’s safe.”\nThe Government has now published guidance for firms explaining how they should implement social distancing in their workplaces.\nMr Driscoll said: “Business leaders I have been talking to have been openly mocking the approach . You can’t have a situation where you announce there will be major changes and then days later the detailed information comes out.”\nKey workers have been allowed to send their children to school throughout the lockdown, but the Government has said it hopes to open classrooms for every child in some year groups after June 1.\nMr Driscoll said: “As for schools coming back, I’m of the opinion that unless we get a guarantee that it’s safe then we shoudn’t be doing it.”\nThe lockdown had a devastating impact on ticket revenues for the Tyne and Wear Metro.\nThe Government has provided the Metro with £8.6m in emergency funding to keep trains running, but this is only due to last until mid-June.\nAs people return to work, the Metro and the region’s bus services will become even more vital. But social distancing – which means passengers have to sit further apart – means income from fares will be severly cut for the forseeable future.\nThe Government’s plan for ending the lockdown includes identifying outbreaks of Covid-19 at what it calls “community level”, so that local lockdowns can be re-imposed to contain outbreaks.\nA document published by the Government states this could include measures “to close schools or workplaces where infection rates have spiked, to reduce risk of further infection locally”.\nMr Driscoll said he doubted whether local lockdowns could work.\n“I certainly think we need clarity of messaging. If you are going to have different messaging from one town or city to the next then I don’t think that’s helpful.\n“There are people travelling all over the country. There are supply chains. If we open the rail system, what are we going to do? Say you can’t get off at particular stations?”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_honesty-is-more-than-the-absence-of-lies/content_70.html": "Honesty is more than the absence of lies\nJanuary 7, 2024\nHonesty is more than the absence of lies. You know the classic oath, “to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”\nContrary to popular expectations, I’ve found very few politicians who are outright liars. In private, a good number are quite truthful. Sadly, though, as soon as it comes to public statements, many will blame, make excuses, and misrepresent others. Many are uncomfortable being dishonest, but do it anyway.\nI’m not talking about people putting their best foot forward – dressing smartly, or presenting your point well. If I do a live Zoom interview on telly from my home office, I put on suit and tie, even though moments earlier I was in a t-shirt. We all dress smartly when we go to a wedding – it’s not dishonest, it’s respectful.\nLikewise, expressing your argument succinctly is an honest thing to do. You have very little time to make your point, and can’t go into every nuance and caveat. If asked about my record as Mayor, I’ll say, “5,377 jobs, 1,948 homes, child poverty prevention in 98 schools, and negotiated a £6.1 billion devolution deal”. It’s all true, and nothing but the truth. But if you want the whole truth, that will take hundreds more words. Or thousands. We have something like 135 live projects at the moment. I can’t fit them all into an answer. Brevity is the soul of wit.\nWhich is why I’ve hosted Mayor’s Question Times since I was elected. It’s why I’m holding Town Hall meetings across the North East pretty much every week – and giving people detailed answers to whatever questions they want to ask me. Very, very few politicians are willing to subject themselves to that kind of scrutiny. Come along and see for yourself.\nThe most common form of political dishonesty is not the outright whopper. “I drove to Barnard Castle to test my eyesight.” Or “the Covid rules were observed in Number 10 at all times.” These are deliberate statements of something they knew to be factually untrue. The Michelle Mone corruption was clearly about personal enrichment.\nMost political dishonesty is about twisting the truth, rather than denying it.\nDeliberate false promises are lies. Boris Johnson was a serial false promiser. I could write a whole article just listing them. But one stands out for me. He made a speech promising to dual the A1 all the way up to Scotland. It was serially delayed, but he repeated the speech. I arranged a meeting with a transport minister. “The PM said you’re going to fund the A1 all the way to Scotland, where’s that at?” I asked him. His answer? “The PM says a lot of things. The numbers don’t add up.”\nI think Sir Keir’s Ten Pledges were deliberately misleading. To go from ten down to zero before you’re even elected? That tells me he was never committed to them. He’s now quietly removed them from his website. If he is so cynically dishonest and manipulative before getting into power, what can we expect when he’s under pressure as Prime Minister? We saw how quickly Tony Blair became embroiled in scandals and eventually the lies surrounding the Iraq War.\nWhen Mr Sunak cancelled HS2, Labour heavily criticised him for it. Quite rightly – it was mismanaged on his watch, with many unanswered questions. But when asked, “would you commit to building it?” Labour at first avoided the question. Then came out with the excuse that the land would be sold off before they were in power. Which it turns out, isn’t true. Blaming the Conservatives for doing something you intend to do yourself is twisting the truth.\nMr Sunak’s record on truth is no better. Although he doesn’t put much effort into hiding his agenda of making the rich richer. Or not giving a toss about the climate emergency. Or the bizarre obsession with sending refugees to Rwanda in a cynical electoral gambit. His dishonesty is the way he justifies it.\nLiz Truss’s dishonesty was in manipulating normal process to get her doctrinaire tax cuts through. She and Dr. Kwarteng deliberately cut the Office of Budget Responsibility out of the loop. Their disastrous mini-budget cost mortgage holders £thousands.\nMost political dishonesty, though, is a form of Whattaboutery. Whattaboutery relies on blame and anger to work as a distraction. It could be scapegoating. “It’s not me guv, it’s the last lot what done it.” Or “it’s them immigrants.” It solves nothing.\nIt typically stems from intellectual dishonesty. Rather than thinking something through, people reach for an easy, but feeble excuse. Every mistake gets blamed on someone else. Attacking political opponents gets rewarded with tribal loyalty.\nThe real damage the lack of honesty causes is an absence of sound thinking. It’s hard work to construct an argument about why your opponents are taking the wrong path, and propose a better alternative. Much easier to vent. We need our political leaders to say, “Can we try this instead? Here’s my plan, and this is why I think it will work.” And that’s what worries me most. No one is advancing a plan to make Britain a better place for the people who do the work.\nSo what’s the future for honesty in politics? Well, you can help. Reject the spin and the hype. The blame. The feeble justifications. Calmly ask for the facts. Ask for the reasoning behind the facts. And always, always, ask, “What would you do instead? And how would you make that work?”",

If your pay is failing to keep up with inflation, if your burglary isn’t investigated, if your energy bill eats up all your disposable income, that’s politics affecting your life.\nOn Tuesday, it’s a racing certainty that Liz Truss will be appointed (not elected) Prime Minister. She plans to change the law to compel striking workers to turn up to work. When the state compels people to work against their wishes, it’s called conscription. And if it’s done for private profit, even for just one day, it’s called slavery.\nWhether Ms Truss will implement that is a different question. She was a Remainer. Then a zealous Brexiteer. She supported Britons to fight in Ukraine, then she didn’t. She wanted to build on the green belt, now she doesn’t. She said the monarchy should be abolished, now she wants to buy them a new yacht. She announced plans to cut civil servants pay outside of London, and the next day she denied it.\nI can do no better than quote Marx: “Those are my principles, and if you don’t like them… well, I have others.” Groucho. Less flippantly, I’ll quote Hannah Arendt, “If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer.”\nEvery time someone says, “politicians are all the same,” the Donald Trumps and Boris Johnsons of this world smile inside.\nLast year, against civil service advice, Ms Truss took a US trade delegation to a private Mayfair club owned by Tory donor Robin Birley. She and her guests drank two bottles of dry gin, three £153 bottles of a Spanish white wine and two bottles of red at £130 each, part of a total bill of £3,000 that was put on expenses. On the rare occasions I take someone for a drink to politically lobby them, I pay for it myself. My total expenses claims since being elected are £0. I even pay for my own phone and laptop.\nJust weeks after the UK hosted Cop26, Ms Truss chartered a private plane for a trip to Australia. It cost us, the taxpayers, “at least” £500,000, burned 150 tonnes of fuel, causing 500 tonnes of CO2 emissions. She could have got on a scheduled flight.\nI have no official transport. If I go to London, I get the train, standard class. When I went on a visit to a construction project we’d funded the hosts told my PA, “We have a parking space for the Mayor’s limousine.” “That’s very kind,” she replied, “but is there anywhere he can chain up his bike?”\nOn balance I think politicians are the same as everyone else – standards of integrity vary widely. Most politicians I’ve met range from hard working to workaholic.\nI’ll work with the new PM, and her new cabinet, as I have with dozens of ministers and Secretaries of State so far. We’ve landed some good results, too. Funding to reopen the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line. Over £100m in new bus funding. £24m to build new homes on brownfield land. £millions in extra funding for skills training in green industries and digital training. And a massive amount of progress on a new devolution deal – to be announced soon, I hope.\nIf you were a member of the Conservative party, you got to vote on who is the Tory leader. You’d also get a say in who are the MPs who shortlisted them. So if you want Penny Mordaunt to lead the Tories or Andy Burnham to lead Labour, or, erm, one of the other Lib Dems to lead them, join a political party. If you believe in PR, join a party and lobby for it.\nYou can be in a political party and still campaign in other ways. On Thursday I’m speaking at the People’s Assembly at Newcastle Arts Centre on the cost of living crisis.\nPolitics will affect you. It’s a fact. Shouting at the telly will achieve precisely nothing. So you have a choice. Will you affect politics, or get what you’re given?\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 5 Sept 2022",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/content_154.html": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\nJune 1, 2020\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It’s not often that Spaghetti Western titles provide a framework for economic analysis. But this sums up the choices facing the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.\nWe went into this crisis with a quarter of our people getting paid less than they need to live on, a third of our kids in poverty, and our planet facing ecological catastrophe within a generation.\nNow here’s the rub. How do we make sure that the recovery is about wellbeing and sustainable green growth that works for everybody?\nThere’s stark choices to make in deciding how we rebuild.\nLet’s start with the Ugly.\nThe Ugly\nA full-on shock doctrine combining a more authoritarian state with uncontrolled corporate capitalism. The government tried making some carers and NHS staff pay twice to use the NHS, just because it’s popular to blame immigrants.\nCowboy economics assumes infinite resources. When one area is used up, move on to another to exploit. When small companies go the wall, corporate raiders hoover-up their assets at cut prices. Outsourcing on steroids. The approach of Trump’s America.\nCrippling austerity will be used to “pay for” the emergency response to the pandemic. The Ugly subordinates everything to the “free-market” – which is anything but free. Procurement rules are thrown out so contracts go to close contacts. This approach has led to the highest death rate in Europe. Working people are just cannon-fodder for corporate machines.\nEconomic growth is encouraged by “supply side economics”. Or more accurately, letting the mega rich avoid taxes. In just one example, Virgin have taken £2 billion in NHS contracts and not paid a penny in corporation tax. They’ve sued the NHS for £2 million when they didn’t get the deal they wanted, and walked away from the East Coast Mainline rather than pay what they owed. Registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, the Virgin group takes the wealth created by working people to pay for private islands.\nThe Ugly is not pro-business, it’s pro-billionaire. Take this approach, and we’ll see a second spike followed by a generation of talent squandered through rocketing youth unemployment, in work poverty, and rising crime.\nThe Bad\nThere’s a conflict amongst the establishment. The Financial Times is calling for a “more sustainable and inclusive form of capitalism.” Many in Treasury recognise the need for “fiscal stimulus”.\nThe default approach is to kick-start the economy by spending billions on concrete and tarmac. More road widening, roundabout upgrades, and shiny new schools and hospitals. Funded by quantitative easing, government borrowing, and “departmental savings”. We’ve been here before with PFI. Lovely buildings, but “departmental savings” mean we can’t afford to pay the teachers and health professionals we need to work in them.\nIt assumes that any spending in the economy will reach everyone equally. That wealth “trickles down”.\nIt doesn’t, and it never has. Wealth trickles up. That’s what interest is – those with money to spare take interest from those too poor to make ends meet. It widens the wealth gap. And it costs us all a fortune in poor health, poor education, and innovative small firms struggling to get the funds they need to grow.\nWhitehall is already talking about pay freezes for public sector workers and turning a blind eye to the bankruptcy councils are facing.\nThe Good\nThe Good means putting local economies front and centre. Sometimes called Community Wealth Building, it’s a set of place-based policies that work together to make sure that we all earn more and spend more locally.\nIt means shortening supply chains so we build here. It means the public sector spending its money with local firms who pay the Real Living Wage and have sustainable operating models. It means funding training for workers to take new jobs in new industries.\nIt means abandoning the carrot-and-stick approach to unemployment, instead providing tailored help, whether that’s digital skills training or mental health support.\nIt means new ways of supporting innovation, not with tax breaks, but with public ownership and partnership investment in our start-ups. New approaches to house building that supports local firms and ownership, such as community land trusts. It means banks owned by local communities.\nAnd it works. The Spanish Basque country rejected the free market fundamentalism. Its place-based economics has given an otherwise poor region a per capita income way above the EU average and an acclaimed environmental and wellbeing rating. It’s being rolled out in the UK by the Welsh government, and councils including Preston, North Ayrshire, and Newham. And The North of Tyne.\nPost-1945 we faced a choice. Go back to the depression and slums of the 1930s. Or go forward, build the NHS, public housing and welfare state. The Bad and The Ugly won’t level us up. Only The Good will.\n(Published in The Chronicle and The Journal on 1st June 20)",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_a-million-reasons-to-act/content_176.html": "A Million Reasons to Act…\nOctober 25, 2020\nUnprecedented times demand unprecedented measures. That’s the gist of a new report on youth employment published last week by the Alliance for Full Employment. Youth Report: A Million Reasons to Act is based on a study by Professor Paul Gregg from Bath University. He warns that as many as one million young people will be unemployed by the start of November. Without urgent action we’ll see a Covid generation as lost as the 1980S YTS generation.\nThe economic havoc wreaked by the pandemic disproportionately targets the under-25s. We’ve had years of a gig-economy and zero-hours contracts. Too many young people have precarious jobs as bar staff, delivery workers, and other low paid work.\n60% of post-March redundancies are 16 to 24 years old. The unemployment rate for young men is already three times the over-25 rate. In the North of Tyne we’ve seen the youth claim count rise from 3,700 to 7,000. That’s a near doubling between March and August. The real number unemployed is worse – many young people are ineligible for benefits.\nWhen the furlough scheme finishes in a week’s time, a million 16-24 year olds will need a job. There’s a scarcity of new vacancies. Half a million more school and college leavers have joined the job market. Prospects are bleak. As in the 1980s, youth unemployment in the North and Midlands could exceed 20%.\nLong term unemployment can scar a young person’s future. Decades later we see stunted careers, poverty, mental ill health and poor community engagement. Getting young people earning a living in secure jobs is good for all of us.\nSince the onset of the pandemic, my officers have worked tirelessly to create opportunities for our young people. We’ve used our devolved Adult Education Budget to help 37,500 young people enrol for qualifications and training. We’ve funded projects like the Nurture, Nourish and Thrive programme at the Cedarwood Trust in North Shields. Youngsters in the local area can gain qualifications in childcare, and related skills.\nWe’re adapting the national £2 billion Kickstart scheme to have a local place-based approach. One that suits the needs of young people in North of Tyne. Kickstarters are for youngsters under 24 on Universal Credit. Under the scheme, employers get £6,500 per person to cover six-months’ wages. Plus £1,500 per person to pay for wrap-around support – training, coaching and the like.\nHowever, only employers who can take 30 or more young people can apply directly. So the North of Tyne Combined Authority will become a “Gateway” organisation for the scheme.\nWe’re investing an extra £500,000 to help our small businesses join the scheme. We’ll support them to provide high quality placements leading to good jobs in the green economy and digital industries. And we’ll make sure the training is high quality, and the young people are learning valuable skills, not just doing grunt work.\nThe Alliance for Full Employment, which I’ve signed up to along with the other Labour Metro Mayors, is calling for the PM to live up to his pledge to do “whatever it takes”. The Alliance is calling for a UK wide jobs summit to provide a coordinated response. This dovetails with the TUC’s call for a Job Guarantee Scheme for young people, not just the “opportunity guarantee” the PM announced over the summer.\nWork schemes and training are essential short-term measures to halt a long-term catastrophe. But the freedom to look for a job is no freedom at all. There have to be jobs to find. I’ve called on the government to fund our Regional Economic Recovery plan, to create 35,000 jobs in the North of Tyne alone. Unemployed, school-leaver, or graduate, young people need permanent jobs. Careers with prospects, and security. The pride that they’re earning a decent living and paying their way. The sense that their fate is in their hands.\nWe can prevent a repeat of the 1980s. We have a million reasons to act now to stop a whole generation of young people losing out.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 26.10.20",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_why-the-governments-rail-plans-are-failing-the-north-east/content_335.html": "Why the Government’s Rail Plans are Failing the North East\nNovember 21, 2021\nOne year ago, my column focused on the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP). It’s the Government’s national rail investment plan for the next thirty years. In a mockery of tragic irony, the IRP was delayed. And delayed. And delayed. While we’ve seen £billions on HS2, £billions on road junctions, and cuts to air passenger duty. When it was finally published last week, the IRP was the metaphorical bus replacement service.\nThe Prime Minister came out with some lame spin about delivering faster and reducing journey times. But if you read the IRP, page 84 says journey time improvements from Newcastle are “subject to stopping patterns.” In other words, the trains will run faster as long as they don’t stop to let passengers get on. Already this year we’ve had to fight off attempts to cancel the Edinburgh to Liverpool train, which will reduce services to Berwick, Morpeth, Newcastle, Durham and Darlington.\nThe North East invented the railways. In 1829, Stephenson’s Rocket was built at the Forth Street Works in Newcastle. It heralded the biggest public transport expansion the world has ever seen.\nTwenty years later, the Queen Victoria opened the High Level Bridge. A masterpiece of Geordie ingenuity, also designed by Robert Stephenson. By the mid-1850s, there were more than 7,000 miles of track across the country, including two tracks across the Belmont Viaduct, opened in 1856, and two tracks across the Durham Viaduct, opened in 1857.\nIn the 1960s, the Belmont Viaduct and Leamside Line were mothballed as part of the Beeching cuts. It was reopened and served as the alternative route when the East Coast Mainline (ECML) was being electrified. It was mothballed again in 1991.\nSo now, only two tracks connect the North East. Coming from the south, the ECML has four tracks until you reach Northallerton. Then it’s just two – one in each direction. All the trains from Edinburgh to London, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool, heading north or south, must share these two tracks with slow moving freight and local commuter services. Only six trains an hour can safely use the track. We’re using 164 year old infrastructure.\nThe Leamside line still exists. It diverges from the ECML at Ferryhill. It travels through the Durham Coalfield, via Washington, and joins the network near Heworth.\nReopening it would give us four tracks. In effect doubling our capacity. We can run 9 intercity trains per hour plus local services. And faster, because slower trains can run down one line, and faster trains down the other. We can integrate Washington and Sunderland into a new Wearside Metro loop. And connect them to the rail network without going into Newcastle Central.\nHS2 costs £307 million per mile. £106 billion in total. London’s Crossrail is £18 billion. Re-opening and electrifying the Leamside Line will cost £600 million. It’s a tiny fraction of the investment London gets.\nA year ago, the Leamside Line wasn’t in any accepted rail plans. After some diplomacy with other Northern Labour mayors, members of Transport for the North committee backed the Leamside Line as part of Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). That was step one.\nBut Government has failed the North, and NPR won’t be built. The Red Wall Conservative MPs must feel betrayed by their leader, and worried for their jobs, knowing that constituents no longer believe Tory promises to “level up the North”.\nBut I’m not giving up the fight. Since publication on Thursday, I’ve already spoken to the rail minister to find a way to get the Leamside Line funded.\nI’ve been bending the ear of all the transport ministers and Secretary of State about the Leamside Line. Our region’s MPs raised it in the Commons.\nThe IRP left a door open. Page 114 says, “Government considers that the case for re-opening the Leamside route would be best considered as part of any future city region settlement.”\nFor the past two years I’ve been calling for our region to unite and working to make it happen. It’s the only way to get transport devolved. And until we’re masters of our own destiny, we’ll always be forgotten by a Government that doesn’t know its Ashington from its Easington.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 22 Nov 2021",

But as Indie says in Raiders, “It’s not the years honey, it’s the mileage”.\nI’m not surprised they’ve chosen the North East as a location, though. For over a millennium, the North East has been a hotbed of creativity and ingenuity. If you’re not convinced, take a look at the Lindisfarne Gospels when we bring them to the Laing next year. The electric light bulb was invented here. And the train. We powered the industrial revolution. In 1878, the world’s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside, Northumberland. Harrison Ford is a climate activist – I wonder if he’ll visit while he’s here.\nIt’s this ingenuity, and our reputation as friendly, hard-working people that will restore the North East’s economy. That’s why as North of Tyne Mayor I’ve launched not one, but three separate funding streams to nurture talent and ingenuity.\nThe North of Tyne Culture and Creative fund gives freelancers and small firms the money to make their ideas real. £2.6 million is available as grants, loans and equity. That’s backed with skills, advice and making connections to get your project off the ground. If you’ve got a business idea in culture or the creative industries, check it out. And tell your mates. It’s on the North of Tyne website, www.northoftyne-ca.gov.uk/news/creative/\nI’ve been crusading about climate change for years. And the Holy Grail of climate change is achieving net-zero. Where we emit less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere than nature removes. Business is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. And business can be part of the solution. Any size business can innovate and help.\nThe North of Tyne Recovery Innovation Fund is offering businesses £1.5m in grants and one-to-one support to turn ideas into reality. You can get between £5,000 and £10,000. To qualify, your innovation has to help either with climate change, creating jobs, or making our economy more inclusive. Innovation doesn’t need to be complicated. It could be as simple as using different technology, or changing a business process.\nThere’s two briefings coming up on Tuesday 29th and Wednesday 30th June. Register at ntca-innovationrecoverygrant.co.uk, and please spread the word. Small firms are the engines of innovation.\nYou don’t have to own a business to make the world a better place. Identifying local talent means supporting local communities. Practical, inclusive, projects bring communities together.\nThe North of Tyne Crowdfunder has had two rounds of funding already. Things like beekeeping on the Meadowell Estate in North Shields. Planting flowers to brighten up your streets. And community film-making. Although probably not with the budget of Indiana Jones.\nIt’s been so successful, we’re launching a third.\nIt works like this. You have an idea that will benefit your community. We’ll give you help and advice to explain it, with our partners Spacehive. You build support in your local community – we can give you the tools to help. And if people in your community like the idea, we’ll give you funding.\nIt’s part of my manifesto commitment to tackle climate change and food poverty. This round is called Zero-Carbon, Zero-Poverty. This can be anything from setting up a community garden or allotment, a food club or community café, or your original idea. Remember, shy bairns get nowt. If you’ve got an idea for improving life here, apply. Better still, get a group of mates and do it together. We’re launching the third round on Tuesday 6th July. Have a look on our website for more information. www.northoftyne-ca.gov.uk/news/zero-carbon-zero-poverty/\nI talk a lot about devolution. About how our destiny should be in our hands. And how decision making is better when it’s not centralised. Well this is me putting it into action. Directly giving the people of the North of Tyne a chance to nurture their talent, themselves.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 21 June 2021",

I can’t help thinking that some people needed to be hugged more as children. To be fair, one Tory council leader described real-terms benefits cuts as “immoral” and made an eloquent case against it.\nConservative Party Chair, the Rt Hon Jake Berry MP, said, though, “People know that when their bills arrive they can either cut their consumption or they can get a higher salary or higher wages, go out there and get that new job.”\nThe war on woke has become a war on facts. 1.2 million people already have a second job. 12 years of austerity has cut education to the extent where Britain is short of data scientists, software engineers and doctors – but students leave university with over £50,000 of debt. Care workers and classroom assistants and staff in railways stations should not have to leave their jobs to pay their bills. The best way to “get a higher salary or higher wages” is to join a trade union – nice to see Jake Berry backing strikes.\nEveryone deserves a warm home, enjoyable holidays, and financial security. Everyone deserves a pay rise to match inflation. That applies to everyone who works or worked for a living, or is unable to work through caring responsibilities, ill health or disability.\nBut we’re far beyond that. Millions of working people and their families are in absolute poverty.\n“My son’s PE kit has just cost me £200,” Katy told me (not her real name). Food, energy, housing and transport are breaking people’s budgets. At the North of Tyne, we’re working with 90 schools to change uniform policy. Like where PE kit requires the school logo, which stops parents buying it from affordable places like Asda George.\nLast week I convened a meeting with our region’s food poverty campaigners. John McCorry told me the West End Foodbank is sending out 2,000 food parcels a month – that feed 5000 people. That’s just one foodbank. Their food stores have one third of what they need to get through this winter.\nOthers spoke of the burnout amongst volunteers. How voluntary and charity organisations unable do their core mission – like running youth groups – because they are running holiday hunger projects instead. How we need sustainable models that maintain people’s dignity and mental wellbeing. Like food pantry models, where people pay what they can, but still get enough food.\nWe’re working with these charities and volunteers to provide help & support – but we shouldn’t have to. My job is economic regeneration – but how can we build a future of high-skilled, high-paid work when we have kids too hungry to learn?\nOur national safety net has huge holes that need fixing. I’d like to see the next Labour government take serious steps towards Universal Basic Income, but that’s a discussion for another day.\nAgain, dignity must be at the heart of our safety net. When my kids were little, we did a foodbank shop every Xmas. It was also part maths lesson. While Caroline and I did a big foodbank shop, we’d give the boys a tenner each, a pad and pen, and set them away.\nLeon got tins of value veg, tuna, pasta, jam, tinned peaches, and cornflakes and UHT milk. And got his sums right to the penny. “I thought about getting people as much food for the money as I could and enough to stay healthy.”\nHis little brother Nelson turned up with some tins of mango and big selection box of chocolate biscuits. “I thought if people had no money left they should get something that would make them happy.”\nThey were both right.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_thriving-creative-communities-help-revitalise-high-streets/content_121.html": "Thriving creative communities help revitalise high streets\nJanuary 21, 2024\n“I haven’t seen a single show at this year’s fringe because I’m too skint, and that I feel sums up the arts: artists unable to see the art.”\nBerwick artist Chloe Smith wrote that in August last year. It’s something I’m determined to change.\nI met Chloe this week. She was full of enthusiasm for the new culture and creative zone in the town that we’ve put £1.5 million into. ‘Create Berwick’ is all about investing in artists to build a year-round economy that provides jobs and opportunities for local people and attracts visitors from all over the world.\nIt’s about a new vision for Berwick as a thriving cultural and creative centre for the 13,000 people who call it home. It’s a plan that’s already working.\nPoliticians often express concern about the future of high streets and town centres. The pandemic accelerated trends that were already underway – the move towards online shopping being the most obvious. The streaming revolution means we no longer need to go to an HMV or Virgin Megastore to buy CDs, videos, or DVDs. We can buy what we want to watch or listen to from the comfort of our own living rooms.\nUsually the plan seems to be about returning to an imagined idyllic past where people emptied their wallets in town and left with bags full of consumer goods. Often the proposal solution amounts to putting in a few benches and a nicer pavement.\nBut a one-size fits all approach rarely works. Nor does wishful thinking.\nThere’s always been change. Town and city centres used to be manufacturing hubs. In the early 19th century Berwick’s commercial, trading and industrial base grew from small businesses becoming major manufacturers such as malting, milling, brewing, tanning, iron manufacturing, textiles, tiling and rope making.\nThe high street as a concept didn’t come about until the 1870s. But back then it was dominated by thousands of different market stalls and shops. These days most people buy their groceries from a supermarket. Or get them delivered to their home. Trying to change that is like trying to turn back time.\nFar better to look at what a place’s advantages are and work to boost them further. Berwick has a good recent track record with arts and culture. And that includes everything from guided relaxation sessions to watching a film about the speedway at Shielfield Park.\nThe Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival, which we gave £170,000 to this year to make it even bigger and better, has been going since 2005. The Maltings, built on the site where the ingredients for beer and whisky used to be made , has been open since 1990. And has sold a million tickets for theatre, dance, music, comedy, films and other activities since then.\nAsk artists what they need and they’ll usually answer, “space”. Anyone walking round Berwick town centre will see that there are a number of empty shops there. What might no longer work for retail could be repurposed as studios. A number of shop keepers already do both – creative people with an income separate to their main business.\nArtists also need money. To become a world class musician, you don’t simply find a job advert on gumtree for a first violinist, borrow your mate’s Stradivarius and rock up to the interview. It takes talent and incredible levels of commitment. And a lot of practice. So part of our plan involves small grants for individuals, freelancers, artists, practitioners, creatives, cultural organisations, collectives and community groups who are delivering, or want to deliver, new work in the Create Berwick zone.\nThis works for Berwick, but every town and city is different.\nWe’re funding similar initiatives in North Shields and Newcastle city centre. No matter where you are in the North of Tyne if you’re an independent artist, creative professional or small business you’ll have access to resources to help you grow. We want year-round jobs in culture and tourism – organising festivals and staging events that don’t depend on summer weather.\nWith the new £6.1 billion devolution deal I negotiated from Government, I will be able to help towns across the North East get the investment that works for them.\nWe also get control of our transport system. With better rural buses, more trains, and integrated ticketing, more people can come to events. And because I’ll make travel free for under-18s, taking your kids for a day out will be more affordable.\nWith a thriving creative community you get more secondary jobs too – everything from cafes and restaurants to joiners and accountants. Because when artists earn more money, like everyone else they’ll want to spend it.\nNo longer unable to see the art, artists like Chloe will go beyond the fringe.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_football-changing-lives-for-years-to-come/content_345.html": "Football Changing Lives for Years to Come\nApril 3, 2022\nWhen I first walked into the North of Tyne Combined Authority in May 2019, it comprised a handful of staff and a cavernous office on Cobalt Business Park. I had a manifesto full of promises to deliver, and a small team raring to get cracking.\nOne of my first meetings was with the Newcastle United Foundation, the charitable arm of Newcastle United (other football teams are available). We met at the disused and derelict Murray House Recreation and Community Centre, a stone’s throw from St James’ Park.\nMurray House was built in the 1930s to provide leisure and training opportunities for the men and boys laid off from the shipyards. Rebuilt in the 1970s, footballing legends like Shola Ameobi and hundreds of other youngsters trained there. Then it closed in 2017.\nThe Newcastle United Foundation, which included Karren Brady and Sarah Medcalf had big ideas for it. They wanted to rebuild Murray House as NUCASTLE, a modern sports facility, with a suite of classrooms championing excellence in education, employment and physical and mental wellbeing. They showed me the architects’ drawings. They had big plans. Which were going to cost big money. Almost £8 million.\nI asked whether they had any financial backing agreed? Er…no. Would I mind being first? So NTCA stepped in. This was the first major investment I signed off as Mayor. £2.6 million, nearly a third of the total cost. With our anchor funding in place, they persuaded other investors the project was viable.\nBut then, having signed it off, you wait. I signed off, with my cabinet, a host of other projects. Offshore wind investment, our culture & creative programme. A slew of job creation programmes.\nFast forward, through the Prorogation of Parliament, the December 2019 General Election, and we’re into the Pandemic. I’d landed our fist big investment creating nearly 1000 jobs, but even they hadn’t recruited the people yet.\nThe teams at the Combined Authority are working their socks off, but Covid means doing everything from home while we all get used to Zoom.\nEverything is still new. Everything is still a ‘work in progress’. And we’re in that no-man’s-land that all new organisations have, where nothing has quite come to fruition yet.\nFast forward again to May 2021, and I get an invitation to ‘sign the steel’ at the NUCASTLE site.\nIt started to feel real. Something tangible at last for all of the time, effort, and investment expended by my team.\nNUCASTLE ‘s work goes way beyond football, sacred though that is in the Toon. And it began way before the site was completed.\nAt the steel signing, I met a young woman called Katie, and listened to her story. Hers wasn’t an unusual one. To begin with. She’d left school and was unemployed. Her confidence was rock bottom. No job. No self-belief. Then she met NUCASTLE, and did a course funded by them.\nBy the time I met her, she had a job. She had confidence. She believed she had a future. She was thinking of going to university. All made possible by NUCASTLE, with a little help from their friends at the North of Tyne Combined Authority.\nFast forward again, to last week, and the opening of the state-of-the art hub on Diana Street, a stone’s throw from St James’s Park.\nNot only does the hub have rooftop pitches, it also has robot footballs that can be programmed by the people who are using them. Kids might be lured in by the footie, but they’ll stay to learn other skills. Programming the robot footballs increases interest in coding and other tech skills.\nIt’s about outreach work and helping people get their careers on track. It covers the communities across our region – and it doesn’t matter whether you support Berwick Rangers or Blyth Spartans.\nSo, if you’re looking to your future, you don’t have to do it alone. There are people who want to help you. The Foundation helped over 26,000 people last year. You can contact NUCASTLE and see what they’ve got to offer at www.nufoundation.org.uk\nIn partnership with organisations like NUCASTLE, the Combined Authority is proud to help expand people’s horizons.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 4 April 22",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_we-need-a-voice-in-westminster/content_177.html": "We’ll still need a strong, independent voice in Westminster\nSeptember 17, 2023\n“Carve nature at its joints,” said Plato. Governance structures should match the functions they serve. I think that means the Prime Minister shouldn’t be responsible for emptying the bins.\nTake the Levelling Up Fund. If councils were allocated funding, they could plan long-term and dovetail projects with existing facilities and services. Instead councils bid into a pot, and ministers decide which projects live and which die, in a glorified tombola.\nWhy are Westminster politicians deciding on train lines between Cardiff Bay and Cardiff Central Station? Or a new ferry for Shetland? Surely the Welsh and Scottish Governments should be entrusted with those projects.\nIt’s wrong to say nothing ever changes, though. The Conservatives created Metro Mayors. Labour is promising a ‘take back control’ bill. Although it’s not clear what that will include. Or whether they’ll stick to it. Even so, we’re far more centralised than our counterparts in Germany or France. Or the United States (the clue is in the name).\nLet’s try a thought experiment. Assume the regions and nations of the UK were independent – to what extent would we want to integrate with each other?\nForeign policy should be the responsibility of central Government. Income and corporation tax should be national, to prevent a race to the bottom. I’d want us to have a single currency. And consistent regulations on road safety, electrical infrastructure, medicines, and so on.\nEconomic development, though, works best at the functional economic area. In most places that’s the conurbation and its rural hinterland. Buses, metros, trams and local rail work best at the city region level, simply because 80% of all journeys occur on that geography.\nWe’re opening a new railway in the North East – the Northumberland Line. Next year, passenger trains will run between Ashington and Newcastle for the first time since the 1960s. Six new stations. Journey times and carbon emissions halved. A huge benefit to the region. But Northumberland council spend years lobbying government, funding business cases, helped by me and some of our MPs. Westminster did finally stump up most of the £162 million cost. The North of Tyne is investing £10 million, and Northumberland council many £millions. But if we just got our fare share of national infrastructure investment, it could have been built years ago, along with Metro extensions and road junction improvements.\nStill, in any new imagined era of devo max we’ll still want a voice in Westminster. Our laws will still be made there. So the launch of the new All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for the North East last week is prescient.\nCredit to Jarrow MP Kate Osborne, its first chair, and Lord Alan Beith, co-chair. I was there, in the Palace of Westminster, along with several dozen of our region’s Labour, LidDem, Conservative and Independent councillors. Two of our region’s MPs spoke, Ian Mearns and Emma Lewell-Buck.\nI’ve always worked cross-party to get things done and all-party groups take the same approach. We’ve secured the best funded devolution deal in England, and I want to build on it. I want to build new Metro lines, and get a fully integrated public transport system. That means working cross party for long-term good.\nThe APPG on democracy and the constitution recently found that the new voter ID system was a ‘poisoned cure’ that disenfranchises more electors than it protects. The fact that it was co-authored by Sir Robert Buckland, who was the Justice Secretary when the changes were proposed, gives its report extra credibility.\nBy chance, I was on LBC’s Cross Questions with him last week. He broadly defended the Conservatives’ record in office, as expected. But agreed with me that the privatisation of the probation service was a mistake. That too often foreign ownership of British assets is bad for our economy. That more devolution is a good thing, and commended my record on getting things done.\nThe final joke question was “Who would you take to contact aliens on another planet?” I said Oliver Postgate, creator of the Clangers, so he could translate for me. At which point Sir Robert began whistling like the knitted, pink, extra-terrestrials.\nHopefully, increased cross-party working will see more Secretaries of State impersonating clangers rather than dropping them.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_great-north-eastern-railways-we-hope/content_209.html": "Great North Eastern Railways, We Hope\nNovember 15, 2020\nThe North East’s rail network has an unusual geography. We’re almost an island – the only routes in or out are the East Coast Mainline, or the track to Carlisle. With all the talk of high speed rail, the biggest problem we face is capacity. There’s no advantage to a train capable of 255mph if it’s stuck behind a Pacer doing 55mph.\nComing from the south, the East Coast Mainline (ECML) has four tracks until you reach Northallerton. Then it’s two tracks all the way to Durham, Newcastle, Berwick and Scotland. That’s one track in each direction.\nIf you’ve ever been on an intercity train through our region, and wondered why it’s driving so slowly, that’s your reason. If one train runs late, it delays all the other services on the same line. This is why you sometimes get stuck crawling along behind a freight train, or stopped for ages at York waiting for a train to overtake.\nThe Transpennine Express trains that run to Manchester can’t travel as fast as the Azumas that go to London. Freight trains run even slower, and are limited to outside peak hours. Anyone who’s caught the last train back from London knows it takes 4hrs 20 minutes. If you’re lucky.\nThe whole line is straining at its capacity. We can squeeze in six trains per hour. Two go to London, two to Manchester / Liverpool, and two to Birmingham and beyond. Because the bottleneck is from Northallerton northwards, HS2 won’t fix this. Even for £106 billion. Nor will HS2a, or HS2b. Or the approximately £40 billion earmarked for Northern Powerhouse Rail. That will mostly be spent digging tunnels under the Pennines, and revamping stations between Hull and Liverpool. Manchester are wanting to spend several £billion on a new underground station. I keep having to remind people, the North doesn’t stop at the M62.\nWhat was in the plan for us? Diddley squat. HS2 would reach York, eventually, possibly in the 2040s. But the shiny new trains would have to use the existing twin track and Victorian infrastructure. Whether Geordie, Mackam, Smoggy or Berwicker, we were supposed to crawl south to York before benefiting from faster trains.\nNone too chuffed with this, our North East transport team have developed an alternative plan. It’s called the Leamside Line. It diverges from the East Coast Mainline at Ferryhill. It travels through the Durham Coalfield, via Washington and joins back up with the network near Heworth. It was mothballed in 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts but the track bed still exists. Reopening it would give us 4 tracks and the extra capacity and reliability we need. It opens the possibility of improving services to Washington and Sunderland. We can integrate it into an expanded Metro network at multiple locations, so you don’t have to go into Newcastle Central to catch a Metro to Sunderland or South Shields. What’s not to like?\nIn effect, it doubles our capacity. We can run 12 trains per hour – and faster, because we can run slower trains down one line, and faster trains down the other. The Leamside route is still there. It’s a tiny fraction of the price per mile of HS2 or London’s Crossrail. Heaven knows why it was missed off the plans.\nI’ve spoken to everyone from the Secretary of State for Transport, three different junior transport ministers, numerous DFT officials, and the chair of the National Infrastructure Commission. I’ve done a double act with Martin Gannon, leader of Gateshead Council and chair of the North East Joint Transport Committee. We’ve even organised some calls mob handed, bringing in local business leaders and the region’s universities.\nIn the next few months, central government will announce its Integrated Rail Plan. Long story short, the Leamside Line is now back in the mix. I never relax until the funding is signed off, but we might finally see some National Rail investment into the North East.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 16.11.2020",

I’d lined up meetings with politicians, influencers and media – shaking people’s hands and looking them in the eye is all part of the process of getting a better deal for the North East.\nI gave a speech to a think tank, nudging government policy on levelling up, and breaking the Oliver Twist approach, “please sir, I want some more.” Until we get more control over our own transport, education, house building and investment, we’ll always be low down Westminster’s list of priorities.\nThen on Tuesday night the chancellor and previous chancellor resigned. I’m sure the PM was thinking of calling an Autumn General Election to head of a challenge. No doubt Messrs Sunak and Javid saw it too, and started the resignation avalanche. People have been trying to get rid of Johnson all year. I was in London 24 hours and he resigned. Just saying…\nI’ve said all year there’s an inevitability to Johnson’s resignation, because he was actually guilty. Of lying. Of covering up his lies. Of criminal behaviour. Of brushing serious sexual offences under the carpet. And lying about it. Greased piglet or otherwise, his career was circling the drain from January. It was a Ponzi scheme: every time he was in trouble, he’d promise something bigger and bolder, and tell bigger whoppers. But he could never honour his promises: honour is not part of his character.\nMany talk of honour, few live it. MP after Tory MP resigned using the same template: “The PM has got the big calls right, but integrity and honour mean I must resign.” Translation: “I knew he was a liar from the off, but while I thought he’d win us an election, I kept schtum.” Honourable members?\nHe did not “get the big calls right”. His version of Brexit was not “oven ready” – the Northern Ireland protocol is unravelling. Britain had one of the highest Covid death rates in Europe. Chaotic hokey-cokey lockdowns. Test and trace wasted £37 billion. £37 billion!! Officially described as “an eye watering waste of money”. Vaccine roll out? In Europe alone, the UK is behind Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Iceland, Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Greece for the percentage of population fully vaccinated.\nThe next PM will be chosen not by the British people, but by Conservative party members. The Tory MPs choosing which two hopefuls make final ballot are the most sophisticated and duplicitous electorate there is. There will be promises made, threats, deals, and double-crosses. It makes for great drama. But terrible government.\nBritain is in chaos. You can’t get a passport. NHS waiting times are out of control. Kids with good A-levels can’t get on university courses. Families can’t afford a holiday. The hard mathematical truth is people’s bank accounts are running out of money before the end of the month.\nWe’ll see a summer of posturing from Tory hopefuls. Feeding time at the zoo – red meat thrown to the party faithful. Culture wars, blaming immigrants. But not a peep about non-dom tax exiles. Illogical calls to lower taxes so people have more money in their pockets. The best way to put more money in people’s pockets is to give them a pay rise.\nAnd the convoluted back-stories. We’ll see re-runs of the Four Yorkshiremen sketch – “When I were a lad…” and how they became millionaires by honest work and paying their taxes. Three of the contenders have been Chancellor of the Exchequer and have used tax avoidance to reduce their tax bills. All in it together?\nLabour must look like a government in waiting. And convince the British people we have a plan to get them out of this mess.\nMy task is to get us the best deal for the North East. As the resignations flooded in, I was making contact with new ministers, and ex-ministers. I’ve been Mayor for three years, and I’m on my fifth local government minister. Three resigned, one sacked, one new one. It happens. We’re at an advanced stage of negotiations. New ministers will want to show government is functioning.

I currently control:\n- £20 million a year investment fund to create jobs and improve the region\n- £25 million a year adult education budget to train people over 18\n- £24 million brownfield housing fund\nI’ve used this to:\n- Create a pipeline of 5,377 jobs and counting, against a government target of 1,667\n- Increase course enrolments from 22,000 to 35,000 a year\n- Built 2,133 new, low carbon, homes on brownfield sites\n- Run a child poverty prevention programme in 100 schools\nI have the power to raise a precept on the council tax, but have not done so. Our people can’t afford it. Instead I’ve levered in:\n- £297 million in private investment to create jobs\n- £9 million this year from government to run free skills training courses\nAs North of Tyne Mayor I do not control the transport system. That is mainly in the hands of central government and private providers. The Tyne & Wear Metro is under local public control, but is heavily dependent on government for funding, with little future certainty.\nThat’s why in February 2020 I went down to the Treasury and argued our case to get transport devolved. I succeeded, and in March 2020 Government announced that the North East could have transport – and billions of funding – if we came together as one, united Mayoral Combined Authority.\nInitially Government wanted to raise our annual investment fund to £35 million. The Tories have massively cut our public services, and austerity has not let up. This was our chance to get some money back for the North East. So I said £35 million wasn’t enough. After dozens of meetings with different ministers, and poring over details with Treasury officials, they agreed to give us the highest devolution settlement in the country, despite having a lower population.\nRegion Population Annual Fund\nNorth East 2.0 million £48 million\nEast Midlands 2.2 million £38 million\nWest Yorkshire 2.3 million £38 million\nGreater Manchester 2.8 million £30 million\nWest Midlands 2.9 million £36.5 million\nIn May 2024 the North of Tyne will be incorporated into the new, expanded North East Combined Authority. In addition to the £48 million investment fund, the adult education budget and brownfield housing funds will be increased. But crucially we get:\n- £410 million new money for transport capital investment from 2024 to 2027\n- £164 million for bus improvement over three years from 2023 to 2026\n- New transport funding will be renegotiated on an ongoing 5 year cycle\nInitially government insisted that we take our existing Metro funding out of our new settlement. Over summer 2022 I argued the case with Transport and Treasury ministers, and eventually they agreed to give us the Metro funding separately. Shy bairns get nowt!\nNone of the new money or powers comes from our existing councils. It all comes from central government. If we had not negotiated this deal, we would still not have got an extra penny for our cash-strapped local authorities. It was not an either-or. It is all new money.\nThe two police and crime commissioners, for Durham Constabulary and Northumbria Police, will continue to exist and will be unaffected by the new devolution deal. We will still have two elected Police and Crime Commissioners. Likewise our fire and rescue services are not part of this deal.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_world-mental-health-day/content_126.html": "World Mental Health Day\nDecember 8, 2019\n“Health, wealth and happiness!” is the toast we’ve all heard. Mental health defines two of these, and impacts on the third. In May, Tyne and Wear Citizens held a Mayoral hustings at the Tyne Theatre, 1000 people attended. The host asked everyone to stand up; a thousand people got to their feet. She then said, “Sit down if you don’t know anyone who has suffered with a mental health issue.” There were still close to a thousand people on their feet.\nToday is World Mental Health Day. The focus this year is suicide prevention. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15 – 29 year-olds worldwide. Men are three times more likely to take their own lives than women. Statistics can’t do justice to the human stories that comprise these numbers. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, friends, colleagues and loved ones.\nOn Monday I visited the Recovery College Collective, on Market Street in Newcastle. ReCoCo, as it’s known, is a peer-led mental health charity. Kate (I’ve changed her name) told me about her mental health journey; her self-harming, her suicide attempts. “I’m only alive because of ReCoCo.” She couldn’t bring herself to fill in forms, she felt judged everywhere she went. She spoke – eloquently – about attending a peer-led group, facilitated by those who had suffered from poor mental health and had recovered. She speaks of “a light-bulb moment” when she recognised her situation was similar, and perhaps she too could recover. She last self-harmed three years ago, she sees the future as she never has before, and is now facilitating peer-led recovery herself. All by meeting other people, in a structured, safe environment, supported by professionals.\nReCoCo is a nomad charity. Like many others, they find temporary homes in unused office blocks, waiting for redevelopment. The City Council waives their business rates, if the landlord lowers the rents. But this is no way to run our public services. Groups like Psychologists Against Austerity have proven the damage caused by cuts. Waiting lists are long, services are patchy, and people with years-long, complex problems compounded by alcohol dependency and drug use might be prescribed a mere six sessions of therapy.\nNine out of ten NHS mental health trusts reported a marked increase in mental health problems when Universal Credit was imposed on the most vulnerable in our society. I asked the people using ReCoCo whether their mental health problems were in part caused by the stresses of poverty. The answer was an overwhelming, and at times cathartic, yes. Insecure work, problems with insecure housing and sofa-surfing. The cost of bus tickets, and people having to choose between heating and eating. A 2017 report from the TUC found the unemployment rate of people with mental health conditions was a shocking 75%!\nMy team is in the final wave of consultations with businesses on our Good Work Pledge. 23% of people in the North of Tyne earn less that the Real Living Wage of £9 an hour, which is the minimum people need to live on to avoid building up debts. Employers will be encouraged to sign up to providing the Real Living Wage, and other pledges that make work rewarding and motivational, such as in-work training, gender equality, and access to trade union support. It’s a fact that unionised workplaces are more productive, have better staff relations, lower sickness rates and lower staff turnover.\nThe good news is I’ve had nothing but support from the major employers and business organisations like the CBI, Chamber of Commerce and Federation of Small Businesses. They know the best way to prosperity is to look after your staff.\nBabies aren’t born feeling suicidal. Somewhere along the way, psychological pressures occur which make kids, adolescents and adults mentally unwell.\nAt that hustings in May, Tyne & Wear Citizens asked me to commit to providing mental health support in every school by the end of my five year term. At any given moment, 1 in 8 schoolkids has a mental health disorder. How Britain has found itself with a mental health crisis amongst children beggars belief. North of Tyne’s devolution means we’re uniquely able to develop an Education Challenge, including mental health professionals in every school. We’ll be pitching government to fund mental health support for kids – and staff – and crucially, we’re working to remove the stresses that cause ill health. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I’m delighted Labour has announced it will reform Ofsted once in government. The “exam factory” culture is neither the best way to improve educational outcomes nor to improve school standards. If we’re to start treating people as human beings rather than economic units, it has to start in childhood.\nThis article first appeared in The Journal and Newcastle Evening Chronicle on 10th October 2019",

Why not the reverse?\nAugust 20, 2023\nYou know the song, “One year of hurt, never stopped me dreaming.” Euro victory last year, World cup final this year.\nThe Lionesses have done us proud. Skill, commitment, courage. Lauren Hemp hitting the bar in the 16th minute. Mary Earps saving a penalty. Alex Greenwood’s bravery. Fighting until the final whistle. Great role models for young women. But I’d also hope, great role models for young men. For years girls have admired and wanted to emulate male footballers. Why not the reverse?\nLet’s be honest here, it’s the success that matters, at least for media coverage and sponsorship. We’ve long taken our women Olympians seriously.\nA phrase struck me when reading a pre-match article: “the lioness Spain will fear most…” Lionesses are fearsome. Strong. Female but not ‘feminine’ with its negative sterotypical connotations. Taken seriously as athletes. Even if they don’t have equal pay.\nA BBC study reported that a Women’s Super League (WSL) Player get’s £47,000 a year on average. For men’s Premier League players it’s £60,000 a week – 66 times more. An economist would point out that’s market forces – the TV money in the men’s game is astronomical. And many would argue the wages are out of control.\nSarina Wiegman gets £400,000 a year to manage England. And she’s coached them to international victory. Gareth Southgate gets £5,000,000.\nTo be honest, I’m not sure anyone needs £5m a year. I reckon you can get by just fine on £400k. But if there’s a case for a wage cap, it’s not on elite athletes and coaches, who are, at least, exceptionally good at their job. And get tested in full public view. I’d start with the utility companies racking up £billions in debt and pumping sewage into our rivers, while their CEOs get £millions.\nBroadcasters are offering up to 100 times less to cover the Women’s World Cup than last year’s men’s tournament in Qatar.\nTwo years ago the Football Association signed a ‘landmark’ multimillion-pound deal with Sky and the BBC for the broadcast rights to the Women’s Super League. The agreement is reported to be worth £8m a season – the biggest broadcast deal of any professional women’s football league in the world. It expires in 2025.\nCompare that to the Premier League’s £5 billion TV deal in the UK, with roughly the same again from overseas broadcasters. Of course, the Premier League split away from the FA to earn more money and spread less to the grassroots.\nIf you want to raise your game, you need to play at a level that stretches you. That’s true of pretty much anything, not just football, or sport in general. My niece played football, trained hard, and loved it. She played in a mixed team, until she had to stop at the age of twelve. Then there were so few girls’ teams, she had few opportunities to play. This is twenty years ago, when the FA rules stopped mixed teams after a certain age.\nIt’s changed now, and young players can be in mixed teams up to 18. There are also more competitive girls’ leagues around. As a country we’re improving rapidly. Inspired by the Lionesses, we’re improving even faster.\nI spoke to Steve Dale, chairman at Wallsend Boys Club – famous for producing 92 professional players, including Alan Shearer to Michael Carrick. “These days the Premier League academies snap up anyone who looks like they’ve got some talent,” he told me. They focus on the fitness, the team spirit. The courage and discipline. And above all, the enjoyment. I saw boys and girls training together.\nI’ve taught and trained with dozens – probably hundreds of women in Jiu Jitsu over the years. We never had separate sessions or rules or gradings for women. Everyone did the same thing, and it was very physical and full on. Many’s the time I’ve seen a strapping bloke look up in shock and awe after a woman black belt has hurled him over her shoulder and flattened him on the floor. We never had any issue with women being taken seriously.\nAnd if there’s an tongue-in-cheek argument goes on in a home somewhere tomorrow where a woman tells her husband, “We brought home the trophy, it’s your turn to bring home the shopping and collect the kids,” then maybe it’s worth waiting 57 years.",

We work with people. This is the approach which informs all of our programmes and the way we interact with our partners.\nCommunity Wealth Building is an important part of this. Essentially, it is a policy of keeping local the wealth generated in our region and, in keeping it local, making sure that all of our residents and communities benefit from it. Co-design and collaboration is an important element in making sure that our economy is truly inclusive. It is an approach which is informed by our overarching goal of improving the wellbeing (financial, physical and mental) of all our residents.\nWe closely collaborate with our partners in the Voluntary, Community and Social Economy (VCSE) sector through the quarterly NTCA/VCSE stakeholder engagement group. We communicate regularly with the VCSE community through the £346k VCSE Small Grants Programme (such as the Angelou Centre in Newcastle, working with marginalised young people). We also continue to work closely with the local business community and the trade unions. We are currently developing further mechanisms of collaboration and co-design with residents’ groups.\nI have quarterly meetings with the business organisation representatives; CBI, North East Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, TechUK and MakeUK. We work closely with these organisations as they have superb knowledge of what their members are thinking and feeling. I also regularly visit local businesses so I know what ishappening on the ground.\nWe have our quarterly Inclusive Economy board, chaired by Tanni Grey Thompson, which has people attending from across the sector.\nOur Poverty Truth Commission has at its core fifteen commissioners, people with lived experience of poverty. They will be focussing on food poverty, caring responsibilities and health with the aim of coming up with practical interventions which will make a difference to the lives of people struggling on a low income.\nOur Equalities Assembly has taken place attended by a diverse range of people with protected characteristics. The focus is on the barriers to good work with the aim of formulating possible interventions to address these.\nI hold a quarterly Mayor’s Question Time, located a different places throughout the North of Tyne region. Anyone is welcome to submit a question and come along. That’s how democracy works. I believe in making myself available to answer questions.\nAs an organisation we also lead by example with our forward thinking value and ethics-base policies (Equality and Diversity, Social Value) which are embedded in our organisation’s culture.\nI could list another hundred ways we’ve co-designed and listened. From our crowdfunding which engages communities at a grass roots level to the events run to design of our new Social Economy fund. It’s at the heart of everything we do.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_are-our-energy-plans-more-baldric-than-beveridge/content_171.html": "Are our energy plans more Baldrick than Beveridge?\nSeptember 3, 2023\nMax out our fossil fuel reserves, says Mr Sunak. Make Britain a clean energy superpower, says Sir Keir. Two rival ideas for energy security and electricity generation. But does either plan stack up?\nI met with Sir John Armitt last week. He chairs the National Infrastructure Commission. They recommend an independent, evidence-led, long-term plan to the government. Which the government then duly ignores.\nHe’s clear that the UK’s infrastructure is simply not good enough – whether power, water, roads or railways. Never mind becoming a superpower – being in touching distance of our European counterparts would be a start. Dutch roads , Swiss railways , Cypriot water quality.\nLet’s examine Mr Sunak’s claim that new gas and oil exploration will protect jobs and secure lower bills.\nFirstly, these companies sell their fossil fuels to the highest bidder on the global market. Only 4% of Britain’s gas comes from Russia, but we still got slammed by price hikes. Private companies act in the interests of their shareholders, not the public.\nSecondly, on average it takes 28 years to bring a new field on line. That takes us to 2051, the year after the government’s own legal net-zero target. Today’s gas or oil worker will have long since passed on before these fields exhaust their reserves.\nAnd Mr Sunak’s advisors know this. So he’s being dishonest. You might even conclude he’s putting the interests of wealthy shareholders ahead of the working people of Britain. Their “ten point plan for a green industrial revolution” was unveiled less than three years ago. It’s already in tatters, and, frankly, abandoned.\nSo what of Sir Keir’s plan for a clean energy superpower?\n“By 2030, the UK will be the first major country in the world to run on 100% clean and cheap power” says Labour’s plan. A noble ambition I wholeheartedly support.\nBut without up-front investment for long-term gain, it will never happen. It’s full of phrases like, “we will look at…” “we have an ambition to…”. There is no guarantee of any new money. Instead it contains their favourite new buzzword, “securonomics.” George Orwell warned us about politicians making up words in 1984.\nThere’s some sensible stuff in there – changing planning rules to allow onshore wind. If any government makes that planning change, I’ll help local communities secure investment from pension funds and green community bonds. It could give town and parish councils a regular income stream.\nBut electricity is currently only 20% of UK energy use. 80% is oil powered vehicles and gas powered boilers. Switching to electric cars and heat pumps requires quadrupling grid capacity.\nOur current grid is inadequate. Two years ago Storm Arwen knocked out the power supply to 1 million homes, many in the North East. Some without electricity for over a week. Why was one storm so devastating? Many homes were connected by a single wire – a single point of failure. If you’re an engineer like me you’ll know that that is a recipe for disaster.\nA quick look at Northern Powergrid (Northeast)’s accounts shows an operating profit of £125 million on a turnover of £355 million. That’s 35% of revenue taken as operating profit.\nNorthern Powergrid (Northeast) is owned by Northern Powergrid Holdings, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, previously known as MidAmercian Energy Holdings Company, which is 90% owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which is run by Warren Buffet, who has a personal net worth of $121 billion. Up from $102 billion 2 years ago. Has your wealth increased by 19% over the past two years?\nNor is he the only example. The French state owns EDF. Scottish Power’s largest shareholder is the Qatar Investment Authority. Northumbrian Water is 75% owned by a Hong Kong based billionaire, via CK Hutchison Holdings, and 25% owned by New York private equity firm KKR.\nIt wouldn’t cost a fortune to fix. Simply regulate these companies to deliver the high standards Britain needs. Their cash-cow days would be over, their share prices would fall, and we could bring them into public ownership. And not under central government control. But as publicly owned trusts run with a remit of long-term sustainability.\nUntil Westminster parties grow a backbone and stop £billions being siphoned abroad from our infrastructure, their plans will always be more Baldric than Beveridge.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_manifesto_full-employment_a-bright-start-tackle-child-poverty-and-school-exclusions/content_101.html": "A bright start – tackle child poverty and school exclusions\nSchool should be the foundation of a successful career. But our child poverty rate is horrendous. The medium-term solution is getting more money in parents’ pockets through higher wages. But this is urgent. Which is why I’ve been funding our Child Poverty Prevention programme in 90 schools – hailed as a model of best practice. It directly tackles school uniform poverty, kids being priced out of after school activity, and gives discreet welfare rights advice to families, in one case netting them £11,000 in backdated benefits for their disabled son they didn’t realise they were entitled to. I’ll also work with our local councils to make sure every child who is entitled to free school meals gets them.\nThe North East has twice the national rate of kids permanently excluded from school. Often by academy chains to make their stats look better. I know of kids being taxied across Northumberland for three days a week, and no one knows where they are on Thursday and Friday. This is stunting their education and curtailing their futures before they’ve even left school. We need to provide proper alternative provision, so kids stop falling through the gaps.\nDevolution of the careers service will enable us to link skills courses, employment opportunities, local businesses and the public sector to give young people a pathway into work that works for everyone. I want to extend this to lifelong support – let’s face it, technology is moving faster than ever, and many people need advice and support as adults.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_better-public-transport-for-everyone-is-the-destination/content_66.html": "Better public transport for everyone is the destination\nFebruary 18, 2024\n“If people get a railroad, it is all they want; they do not care how or by whom it is done.”\nRobert Stephenson said that nearly 200 years ago. The man who invented the Rocket. A railway pioneer. And he was right about the transformative power of the railways.\nIn 2019, just after I was elected Mayor, I spoke to a teacher at Ashington Academy. She said it was always the same story. Every September she’d see 20 to 30 of her former students waiting at the bus stop to go to college in Newcastle. And by January it would be down to 4 or 5. The cold and wet, the cost, and the unreliable service meant that few persevered.\nThat’s the difference that transport makes. A bad service closes down life chances. A good one opens up new opportunities.\nThe next generation won’t have this problem. They’ll be able to get the train to Newcastle in 35 minutes. A journey time cut in half. And they’ll travel on the new Northumberland Line.\nThis new railway is real. You can see the stations being built. Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval, and Northumberland Park.\nIt’ll open this summer, with services from Ashington to Newcastle, via Newsham and Seaton Deleval. The other stations will be opened once they’re completed.\nYou can also see some formidable engineering challenges, like I did at Northumberland Park. There’s almost no space to build the new platform opposite the existing Metro station, except on some very steep land. As construction proceeded, engineers found large voids under the adjacent flats. That’s not uncommon in our part of the world, given that we’ve been digging coal out of the ground for two thousand years. They’ve had to pump in thousands of tonnes of grouting to protect against future subsidence.\nThe Northumberland Line is the only new passenger line being built in England and Wales. Like any major engineering project it’s been a team effort. Northumberland County Council and the Department of Transport working on it for years.\nPeople have talked about opening it since the 1990s. Back in 2007 Wansbeck MP Denis Murphy and Blyth MP Ronnie Campbell started a debate in Parliament. Denis’s successor, Ian Lavery, kept up the pressure. Supported all the while by local campaigners, including SENRUG – South East Northumberland Rail Users’ Group. I’ve met with them many times. Their technical knowledge is impressive. I only got involved after I was elected as North of Tyne Mayor in 2019.\nIt’s not been plain sailing, if you’ll forgive the mixed metaphor.\nAt one point the Government wanted to cut the number of stations. I spoke to the then rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris and persuaded him not to. At another point they wanted to cut the service from half hourly to hourly. I said that would make the project unviable. They eventually agreed with me.\nEnabling people to get where they need to go is crucial. You could have a world class college or thriving business park but if people can’t get to it everyone misses out.\nA railway line brings benefits in both directions. Yes – it will make it easier for people living in Ashington to get to Newcastle to study and work. But it will also open up Ashington for visitors to explore and play as people move in the opposite direction. We’ve invested in Ashington businesses to help them to be ready for these new opportunities.\nAnd it isn’t just about Ashington. The North of Tyne has invested £10 million into the project. From building a bridge in Blyth, renovating Newcastle Central Station, and making it easier for everyone to get from their homes to the stations on the route.\nThis is the first step towards building a Total Transport Network. I negotiated our £6.1 billion devolution deal with Central Government. And I’ll use it to build London-style fully integrated public transport. Under public control. With cross-ticketing on Metro, bus, rail and ferry. Low fares for everyone, and free travel for young people 18 and under. Every city, town and village connected by buses, the Metro and rail system. New rail or bus routes to the Outer West of Newcastle, and to Team Valley in Gateshead. Extending the Metro into Washington. Relaying track on the old wagon way to get trains running from Northumberland Park to Percy Main. Reopening the Leamside Line in County Durham.\nWhile much of the country remains stuck in traffic, in the North East we’re the heirs of Stephenson. The Northumberland Line is just the beginning. Better public transport for everyone is the destination.",

Decommissioned twenty years ago, it’s stood empty since. Now, thanks to the work of local women’s veterans’ organisation, Salute Her, a new life as a wellbeing centre for women veterans could be on the horizon.\nPaula from Salute Her gave me a tour of the building. We met with staff from English Heritage, the custodians of the site, and Sir Alan Campbell, MP for Tynemouth.\nPaula’s vision is for a Health & Wellbeing Centre for women veterans. Its history both as a place of sanctuary makes it an ideal location. It’s a safe, women-only space, where veterans will get help with mental health issues and trauma resulting from military service. It will be a first not just for the region, but nationally. It’s early days for the project but I’m keen to help make it become a reality.\nInnovation in addressing mental health needs is the hallmark of another mental health project I visited last week. In case you’re wondering why the mental health focus, it was World Mental Health Day last week. I took the opportunity to visit the Recovery College Collective in Newcastle. Better known as Recoco, the college provides peer-led support and education. It supports over 2,000 people with lived experience of mental ill health. I last visited before the pandemic. Since then, they’ve had to deal with a double-whammy of supporting people through lockdown, and of finding new premises.\nCovid safety restrictions required creativity and resourcefulness – everything from moving groups and courses online, to simply going for a walk to talk to people. Alisdair, Recoco’s co-director, told me that they’ve also pioneered new ways of working with statutory mental health services. By having services in the same place, it helps people stay connected when moving between services. Take a look at their online prospectus at www.recoverycoco.com. You’ll be impressed with what they have to offer. And on top of this, they managed to find the new premises in Carliol Square in Newcastle. They’ve plans to develop this into a mental health care, treatment and research hub. What an asset to the city centre that will be.\nThe Combined Authority doesn’t have the remit for public health or treatment services of course. That lies with our local authorities and NHS. Still, supporting wellbeing and good mental health is behind everything we do. Creating meaningful jobs and tackling poverty are integral to this.\nThe theme for this year’s World Mental Health Day is “Mental health in an unequal world.” Inequality takes many forms. The relationship between poverty and poor mental health is a close one. Children in the poorest 20% of households are four times more likely to have a serious mental health condition by the age of 11 compared to those from the wealthiest 20%. Despite this, the government cut £20 per week from Universal Credit. This £1000 a year goes to working families amongst others. It has plunged an astonishing 840,000 people, including 300,000 children into poverty. It risks their physical and mental health, and strains our NHS. After ten years of austerity, mental health services have 8.5% less funding than in 2010, but demand has risen by 20%. No wonder GPs and hospitals are stretched to breaking point.\nI’m working hard with my cabinet to pull together a range of interventions to tackle poverty. We’ve developed a Child Poverty Prevention Programme for our region. This is putting £900k in projects including poverty intervention measures in schools. Our Good Work Pledge challenges the scourge of precarious employment and in-work poverty. It also requires employers to look after the mental wellbeing of their staff. Our Poverty Truth Commission, launching soon, will develop further measures to alleviate financial hardship. And, we’re working with the well-respected wellbeing authority, Carnegie UK, to become the first Combined Authority to measure wellbeing as an objective, rather than abstract economic statistics.\nGood mental health underpins our individual and collective wellbeing. I’m working to make mental health promotion a factor in everything we do at North of Tyne.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 18 Oct 2021",

First broadcast in the depths of the Thatcher recession, when I was in secondary school. The North East had lost a hundred thousand jobs in manufacturing. And along came this show with Geordie bricklayers like Dennis, Neville and Oz. It was a programme about hard working British tradesmen working abroad in horrible conditions to provide for their families. But perspective is a funny thing. Add in a bit of xenophobia, and the right-wing narrative today would be about immigrants taking the jobs of the locals.\nIt was also about the accents. It wasn’t the first TV programme to feature Geordie dialect, we’d had The Likely Lads. But growing up, it was the first time I can remember a programme where no one spoke with RP – received pronunciation. We heard Geordie, Brummie and Scouse voices. Even Wayne, the London joiner, had a working class accent instead of BBC English.\nRegional programming celebrates the diversity of British culture. Regional News is a component of devolved democracy. The Covid crisis has shown the importance of local government. Where central government has responded with indecision and U-turns, local government has delivered. Where central government has given £ billions in contracts to inept private firms with no experience, professional local government workers have fixed problems.\npoSo why then has the BBC decided to cut 450 jobs from regional news and current affairs? Inside Out is scheduled to be axed. Editorial control will be moved from Newcastle to Birmingham. Worse, journalists will be replaced by “content producers”. Investigative journalism is a key antidote to social media speculation and political spin.\nThe news team will see 8 correspondents cut to 3. They’ll now film their own stories, possibly on their phones. I’ve been interviewed enough times to see the skill needed to get the sound and lighting right, and frame a shot. To able to interview someone and ask probing questions requires concentration. Not something you can do while holding your phone with a selfie stick.\nThe new ‘local’ programmes will be covering huge areas with fewer staff. Audiences will be less well informed about stories relevant to the North East & Cumbria. We’ll see and hear fewer programmes about our lives on TV and radio\n.Local journalism, whether print, online or TV, is an essential component of local democracy. Local communities need information about what is happening in their areas. They need to know about the policies and decisions of their local representatives. They need a trusted vehicle for expressing their views. How else can we level up? Taking back control should not mean centralising. It should mean decentralising, with more local news content.\nSoon after becoming Mayor, I started this weekly column in The Journal and The Chronicle. Without strong local papers, there are few opportunities to speak directly to the residents of the North of Tyne – the people who elected me. It has played a big role in raising awareness of the new Combined Authority, the jobs we’ve created, and the difference we’re making to people’s lives.\nA month or so ago, Reach plc, which owns the Chronicle, The Journal and the Sunday Sun, announced 550 redundancies. At least 14 jobs will go in the Newcastle team. We’ll see more generic stories copied and pasted from elsewhere, instead of articles about our region. I wrote to the national CEO objecting. I received a very polite reply, saying it’s happening, our shareholders’ interests must be protected. Yet the journalists on The Chronicle and The Journal point out that Reach made £150 million profit last year.\nNews has always been biased. I’m a Labour elected Mayor in a country where 80% of the press is owned by a handful of non-taxpaying billionaires, who support the Conservative Party. If we value our democracy we must stand up for an independent press with local content. And we need the BBC – which we pay for – to stand up to government interference. Do we want to get to a situation where the only source of news is Facebook, controlled by another billionaire who avoids paying UK tax?",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_supporting-people-to-be-the-best-they-can/content_339.html": "Supporting People to be the Best They Can Be\nMay 15, 2022\nThe young man pointed to the side of his face where surgeons had inserted the metal plate. When asked if the police caught his attackers, he shrugged. No. “They were all wearing balaclavas”, he told me, flatly.\nMatthew, 16, was one of 70 budding young chefs from local colleges competing at this year’s North East Culinary and Trade Association (NECTA) awards in Gosforth’s Grand Hotel. He had almost dropped out, after his assault. “Cooking helped me cope”, he said. “After a few depressing weeks, I jumped back into it. Right after surgery, I went straight back to college and started cooking [again].”\nDouglas Jordan is a chef with decades of experience in top restaurants. He’s the driving force behind NECTA. “Would you come along and say some encouraging words, Jamie?” he asked me. “Being recognised for their skills means so much to these young people.”\nThe competition boosts the profile and quality of the North East’s hospitality trade. In a cavernous room bordered with banners promoting pizza ovens and kitchen equipment, Matthew and the next generation of Masterchefs and Michelin Star winners worked with Zen-like focus in makeshift kitchens. Above them, extractor fans roared. Around them, teachers, families, and friends watched the teenage cooks competed in their chosen category. Cold starters, hot desserts, sugarcraft, cocktail making. Judges prowled, watchful. “It’s quieter than a Glaswegian funeral!”, exclaimed the announcer, in a heavy Scottish accent.\n“Cooking is my passion”, said Jasmine, 19, from Newcastle College. She started four years ago and now gains experience – and wages – in a professional kitchen. She’s calm, softly spoken, confident. “You’ve got to put a lot of work in to make your name”, she told me. Later, her chocolate orange fondant, flambéed with orange liquor won second place in the Hot Dessert category.\nAs the day went on, the medals, trophies, and awards mounted up on college tables and around necks. Rewards reaped from years of investment. Investment by, and into, these young people. Thousands of hours of graft spent in classrooms and hot kitchens. Carving out a future. Chasing a dream.\nClearly, the competition is about so much more than just who can make the best venison terrine or decorate a cake. “Getting students involved gives them a lot of confidence and broadens their horizons”, remarked Michael Dodds, Chef Lecturer at Newcastle College, and mentor to many of the day’s winners. “It’s massively beneficial for them.”\nI left school at sixteen, the same age as many of the young chefs in that room. In the depths of the Thatcher recession, good jobs were scarce. Now, as the elected Mayor of the North of Tyne Combined Authority, my primary purpose is to create jobs. Good jobs.\nAnd creating jobs is exactly what we’re doing. Over 4,500 and counting – backed by our Good Work Pledge, which means fair pay, workers are listened to and looked after, and get the chance of training and progression. Jobs for people like Jasmine, and Matthew – who would later win joint silver for his fish preparation skills, fastidiously filleting and presenting the cuts for the judges to scrutinise. Who pushed himself to compete in a packed room, despite his horrific ordeal leaving him feeling anxious in crowds. Whose resilience, grit, and dedication will be invaluable to any employer.\nWalking around that hall, the camaraderie between the students was palpable. The tension of the competition visceral. Everywhere I looked I could see investment. A teenager who’d dedicated hundreds of hours into perfecting her craft. A teacher who’d spent years mentoring his students. Recruiters – from local companies such as the Inn Collection to national organisations like The Royal Navy – looking to invest in these young people’s futures. The event organisers putting their time and money into giving the next generation a platform, investing in their own replacements.\nPhrases like “helping them reach their full potential” are so overused they’ve become clichés. But that doesn’t mean there’s no value in them. Everything in that room that day was about exactly that: supporting people to be the best they can. When asked what inspired him, Matthew replied “I try to make myself the inspiration”. And by the end of that day, he’d done exactly that.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 16 May 22",

She brought dignity and restraint to her role. May Queen Elizabeth II rest in peace.\nSeventy years is an incredibly long time to serve as head of state. No other English or British monarch has made it to a platinum jubilee. Starting in her twenties and lasting into her late nineties. It’s no exaggeration to say it was a lifetime of public service.\nFifteen prime ministers. The first being Winston Churchill and the last Liz Truss. Two of the longest serving in British history in Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. Two of the shortest in Anthony Eden and Alec Douglas-Home.\nBearing witness to history. NUFC winning the FA Cup. Twice. The discovery of DNA. The birth of commercial television. The Suez crisis. The decolonialisation of Africa. The first motorways. Comprehensive education. The abolition of the death penalty. The Beatles. England winning the World Cup. The legalisation of abortion and homosexuality. The Race Relations Act. The Rivers of Blood speech. Concorde. Britain’s entry into the European Union. SAFC winning the FA Cup. The first test-tube baby. The winter of discontent. The rejection (and later acceptance) of devolution to Scotland and Wales. Thatcherism. Inner city riots. The Falklands War. The Miners’ Strike. Aids. The invention of the World Wide Web. The first Iraq War. The channel tunnel. The Good Friday Agreement. The second Iraq War. The London Olympics. Grenfell. Britain’s exit from the European Union. Covid.\nAll of that happened on her watch. It was exhausting just to list it all. I can’t imagine what it was like to have a front row seat. Even the way we view things has changed. At her coronation, the pictures show a sea of faces. As King Charles III arrived at Buckingham Palace, there was instead a sea of arms – people holding up their phones to video it for posterity.\nThe country changed profoundly during Queen Elizabeth II’s reign. Some of it for the better. Some for the worse. We are more socially liberal than in 1952. Women’s and LGBTQ+ rights have improved immeasurably. Few people think your gender, race or sexuality are legitimate grounds for persecution – though sadly not yet everyone. But we’re also a more economically unequal country than we were then. The average property price in 1952 was, in today’s money, £40,000. Now it’s £260,000. Poverty and homelessness abound in the UK – the 5th richest country in the world. Health is better, thanks to medical technology. In 1952 80% of adults smoked, 15% smoke today. But despite the rise of gyms and fun-runs, obesity has risen from 2% to 28%.\nThe Queen was our head of state, not our head of government. She wasn’t a politician. Her role was to represent Britain ceremonially, and facilitate the democratic changing of the guard. The head of state ensures a peaceful transfer of power between different parties and political leaders. Her impartiality as head of state shows the professionalism she brought to her role. She had a weekly audience with people as different as Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher, and still managed to put her own opinions aside. Mind you, she did send some subtle messages. When Donald Trump visited Britain in July 2018, the Queen chose to wear a brooch given to her by the Obamas. Maybe she gave out a whole heap of coded messages we were oblivious to.\nHer presence on the national stage helped give people a sense of stability, particularly at times of great upheaval. She had an 86% approval rating – far more than any politician could ever dream to have. That’s partly because she kept her opinions out of the public arena.\nIt’s a sad moment for any family when their mother, grandmother or great-grandmother dies. The Royal Family is no different. They will need to grieve in private as well as in public. Millions of people will want to pay their respects too and mourn Queen Elizabeth II in their own way. We should also recognise that many in our nation feel differently about having a monarch at all, and respect their right to feel differently. Let’s give each other the time and space we need.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 12 Sept 2022",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_72-of-children-in-poverty-are-from-working-families/content_241.html": "72% of Children in Poverty are from Working Families\nJanuary 13, 2021\nDemocracy is a powerful idea. Everyone gets an equal say, no matter your background or your wealth. It took a lot of fighting for – the landed nobility did not roll over willingly. Many campaigners were hanged, transported or killed in battle. The events in Washington DC this week show we can’t take it for granted.\nInsurrectionists in the Capitol last week waved Confederate flags. The Antebellum South was a democracy – in the sense that it held elections. Of course, women couldn’t vote. And slaves were chattels – property. If you were a woman slave, your children were the legal property of your owner the moment they were born.\nEven Ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy, had slavery. Unlike the race-based slavery of the Americas, an Athenian slave had more legal protection. Striking a slave was illegal, and could be prosecuted. Killing a slave was punished with the death penalty.\nIn practice, there was little difference between a poor citizen and fortunate slave. Athenian slaves could run businesses, and give a share of the profits to their owners. Compare that with the modern practice of shareholding.\nIn Athens there was very little slave trading, and slavery was not hereditary. Debt bondage was a common route into slavery. If you were in debt, you were enslaved to your creditor until you could repay him.\nThe view that working for wages is akin to slavery dates back to the ancient world.\nSaid the Roman statesman Cicero, “”the very wage workers receive is a pledge of their slavery”. In today’s Britain, we may have the freedom to choose not to work, but the freedom to starve is no freedom at all. And many who do work still use foodbanks. 72% of children in poverty are from working families.\nAbolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass – whose freedom was bought by the people of Newcastle – concluded, “experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other”. Two and a half centuries on, and wage slavery is still with us.\nNo discussion of wage slavery can pass up a quotation from Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx’s best drinking bud. “The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly. The individual slave, property of one master, is assured an existence,\nhowever miserable it may be, because of the master’s interest. The individual proletarian, property as it were of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labour only when someone has need of it, has no secure existence.”\nThere’s the root of the problem. The drive, for the past forty years at least, for a “flexible labour market”, that no government of any party has challenged. I’ve never known any campaigner or trade unionist argue against increasing productivity or profitability. What they argue against is being forced into a marginal existence. Zero-hours contracts and bogus self-employment are rife.\nThe North of Tyne, like many progressive organisations, has a Modern Slavery policy. You have to ask: what is wrong with our world that we even need such a policy?\nSlavery today, as in Ancient Athens, is based on debt. Interest is a way of transferring wealth from poor people to rich people.\nThat’s why I stand in solidarity with the owners of small businesses, who are working their socks off, often to repay interest. They have to take life-changing risks, like putting their house up as collateral. Contrast that with our government who have allowed the three million #excludedUK – small business owners and self-employed – to fall through the gap during this pandemic. No wonder the Prime Minister is famous for saying, “f*ck business”. And it wasn’t “feck”.\nThe Labour Party has a massive opportunity here. The vast majority of businesses in the UK are precarious small businesses. Not just workers forced into self-employment, like in Ken Loach’s Sorry We Missed You. But most small businesses are precarious, and many struggle to get paid on time by corporations.\nAnyone who has to keep working to avoid penury is a worker. Even workers who are earning a good living have very little choice but to continue. To quote Fight Club, “Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we don’t need. We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we’ll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won’t.”\nAs Noam Chomsky says, “representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere.”\nWhat does democracy mean to a care worker juggling two jobs on minimum wage who never gets to read her daughter a bed-time story? Or the owner of a small business who is about to go bust because a large corporate customer still hasn’t paid their invoice, 120 days after it was due. Or to parents who are financially secure, but worried about their son leaving university with £60,000 of debt just for getting educated? Not so long ago, education was seen as a public good.\nWhole swathes of essential services and utilities are governed not by us, as citizens, but by the needs of distant shareholders, often based in tax havens. Philip Alston, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, said, “Abandoning people to the private market in relation to a service that affects every dimension of their basic well-being is incompatible with human rights requirements.”\nYou got to vote for a government who’ve just decided that all those council keyworkers aren’t allowed a pay rise to match inflation. But you aren’t allowed a vote on whether the CEO of Ocado is worth his £58 million pay packet. The only way you get to vote on that, is to be rich and own enough shares.\nThe American philosopher of pragmatism, John Dewey, said that until “industrial feudalism” is replaced by “industrial democracy”, politics will be “the shadow cast on society by big business.”\nDonald Trump’s climate change denying campaign was funded by fossil fuel companies. Jeremy Corbyn faced relentless assault from the British press, eighty percent of which is owned by a handful of billionaire tax-exiles who don’t live in Britain.\nEconomic democracy is a simple idea. It means the people who do the work, get paid for the work. And profits get reinvested, not extracted for financial bubbles like share buybacks.\nThat means more local business. A level playing field for small businesses. More cooperatives and worker owned businesses. And an active role for workers in the management of a company, through the role of trade unions. That means repealing Britain’s anti-democratic trade union laws. It means bringing our public services back into public ownership – democratic ownership, where workers and service users get to shape them. It means ending tax dodging.\nBut the first thing is to put economic democracy on the agenda. So little of this is ever addressed in public discourse. We argue about the personalities, and judge their media performances. Boris is good because he used three word slogans. Oh hang on, he’s now bad because he keeps U-turning. Meanwhile, the real power of money goes unquestioned.\nExpect the guardians of the status quo to object to any debate that seriously threatens their source of power.\nAs the Brazilian priest Helda Camera said, “When I gave food to the poor, they called me a saint. When I asked why the poor have no food, they called me a communist.”\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 11.1.21",

I will now serve the people of Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland as the Independent North of Tyne Mayor. I’ve attached a copy of the letter.\nHundreds of people have asked me to run for North East Mayor. The election is May 2024. I’m North of Tyne Mayor now, but the Labour Party HQ in London has blocked me for factional reasons – and people are outraged. They are tired of being controlled by Westminster and Party HQs. They want someone to stand up for them. They want a strong, experienced voice for the North East. People have stopped me in the street asking me to run.\nEven if you don’t live in the North East, this all still affects you. Our politics is a mess and millions of people feel no one speaks for them. Politicians should answer to the electorate – not to party bosses in London HQs. The only ‘whip’ should be the people.\nAs North East Mayor I’ll deliver a Total Transport Network, create a job for everyone who wants one, and deliver a Green New Deal.\nMy track record shows what’s possible. I’ve been North of Tyne Mayor since 2019. Despite the pandemic and national economic chaos, my team and I have worked with businesses to create over 5,000 new jobs, backed by our Good Work Pledge. We’ve built affordable homes in urban and rural areas. Implemented a Green New Deal and invested in offshore wind. And delivered our Child Poverty Prevention Programme, hailed as an exemplar of best practice.\nI put results first – I work cross-party and don’t play daft political games. That’s how I landed our new expanded devolution deal to unite the North and South of the Tyne. It gets us £billions to improve our region’s transport system.\nI understand the cost of living crisis many of us are facing, I’ve claimed £0 in expenses and not charged a penny in council tax.\nYou’d think the Labour Leadership would shout about my successes – but it seems they only want candidates who’ll do what they’re told by Party HQ.\nI didn’t become a politician until I was 48. I’m an engineer. Fixing broken systems is what I do. I value patriotism – and believe it’s expressed by public service, not xenophobia. My Dad drove a tank in the army, my brother served in the navy at the time of the Falklands.\nMy politics are simple – Britain should be run in the interests of the people who do the work. Including those unable to work, and retired from a lifetime of work. It’s not left-wing. It’s not right-wing. It’s common sense.\nAs an independent, I won’t have a big party machinery behind me with a national press office. I’ll need £150k for a full election campaign to match theirs. If I can raise £25k by the end of August, I’ll run. If I don’t hit that target, I won’t run. The decision is yours. Here is a link to my campaign fund DONATE.\nThis is not a time for faint hearts. It’s a time for bravery. If you back me, I will run. If I run, we can win. Shy bairns get nowt.\nHere is a link to my letter Dear Sir Keir",

She probably saw me as one of the “moaning minnies” because I objected to the devastation she wrought on my community.\nHer policies pushed unemployment above 3 million for the first time in British history.\n248,000 jobs destroyed in the North East over her 11 years as Prime Minister. My Dad’s included.\nSteelworks, wagon works, and of course, the mines.\nSir Keir knew exactly what he was doing. You don’t have a few too many on a Saturday night and accidentally write an article in The Sunday Telegraph. It’s not a misstep like his Gaza siege comment that Israel had the right to cut off power and water to Palestinians. It’s a deliberate act, like his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza or call a war crime a war crime.\nIt’s also the second time he’s praised Baroness Thatcher. On 23rd March this year he praised her approach to law and order. Despite the waves of inner city rioting. Or epidemic of joy riding. And I doubt the Hillsborough families think highly of her cover ups. Or that gay people persecuted under Section 28 share Sir Keir’s praise. Crime rose by 37% through the Thatcher years.\nAt best he’s cynically fishing for votes in an ever-smaller pond of Tory voters.\nAt worst it’s because the Leader of the Opposition has no plan. The day after praising Margaret Thatcher his website took down his “ten pledges”. It now says “404 – page not found”.\nThatcherism continued without Thatcher. “Setting loose our natural entrepreneurialism” was really just privatisation. Mr Blair put PFI on steroids – hobbling hospitals with debt for decades. Our private utilities extracted £billions to tax havens and failed to build new reservoirs or transmission networks. Council house stock halved, the cause of today’s housing crisis.\nThe world has changed since Margaret Thatcher’s election in 1979, or Tony Blair’s in 1997. Thatcherism depended on selling off public assets. Blairism rode a wave of under-regulated banking profits until the bubble inevitably burst, landing us with the bill.\nNeither approach is credible today. Lord Cameron, now back as Foreign Secretary, is our longest-serving Prime Minister since the global financial crisis. He lasted 6 years, but only 1 with a majority. Gordon Brown, Theresa May, and Boris Johnson had 3 years each. Liz Truss had 49 days and was outlasted by a lettuce. Rishi Sunak has survived a year so far.\nWhat links their fates is that none has been able to raise living standards for the majority of Britons. And then either the electorate or their own party punished their failure. Until we move away from continuity Thatcherism, we will see no political stability.\nI absolutely want a thriving private sector. And with over 5,000 new jobs created by the North of Tyne’s investments our record is strong.\nIf you’re running essential infrastructure, though, public interest must come before shareholder profit. What’s happened to our public sector? Is anything left of it? Schools, crumbling. NHS suffering chronic privatisation.\nOur councils are barely standing. 1 in 5 council leaders and chief executives say they’ll run out of money next year. Many will go bankrupt.\nI hold campaign meetings right across the North East. Last Tuesday in Ryton I asked a packed audience who would trust Mr Sunak to honour a promise. No one put their hand up. And who would trust Sir Keir? No hands. Then, slowly, one gentleman put his hand up. He approached me afterwards. “I do believe Starmer when he says he won’t turn on the taps,” he said.\nThis is where the silence is really deafening. Anyone who fails to challenge Sir Keir’s continuity Thatcherism is unfit to represent the North East.\nBefore he’s killed in Shakespeare’s play, Julius Caesar is warned to, “Beware the ides of March.” He brushes off the soothsayer’s prophecy and doesn’t give them a second thought. And then soon afterwards, everyone turns on him.\nLabour and Sir Keir should take note.",

However…\nA report by the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) points out that at current rates it will take 700 years to hit zero-carbon heating. The PM’s plans are based on current electricity usage. Renewables now account for 40% of the UK’s electricity. But electricity accounts for only 12% of UK energy use. That leaves 95% of UK energy not coming from renewables. Demand for electricity will increase as we shift from gas heating and hot water to electricity. Not to mention the move to electric vehicles. That’s going to cost a wee bit more than £160 million.\nUKERC’s report also stresses that relying on consumers to replace their central heating systems won’t cut the mustard either. There’ll need to be a mixture of regulations for new homes and financial incentives. The government’s new Planning White Paper says new houses must be “zero-carbon ready”. I met with Robert Jenrick last week, Secretary of State for Housing, and asked why “zero-carbon ready”? Why not zero-carbon now? Parliamentary legislation should be judged on actions, not aspirations.\nOn the positive side, he did listen to me on MMC housing. That’s Modern Methods of Construction. Basically, engineered timber that’s fireproof, warm, quick to build and extremely strong. And of course, locks away carbon in its structure. A typical new build house releases 65 tonnes of carbon. A typical MMC house locks away 27 tonnes.\nSo, what does “investing in offshore wind” mean in practice?\nThe Tyne has companies building and transporting turbine jackets – the massive criss-cross steel legs that sit in the sea. They’re fixed to the seabed and support the turbines. The further out to sea they are, the windier it gets, which is what you want, but that does present engineering challenges.\nIt’s extremely difficult to get a crane big enough to haul a horizontal jacket to vertical in the middle of the sea. So jackets have to be transported upright. The problem is the National Grid cables cross the river at Jarrow, 84m above the water level. So yards on the Tyne can’t bid for work on these large new turbines. They simply won’t fit underneath the cables.\nIf the cables ran under the river instead of over it, we could make our region the world leader in offshore wind manufacture. It’ll cost £100m to run the cables under the Tyne. We have the expertise – from design through fabrication to installation – right here on the Tyne. All £100m of that project could be delivered by companies in our region, creating local jobs\nI’ve spoken to the companies involved, and they are unanimous in their support. If the government releases the funding, we could get cracking right now.\nBut what would make more of a difference than anything else is for government to enforce the local content regulation. In order to site wind turbines in UK waters, electricity generating companies are supposed to give 60% of the work to UK firms. They don’t. Enforcing this could make more of a difference than anything else. There’s a £40 billion pipeline of work in this sector already.\nEight of the companies on the north bank of the Tyne, upstream of the electricity cables, directly employ over 2000 staff and have an annual turnover of more than £500m. This is small potatoes compared to the number of jobs and money that could be created- and kept – in our region. They’ve all told me they would invest heavily if the UK government enforced the local content regulations and moved the cables underground.\nWe’ve submitted this plan to the government, as part of the comprehensive spending review.\nSo come on Boris, complete your Damscene conversion, blow the skin off your chequebook, and invest in the North East.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 12.10.20",

I’m not going to rehash the arguments why they cannot win the next General Election. Even in Rochdale where Labour withdrew their candidate, the Tories came third.\nSo the question isn’t who will win. It’s what happens afterwards.\nThe cost of living crisis is not temporary. People are still poorer than they were in 2008. 14 years of Conservative austerity has left 7.5 million people waiting for NHS treatment. 3.6 million children in poverty. Small businesses struggle against global corporations. Leisure centres continue to close. Local councils going bankrupt across the country. Devoid of credibility, the Tories are betting the farm on culture wars.\nPeople want a Labour government to be the light at the end of the tunnel. What have the Labour leadership offered? The magic growth bunny. It will hop along, and Britain will boom.\nNo need to invest in public services. The magic growth bunny will fix the crisis in social care. The sick will walk. Greenhouse gases will chill out.\nNo need to equalise capital gains with income tax. No need for a 1% wealth tax on people worth more than £10,000,000. No need to stop our energy and water companies channelling billions of our money to overseas tax havens. The magic growth bunny will lay golden eggs. Don’t ask how, that’s just playing into Tory hands. Trust Keir. Keir would never lie to you. It’s all about economic competence, right?\nWrong. If it was, they wouldn’t have blocked me. An incumbent Mayor who’d created over 5,000 permanent jobs, built 2,000 homes, increased training courses from 22,000 to 35,000 year, and run child poverty prevention programmes in over 100 schools. All without a penny on council tax or any borrowing. My economic record had lifelong Tory voters writing to the local paper saying they’d vote for me.\nLabour HQ had already decided to block me before I talked to legendary film maker Ken Loach about films. Months earlier, they emailed me denying my automatic right to contact Labour members, unless I promised not to run again as Mayor. There are lots of good people in the Labour Party. But they’re frozen out.\nThe go-to rationalisation is, “The worst Labour government is better than the best Tory government.” I get the logic. It even makes sense, if you think time stops the day after the general election. But it doesn’t.\nIndustrial unrest is a response to the arithmetic of your pay packet. When teachers, doctors, nurses, rail workers, posties, firefighters, ambulance drivers, civil servants, council workers and, well, just about everyone else, sees that light at the end of the tunnel is just another train, they won’t be patient.\nThe danger of short-term thinking is it ignores long-term effects. Austerity was sold as balancing the books: take some pain now, and be better off in future. The reality is that a modern economy depends on effective public services. Or in real life terms, when teachers and nurses need food banks, our kids’ education suffers, people stay sick, and our long term national income stagnates.\nA Starmer government that fails to quickly improve lives will till the soil for the far right.\nOutside of Westminster elections people are already choosing another option. Independents, Greens, and a slew of local community parties are winning up and down the country.\nTo paraphrase Trainspotting: Choose life. Choose jobs. Choose NHS workers not too exhausted to work. Choose fair rents. Choose a wealth tax. Choose utilities run in the sustainable interests of the people of Britain, not overseas billionaires.\nThat’s why I’m backing Green New Deal Rising and We Deserve Better. Farage pulled the Tories to the right, and Labour with them. Someone needs to pull back.\nElecting me as North East Mayor on May 2nd to bring public transport under public control, free for everyone 18 and under, will reduce emissions, boost our economy, and reduce inequality.\nEven if We Deserve Better candidates win all their target seats, Labour will still form the next Government.\nBut the sooner we upset the status quo, the sooner we will get a fair voting system, and start to run Britain in the interests of the people who do the work.",

This means making sure people have the education and skills to get the jobs, creating the jobs and making the right conditions for business to thrive.\nTo do all of this means having a great relationship with business. I’ve worked in a large businesses and I’ve set up my own business from scratch.\nSoon after I was elected Rhona from P&G came to see me. She was really up-front, and told me her colleagues had said, “don’t waste your time. Nothing happens for years if you talk to government.” Well, within months we had our Advanced Circular Economy Project up and running, creating high-tech jobs, developing domestic cleaning products to use less heat and water.\nBritain’s five and a half million small business owners should be natural Labour voters. Like us, they want a level playing field. We’ve helped over 1700 small businesses with advice and support or direct investment. We helped a local cycling firm develop an internet savvy customer journey, so they can increase their sales of eco-holidays, and employ more staff. We’ve helped a local joinery firm digitise their production. They’ve employed more joiners and apprentices, and are exporting to Japan. This is investment in the real economy – in firms that pay their taxes and pay their workers properly.\nBusinesses which recognise that their employees are their greatest asset embrace our Good Work Pledge. That’s why it is backed by the CBI and the North East Chamber of Commerce.\nWe’re working with the National Innovation Centre for Data to boost the growth of Digital start-ups, and investing £5 million with the National Innovation Centre for Ageing to boost start-ups in technology to keep us healthy life-long.\nOur Innovation Recovery Grants are aimed at small businesses and social enterprises. There’s up to £10,000 available per project. When we think about innovation we tend to think of high-tech products, new materials, computer systems. But really innovation is about doing something in a way it’s not been done before.\nWe’ve got the North of Tyne Growth Fund. It does what it says on the tin: capital funding to support SMEs looking to expand or establish new operations in Newcastle, North Tyneside, or Northumberland. Grants of up to 30% of your eligible expenditure are available.\nI visited Merit Holdings in June. Our £250,000 is helping them to reinvent their approach to construction. They do modular constructions. Clean rooms for biotech. They bought new automation equipment. Robot welding. A new factory. 100 new jobs and a large apprenticeship programme. Hopefully another 150 people employed in the next 12 months. They now manufacture everything in Cramlington.\nThey’re also down the road from Sweet Dreams – a local confectionary company. Our £92,000 helped them to buy new equipment, hire 10 staff, break into new markets, and make better chocolate. They’ve got plans for vegan and plant-based chocolates. And their Choc Nibbles are delicious!\nOur funding is not limited to businesses based in the towns and cities of our region. We have the Rural Business Growth Service to target support to those outside the urban core.\nWe helped Glendale Engineering in Wooler who specialise in manufacturing livestock equipment. Our £42,000 grant helped them to buy a new plant and hire 11 new staff. They can now take on larger scale projects and start delivery faster than before.\nI want to stay plugged into everything affecting the business community. I talk directly to business owners and I have my quarterly Business Ambassador to the Mayor meetings. This is with the CBI, North East Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, TechUK and MadeUK. They tell me what their members and research is telling them so we can work together to do the best for our businesses.",

Last Monday I met trade minister Lord Grimstone for dinner. We discussed getting more Government support to bring investment here. On Wednesday I met the Vice President and the European Ops director of a US firm over coffee. The meeting was a success, and fingers crossed, they’ll be creating 150 new jobs in the North of Tyne. Efficient though Zoom may be, there’s no substitute for an in-person meeting.\nShifting from international to local, I spent part of Monday visiting community enterprises in Newcastle’s West End. The invitation came from Mayor Habib Rahman. When I was councillor for Monument Ward in the City Centre, our wards were adjacent, and we worked together on several issues. Habib is Newcastle’s first ever civic leader from the BAME community. This is a big deal not only locally but also back in Bangladesh where Habib’s parents hail from.\nWe both have the title Mayor, but the roles are different. As Mayor of a combined authority I might be the one with the budget and can pull a few more levers, but Mayor Rahman has got the swankier office by far. Not to mention the bling.\nOur first stop was Elswick Pool. I used to swim there decades ago. You’ll remember that in 2010 the coalition Government had a political decision to make. They chose to cut public services, triple tuition fees, and let keyworkers’ wages fall. In return, they pumped hundreds of billions of pounds into increasing financial assets like the FTSE index and commercial property. And David Cameron said we were all in it together.\nLocally, Elswick Pool got the chop. Kids missed out on swimming lessons. Adults missed out on fitness. The community lost a vital hub. And the workers lost their jobs.\nLocal people got organised. They campaigned, and set up a charity. They learned from Jesmond Pool. Diane, a leading campaigner is now on the management board of a thriving social enterprise, owned by its community. It’s a labour of love, she told me. It employs nine members of staff and supports twenty six part time roles such as swimming coaches. Twenty schools now have swimming lessons there. There are dedicated sessions for women to swim, and hydrotherapy for people with disabilities. The pool’s manager, Phil, described how it’s now a buzzing community hub, helping people get fitter and lose weight.\nNext stop was the Millin Charity, in the Beacon Centre – the old fire station on the West Road. Run by Shewley and Kirsty, it helps women establish businesses. (And Sarah, who’s on maternity leave). For twenty years now they’ve built up trust and contacts throughout their community. Women from all backgrounds can just drop in or pick up the phone. They run sessions on business planning, financial advice, and the legal hurdles of being in business. We spoke about how it can scaled up. How it was that they’d been able to change the way these women see themselves, and find confidence to transform their lives.\nAnd it works. Every year, they work with around 200 women. On average this results in 30 women setting up a business or becoming self-employed. Everything from cake or dress making, to business support services. A further 20 find employment. 45 more go on to further training and education.\nThe stories of Elswick Pool and the Millin Charity share something with the US investors I met. They are about entrepreneurship. With no reliable funding, with no rich backers, both social enterprises are creating jobs out of nothing more than goodwill and solidarity. And making people’s lives better in the process.\nThe democratic socialism that I believe in is massively entrepreneurial. It’s also about levelling the playing field. The difference is it’s about making sure that central Government doesn’t tilt the table in favour the corporations with lobbyists on big bucks. Or hand out contracts to people you went to Eton with.\nWhen we nurture the people in our communities, they step up and succeed. That’s why we’re bringing forward a plan to back social enterprises, here in the North of Tyne.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 30 August 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_culture-for-the-soul/content_186.html": "Culture for the Soul\nJune 15, 2020\nCulture is the sum total of how we express ourselves as humans. Culture is our collective soul.\nFor some it’s theatre, museums, art galleries, opera. For others, a live music gig, a beer festival or a home game.\nI don’t see culture as a “sector”, an opportunity for economic growth. We can live in concrete blocks and eat nutrient paste to sustain our bodies. But we need architecture and cuisine to sustain our souls. Enriching our lives is an end in itself.\nIn the North East, we’ve got wealth of theatres, exhibition spaces and venues. This month you could have expected to see The Mousetrap at the Theatre Royal. Listened to an amazing range of music styles at the Sage. Attended the Viking exhibition at the Bailiffgate in Alnwick. Delved into the Tynemouth market at the weekend. There would have been football at St James’s and even (whisper it…) at the Stadium of Light. None of this happened. We don’t know when they will reopen, or if they will ever return to the way it was before the virus struck.\nWe do know that people working in culture are poorly paid. For every Premiership footballer, Hollywood star or best selling author, there are thousands who live hand to mouth.\nSo, what is going to happen?\nReal cultural diversity comes from the interchange of ideas, experiences and influences. We should develop our local culture, rather than thinking that everyone wants generic, cookie-cutter events.\nI hope I’m not coming over too Royston Vasey – ‘this is local festival for local people…’. But look at the difference the Edinburgh Festival and the Fringe have made to that city. All the performers who’ve honed their skills and got their break there. Or the Whitby Goth Weekend, which celebrates a sub-culture that connects people, and supports the local economy.\nA week-long festival, or even a single day event, can be all year in the planning. The Great North Run employs a full-time team year round. These are meaningful jobs with a great sense of purpose.\nSpeaking of Royston Vasey, The League of Gentlemen has been dropped by Netflix. There’s been a rush by broadcasters and streaming services to distance themselves from anything that smacks of racism, or cultural appropriation. Quite right too. But blanket bans miss the point. The League of Gentlemen was never meant to be a cosy, family sitcom, like Terry and June, or My Family. It was deliberately intended to be dark – to shock and offend – as well as being clever and funny.\nIt’s a delicate balance. We have to avoid propagating bigoted views. But there’s still a place for the sort of humour that makes you wince at the same time as laughing. Good art should challenge our perceptions of the world.\nWould we ban The Merchant of Venice because of the sixteenth century anti-Semitic sentiments? Would we ban the Old Testament for its homophobia? Should we edit Mein Kampf to make it less offensive? Airbrushing history is to pretend that the world never thought like that. A better alternative is to explain why it’s offensive. We should not dodge these uncomfortable debates around racism, we should win them.\nHBO has temporarily taken down Gone With The Wind. For a story set on a cotton plantation, it’s effectively blind to the slavery and racial oppression. Hattie McDaniel, who played Mammy, was the first African-American to win an Oscar. Yet she was not allowed to sit with her fellow stars at the Oscars ceremony, because of the segregation at the time. HBO said, ” it will return with a discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those depictions, but will be presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.”\nBack to Royston Vasey, (local funding for local people…). My Cabinet and I have allocated £8.4m for our culture and events strategy. We’ll need to revisit it post-COVID. With people flying less, domestic tourism will increase. One component is to bring major events, like the Rugby Magic Weekend, to St James’ Park. A key plank is developing home-grown festivals, to showcase local talent, local people, and local small businesses. Rooting in the landscape, history and culture of our region creates a virtuous circle. It creates an ecosystem for our cultural sector. It gives people a chance to develop their careers here, in our region. It keeps money in our local economy. And best of all, with a profusion of great events – food, literary, music, sport, community – the lot – it will make this a better, more fun place to live.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 15.6.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_mature-relationships-get-things-done/content_218.html": "Mature Relationships Get Things Done\nDecember 13, 2020\nIt’s said that the distance between the Government and Opposition benches in the House of Commons is two swords lengths, to stop them stabbing each other. If you watch some of the debates, it’s probably just as well.\nPrime Minister’s Question time is meant to be the opportunity for MPs to question the Prime Minister, and raise issues from their own constituencies. In practice it’s an exercise in point-scoring. The media join in, scoring the PM and the Leader of the Opposition on their performances. The focus is on who ‘won’, rather than finding the truth.\nI made these points at a “Leadership in the 21st Century” event a few weeks back. I was asked why we don’t have better politicians.\nThere are three main reasons.\nFirstly – the appearance doesn’t match the reality. Do you remember the headline, “MP handles niche local issue competently”? No. And you never will. 99% of politics doesn’t get reported. It’s not newsworthy. Barring a few egregious exceptions, politicians are pretty good at the bread and butter. And most work hard – from ward councillors through to cabinet ministers.\nSecondly – politics in government is more difficult than it looks.\nCouncil leaders, mayors and ministers have to be on top of a vast amount of subject matter.\nI can go from a meeting about the Castleford Corridor in Manchester’s rail system because it impacts on services to Newcastle, to the pipeline of brownfield housing sites, and how we’ll get spades in the ground before Xmas. Next, a review of the Kickstarter partnership with DWP officials, then speak on a panel about the future of offshore wind, before chairing a strategy session on economic recovery. Then meet with a minister about international trade. All before lunch time.\nYou need to understand legal ramifications and budgetary implications. To speed read hundreds of pages of briefings. You have to build working relationships with people in the space of a few minutes. To go on live TV with no advanced warning of what you might be asked.\nYou have to deliver a vision based on values with only half the resources you need. You’re operating in an environment where the future is unknown but you’re responsible for planning for it. You need the courage to lead and the wisdom to listen. The world and his dog want a slice of your time. You have to display dignity in the face of abuse. You need to be the living embodiment of Kipling’s “If-“\nTo be all this, and someone who is witty, charismatic and photogenic is unrealistic. People expect Hollywood heroes, and are disappointed when they get humans.\nThirdly – our politics is deliberately adversarial.\nIt’s set up to be a win-lose game. Too often, people vote for the image, not the substance. It’s amplified by spin doctors. Their job is to help their politicians win the next election.\nWe saw it with Bernhard Ingham under Thatcher, Alistair Campbell / Malcolm Tucker under Blair, Andy Coulston under Cameron and Dominic Cummings under Johnson.\nIt is reinforced by the Whip system. MPs are corralled to be “on message”.\nNews media are businesses. Even the BBC chases ratings. Politics is entertainment. Producers and journalists have too little time. Clicks-per-story can be measured precisely. The pressure to sensationalise is intense. Nuanced debate is lost. You’re expected to inform the public in one sound bite.\nAs a Mayor I’m lucky. My mandate is direct from you. I don’t have to throw red meat to keep my backbenchers on side. There is no shadow mayor trying to slide tackle me with studs showing every week.\nMy job requires building alliances to get things done. My cabinet has the leaders and deputies from the three local authorities. I have to align the business organisations, trade unions, voluntary sector and public services. As a Labour Mayor, I work with Conservative ministers to find the win-win.\nIt’s notable how the mayors who used to be MPs describe this. “I feel like I’m dealing with grown-ups now,” one said. “Westminster was all about taking sides.” He was talking as much about politics within parties as between them.\nWe need to learn from this. To change politics, we need to change the way politicians have to work.\nOriginally Published in The Journal and Evening Chronicle 14.12.20",

At the current rate, we’re going to break that limit in just over two years.\n“The Government must get real on delivery… Continue to be slow and timid and the opportunity will slip from our hands.” So says Lord Deben, chair of the independent, statutory Climate Change Committee, established by the 2008 Climate Change Act.\nTheir report last week praised the government’s promises. But was damning when it examined the evidence of delivering on them. All bluster and no bite. The policies don’t back up the rhetoric. They are gambling everything on one report due out in the Autumn – the Net Zero Strategy. It had better be good because Britain’s global credibility rests on it. Not to mention our future. And it had better be on time, before COP26 in November.\nLast week was a big week for the North of Tyne Combined Authority. We held our first Green Economy Summit, bringing partners from across the region together to shape our future. Industry, research, public services, and universities were all involved.\nCovid and the climate crisis have caused us to rethink how our economy works. It can no longer be about rising share prices or housing bubbles. It’s about a secure future for everyone. That’s how we take people with us. We build a Zero-Carbon, Zero-Poverty North East.\nOur devolved skills programme is giving everyone a chance. We fund vocational skills like getting an HGV license or technical skills that lead to high-paying jobs. And we’ve put £2 million aside for those in high-carbon industries to retrain in clean energy and the jobs of the future.\nOur SpaceHive crowdfunder directly funds community groups to green their places and tackle food poverty. Our Citizens Assembly on Climate Change has produced its recommendations which we’re already acting on. Our Good Work Pledge underpins the thousands of jobs we’re creating. It values the good employers in our region because they value the people who do the work.\nWe need better connections into and out of our region. We’re in a crazy situation where the East Coast Mainline is so constrained by its Victorian infrastructure that we can’t benefit from HS2 or Northern Powerhouse rail until we get the funding to reopen the Leamside line.\nTo top it all, there is a planned timetable table change to go from two trains per hour to Manchester, down to one per hour. It’ll reduce services to Morpeth and Berwick. Reducing connectivity between northern towns and cities is the opposite of levelling up.\nI’ve pushed back hard. At Wednesday’s Rail North Committee I managed to get agreement to halt the changes. Now we need the Department for Transport to step in.\nLast Monday I spoke to the Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps. I made all these points. You know what he said? “Jamie, your nothing if not consistent. You make that point every time we speak.” Well good, because it’s been too long since people listened to our region, and I’m going keep fighting our corner.\nAnd of course, we need to decarbonise our energy.\nWe’re investing £25 million in our offshore wind and subsea sector. Improving infrastructure, like stronger cranes to handle bigger turbines. And we’re investing in minewater heating, to turn our high-carbon past into a low-carbon future.\nOur Green New Deal, our offshore wind investment, our high-tech start-up programmes, our partnership with BritishVolt, our reopening the Northumberland Line. Creating over 4,000 jobs, and counting.\nThe Combined Authority I lead is delivering on climate action and creating good green jobs, right now.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 28 June 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_its-all-about-the-power/content_68.html": "It’s all about the power\nDecember 8, 2019\nLast Monday I was in Manchester when the Tory Party conference was in town. I haven’t crossed the floor, it was a meeting of the M9. It sounds like something from a Bond film. Whenever we meet I think of SPECTRE – me and the other 8 Metro Mayors sitting round a huge table, working out the best way to get central government to give powers and funding back to England’s regions. Sadiq Khan stroking a white cat. Well, maybe not that bit.\nA fortnight ago the Prime Minister announced the North of Tyne would get additional devolved powers. We’ve been chasing up civil servants to find out how and when, and it’s fair to say the PM’s team is making up policy on the hoof. Government at the moment is more Austin Powers than James Bond. We were offered a sketchy deal about as clear as the government’s plan for solving the Northern Ireland border. But our civil servants have been diligent, and the political unity from the mayors is impressive. Neither Labour nor Tory Mayor was happy with the initial offer, and collectively as the M9 we have approached the government with a request for a clear devolution framework: a process that would see significant powers and budgets devolved to the North of Tyne, which we could draw-down when we are ready to manage them. That’s the power of having directly-elected leaders with a clear focus on their own regions. If we’re to get beyond divisive politics as a country, devolution has to play its part. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have it. We should too.\nOn a positive note, the lobbying to get democratic control of the Shared Prosperity Fund seems to be paying off. Robert Jenrick, secretary of state for local government, confirmed that I would get direct control of the money that will replace EU funding when – or if – Brexit happens. Whether Leaver or Remainer, we can all agree that direct control of our funding is better for our area. Regional control would enable us to really power up the North.\nWhat could I do with these powers? Sort our public transport for one thing. Over the last thirty years, since bus deregulation under the Thatcher government, bus patronage has dropped in the North East by half. In the same time period, London’s bus use has doubled. Why? Because Transport for London was never deregulated. With the power to regulate the bus system we can get joined up ticketing, like London has. Just rock-up, swipe on with your debit card, and use the Metro or the bus, and it automatically charges you the best fare. You don’t even need a ticket, which speeds up journey times.\nI’d like to go further – to integrate all transport into a single app, so you can hire an electric bike at Metro stations, and upgrade the bus fleet to take your folding bike on with you. If you want to go away for the weekend, you could hire a car from a car club and pick it up where you live. There’s too much focus and spending on road improvement – the best solution to our air quality and climate crisis is to think about moving people around instead of cars.\nImagine if public transport and electric bike infrastructure was so good that it was quicker than driving. Imagine if you could save the cost of your car insurance, fuel, servicing and road tax. Not to mention the depreciation on your car. I’m working to bring these powers here, and the noises coming out of government are positive. The good news is, it doesn’t require primary legislation – an Act of Parliament – we can have the powers transferred by ministerial order. Whether these ministers will be around long enough to deliver is a different matter. Mind you, if we get a Labour government, we’ll get all the investment we need in public transport.\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Newcastle Evening Chronicle on Monday 7th October 2019.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_softly-softly-catchee-4-27-billion/content_254.html": "Softly, Softly, Catchee £4.27 Billion\nMarch 19, 2023\n“Text Michael Gove”, read the tweet from @BlaydonBarney (no surname or profile picture). “I hear you and him are best buddies.”\nWell, I’ve never been for a pie and pint with the man. But if Barney’s suggesting I meet with Mr. Gove and other Government ministers to get more money and power for the North East, then yup. That’s my job. And talking to ministers – lots of ministers – is what’s got us £4.27 billion from central Government, delivering my manifesto promise to try and bring the whole region together.\nIn fact, my job consists of basically two things. One, getting cash and powers for the region. Two, investing it to make people’s lives better.\nI often let you know about our investments. There’s 135 active projects creating thousands of jobs, reducing climate damage, tackling poverty, helping local business, and getting people better skilled and educated so they can earn more and live a richer life. A Treasury report said it was “remarkable” how effectively we’ve invested – far surpassing expectations.\nThe whole North of Tyne team – me, staff, and our cabinet members from the local authorities – work together on getting money into the region, too. Last year the North East was the number one region in the whole country for job creation from inward investment. Yet you won’t hear that in the national media.\nIn fact, we’ve just secured another £80 million from Whitehall to develop ‘Investment Zones’. Spread over five years, we’ll use the money to improve digital connectivity, start-up and scale-up facilities for local business, to create more well-paid jobs.\nYou might recall that Liz Truss (remember her?) proposed investment zones in September 2022. Along with others, I raised serious concerns about lowering environmental standards and workers’ rights.\nIn the end, Ms. Truss lost. The lettuce won. The headlines moved on. But I kept talking to ministers. The concept of Government intervening to create good jobs is sound. It was the race-to-the-bottom on tax that was the problem – shifting jobs from one place to another.\nI told them we’re the experts on our region. Every week I talk to our businesses, our research institutions, our workforce and trade unions. How can you boost a region without listening to the people who live there? And I now have it in writing that they will co-design the investment zones with us. No loss in workers’ rights or environmental protections.\nPolitical negotiations aren’t like the films or TV. People banging their hands on tables. Then cut to several hours later, where people’s ties are loosened and the table’s covered in empty coffee cups. Then the hero gives some inspirational speech and saves the day.\nActually, that’s not strictly true, I have seen politicians bang their hands on tables, and raise their voices. They just looked petulant, and lost credibility.\nEffective negotiation is about finding the win-win. In politics, between people with very different values and ideologies, that can be hard. All the while keeping very busy people interested enough to keep answering your texts and taking your calls.\nIt’s very easy, and very tempting, to see them as political enemies. To get into arguments about social justice. That way lies deadlock. You’ve got to keep your ego out of it.\nThis is not like an industrial dispute where they need you to return to work. They’ve been quite happy to ignore many regions completely. They can walk away any time they choose. Yet we got to the front of the queue, ahead of Tory areas.\nIf you can speak their language, they’ll listen. I want well paid green jobs with good trade union terms and conditions. But I talk about investment to boost productivity in emerging sectors.\nIf they’re intrigued by a proposition that will create thousands of jobs and boost the Treasury’s coffers, they’ll keep talking.\nAnd if you’ve got a good track record of delivery, they take you seriously. Then, and only then, can you get deals done.\nThing is, you actually have to understand this stuff, or you get rumbled. You can’t have a Mayor that spits the dummy out when negotiations get difficult.\nThe people of the North East elected me to build bridges, not burn them.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_its-christmas-time/content_96.html": "It’s Christmas Time\nDecember 23, 2018\n“It’s Christmas time, and there’s no need to be afraid.” So says the song.\nThis Christmas, like every year, millions in our country will be working. Emergency services, NHS staff, catering and hospitality workers, taxi drivers, people staffing petrol stations, to name just some.\nAnd for many people who work, and many who can’t get reliable work, the money will run out. I think everyone I know has made a donation to a foodbank and toy donations. It’s both heartening that people care, and heart rending that we need to.\nIt’s simply unbelievable that in the 21st century, in one of the richest countries ever to exist, people are working for a living and their kids are still in poverty. There’s something seriously structurally wrong in the way our country works.\nOne of my favourite Xmas songs is Stop the Cavalry by Jona Lewie, whose birth name was, in a Christmas coincidence, John Lewis. Originally written as an anti-war song, it has become a Christmas classic.\nPerhaps it’s near the top of my list because when it was first released I was growing up. US nuclear cruise missiles were being stationed in the UK at Greenham Common, and fear of nuclear war was palpable.\nBut I think it’s mainly because of the lyrics. Two lines stick out.\n“I have had to fight almost every night, down throughout these centuries. That is when I say, oh yes yet again, can you stop the cavalry?”\nFor generations we’ve been led into wars, started by leaders who were not acting in our interest. They sent our brothers and fathers and sons off to war. It’s always the common soldiers who pay the price, and the civilians whose deaths are labelled as collateral damage.\nI’m not a pacifist, but I’m struggling hard to think of a war that couldn’t have been avoided if we took diplomacy and economic pressure more seriously.\nThe other line that touches me even more is, “If I get home, live to tell the tale, I’ll run for all presidencies. If I get elected I’ll stop, I will stop the cavalry.”\nIt’s the simplicity and innocence of the line. At once so improbable and difficult against apolitical establishment, and yet so obvious and direct as a solution. The idea that the ability to bring about change requires only the political will to make change happen.\nNow I find myself running for Mayor. Even if I win, I won’t have power over foreign policy. But if I get elected, I’ll work night and day to stop the poverty.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_manifesto_full-employment/content_59.html": "If everyone has a secure, well-paid job, it would transform our region. Parents will no longer have to raise their kids in poverty. Crime will fall. Health inequalities will close. And with more money in their pockets, we’ll enjoy a more vibrant cultural scene across our great region. Click on the bullet points above for more.\nFull employment used to be a core policy of the Labour movement. There are currently 68,725 people unemployed in the North East, and many more economically inactive. And 25% of all those in employment are in insecure, zero-hours, or temporary work, including bogus self-employment.\nFull employment means a secure, well-paid job for everyone who wants one. That means more job creation, more access to training for workers, and a better transport system so people can access the jobs wherever they live.\nWe must offer everyone the training and support to land these jobs and keep them, regardless of their needs or disadvantage. And these jobs must pay fair wages with trade union standard terms and conditions. Of course not everyone can work, and our benefits system also needs to stop people living in poverty. That needs change in central government.\nThere will inevitably be what economists call frictional unemployment – where people are between jobs for a month or two, or after leaving education. But we can eliminate mismatch unemployment – that’s where there are jobs available, but people’s skills or life circumstances don’t match what employers need. Better transport will help – I know of young people in Blyth who had to turn down jobs in Team Valley because public transport couldn’t get them there.\nAs North of Tyne Mayor I have one major target from Government: create 10,000 jobs over 30 years. So after four years as Mayor, I should have a jobs pipeline of 1,333. The actual number is 5,049 direct, full-time equivalent jobs. Plus another 3,277 safeguarded by careful support through the pandemic. That’s half the 30 year target in just 4 years. If that’s not economic competence, I don’t know what is.\nLast year the North East was the number one region in the country for job creation from inward investment. We beat London and Manchester – but you won’t have heard that in the national press. I’m confident that I can deliver full employment. This is the only way we can eradicate long-term pockets of poverty and deprivation.",

The figure is set by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation: £9 per hour. Crucially, it applies to everyone – the national minimum wage is only £7.70 if you’re under 25, and £4.35 if you’re under 18. After all, shops don’t sell you food or clothes cheaper if you’re under 25. I’m proud to say that the North of Tyne Combined Authority is a Living Wage Employer.\nWe’re developing our Good Work Pledge – a set of pledges that accredit a firm as a model employer. Paying the Real Living Wage, access to mental health support, opportunities for in work progression, trade union recognition, and flexible working. What’s heartening is the support I’m getting from businesses and employers’ organisations like the Chamber of Commerce, CBI and Federation of Small Businesses. These professionals understand that the best way for a firm to succeed – whether public or private – is to look after their people.\nI want to make any company tendering for public sector contracts sign up to the Good Work Pledge. We have to delay the launch, though, because of the General Election. If Labour get in, what’s in our local pledge will become mandatory in national law.\nOn the subject of work, I was invited to speak to adult learners at Newcastle College last week. The lecture theatre was packed.\nWhat matters most in your ideal job, I asked. High rate of pay? Nope – just two hands went up. Short commute to work – a few hands went up. Good food in the canteen? A few laughs, but not important to them. The ability to use your talents creatively? A flurry of hands went into the air. Being valued and respected by your employer? Yep – now we were cooking, not just all the raised hands, but the body language and murmur of agreement.\nIt was a diverse audience – from health and social care learners, people doing foundation courses for degrees, and a large cohort of ESOL learners – English for Speakers of Other Languages. There was a real wealth of talent amongst the ESOL learners – teachers, engineers, film directors, pharmacists.\nI shared my story: I left school at 16, returned to education in my 20’s, eventually completing my engineering degree followed by a career in engineering and software. Becoming Mayor was an unexpected detour – I’m not sure what GCSEs are needed for that career path!\nWhat struck me about the ESOL learners was their empathy. They wanted to care for the homeless, promote sport for people with disabilities, work with people with dementia. For them, work is an opportunity to contribute – not a transaction of self-interest.\nJudging by the number of people wanting selfies, the students enjoyed my talk. Especially the Sudanese learner who said his ambition was to be the next Mayor.\nA surgeon’s assistant, a refugee from the Syrian army, shared his story with me. Rather than kill his fellow citizens in the civil war, he’d deserted. It took him five months to get here, through five countries, and if he returns a military firing squad will shoot him. He’s bright, highly skilled, and compassionate. Yet between arriving in the UK and getting his confirmed refugee status took 15 months. During this time he was forbidden from working and paying tax, or attending an English Language course in college. It’s crazy – the Home Office that brought us the Hostile Environment makes it illegal for asylum seekers to learn English in college! People are forced into the black-economy, undercutting wages & suffering exploitation. Action Foundation, a fantastic Newcastle-based charity, plugs the gap, training over 600 people through their courses. But it’s shameful that we actively stop immigrants from learning English, leaving them struggling to use buses, do their shopping or take kids to the GP.\nAt its best, work is fulfilling and builds a better society.

This includes community led housing and social housing.\nOne example is that we funded the Great Wall of Scotswood in Newcastle which brought a derelict site back into productive use. More than 200 new homes at The Rise. A district heating system to provide low carbon heat and a skills hub to train the builders of the future.\nNew housing schemes can build in the insulation and systems we need but those old, leaky buildings won’t fix themselves.\nExisting housing is responsible for around a third of carbon emissions.

Half of it is not energy efficient enough.\nThere are 140,000 homes that need to be retrofitted. A programme that could create 3,500 local green jobs. That gets housing to net zero. But at a cost of £13 billion. That scale of money needs central government.\nWe’re getting started though. We’ve launched a £2 million green skills programme. Skills bootcamps that give both those in and out of work the training they need for a good green job. These are free, flexible courses of up to 16 weeks.

So let me set the record straight.\nThe North of Tyne devolution deal contains a target from central Government to create 10,000 jobs over 30 years. So by the end of my 5 year term I should have created 1,667 jobs.\nHow have we got on against that target of 1,667?\nAs of March 2024, our pipeline of brand new private sector jobs is 5,377. Only jobs held for over a year are counted.\nOur programmes are safeguarding 3,277 at-risk private sector jobs, by helping companies quickly pivot to new ways of working, creating new revenue streams. Without our investment these firms would have laid workers off.\nThere are a further 2,533 construction jobs. Our strict criteria do not count construction jobs because they are funded differently.\nIn total, 5,073 of these jobs have been report as filled, including 766 construction jobs. The programmes report in arrears, so the data is always between 3 months and 1 year behind the actual number of jobs. Many is the time I’ve visited a factory and spoken to new employees, then back at the office discovered the people I’d just met weren’t showing on the figures yet.\nIf you add the 5,377 new direct jobs, the 3,277 jobs safeguarded, and the 2,533 construction jobs, that totals 11,187.\nMy target was 1,667. I’ve never used the 11,187 figure, just the 5,377 figure.\nEven by that count, under my leadership the North of Tyne has achieved 323% of target.\nWhen I took office in May 2019, we had created zero jobs. None. The claim the other candidate made that there were 1,000 jobs already is a complete fabrication, and sailing very close to breaking electoral law.\nThe criteria are very strict. To count in our report to Treasury, each job must be full time equivalent, and held by a real person for at least a year, and the direct result of our investment. We don’t include our staff, jobs created in the supply chain, or anything that is not a result of our direct financial investment.\nI’m proud of our record of job creation. It’s a remarkable achievement in partnership with businesses large and small, and my team of hardworking staff at the Combined Authority. We’ve set up programmes supporting local firms. Attracting inward investment. Sector programmes to boost jobs in renewable energy, digital and creative sectors.\nAnd I’ve charged £0 in council tax precept and incurred £0 debt.",

The North East has a natural advantage with some of the best sites for offshore wind nearby. Blyth has a world-class facility which tests wind turbine blades. Wind already accounts for a quarter of the UK’s electricity generation and there is the potential for it to generate even more.\nIn the North of Tyne we’re investing £25 million in offshore wind – a significant 15% of our budget.\nThe Technology, Innovation & Green Growth for Offshore Renewables (TIGGOR) programme is a £3.5m fund designed to boost supply chain growth and productivity in the North of Tyne and the wider North East England region’s offshore wind and subsea sectors.\nOne such company, Transmission Dynamics based in Cramlington, is manufacturing “smart bolts” which can remotely detect when something is about to break and alert an engineer before it does, reducing the need for expensive on sight inspection and maintenance.\nWe’ve invested in Battleship Wharf in Blyth and the Swan Hunter shipyard site for offshore wind.\nAnd we’re supporting renewable energy projects through our Green New Deal Fund. Businesses and community organisations can apply for funding to install solar panels, air source heat pumps, and other ideas that will reduce carbon emissions.\nInvesting right across the industry is critical to ensure that the green jobs of the future are here as we transition away from fossil fuels and address the climate crisis.\nCommunity energy was another key recommendation from the Assembly . In early 2022, NTCA commissioned a report by the Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE) on ‘Enabling Community Energy in the North East of England: Tackling the Climate Emergency’. This provides a series of recommendations for overcoming barriers, along with a potential plan for supporting community energy in the region which will help inform the approach and actions taken by NTCA, the North East LEP, LAs, community groups and regional stakeholders. We are now working with partners to develop further support for community energy projects which is being led regionally by the North East and Yorkshire Energy Hub and several organisations in Northumberland have already benefitted from Rural Community Energy Funding.",

There’s a dependency on grants from Westminster, often tied in with the electoral cycle. Restrictions come from Whitehall on to how to spend it, with priorities optimised for the Home Counties.\nOliver needed the handouts because the playing field was tilted against him. His poor start gave him no chance of prospering. Eventually, he runs away to seek his fortune – in London.\nThe North East’s industrial base had grown organically over two centuries. Jobs and hard work gave us the belief that our kids would be better off than we were. Then in a decade we saw the closure of shipyards, steel plants, wagon works and pits. Government decided the profits from the City finance firms could replace manufacturing.\nThe North East still has a manufacturing base. Nissan is the most productive car plant in Europe. Our problem isn’t anything to do with work ethic. Like poor Oliver, our problem is that we’ve not had the investment we need. We can’t close the gap from local taxation. Our business rates tax base is £300 per person. In London, it’s £940. But there are alternatives to local tax.\nA few months ago, our work with Verisure brought a thousand jobs to the North of Tyne. I’ve just signed off on bringing another firm here, with hundreds more jobs. There’s more in the pipeline. We’re doing the best we can with the tools available. But we need better tools. We need Fiscal Devolution – power over how we raise and spend money.\nFirst, Invest To Save. Our taxes already pay for the effects of obesity, mental ill health, poor air quality and crime. All the evidence confirms that better housing, youth services, transport and careers support save a fortune in the long run. But there’s no mechanism to fund them, except “Please sir, I want some more.”\nIf government allows us to reinvest the savings we make, we can create jobs, improve productivity, and quality of life.\nSecond, Regional Wealth Investment. There are hundreds of sound business propositions in the North of Tyne that would create jobs and pay taxes. But they stall because there isn’t the investment. One business leader told me last week, “All the investment capital goes to the capital.” Why invest in a start-up company in Tyneside when you can invest in property speculation in London?\nLet Combined Authorities step in and fix this. Allow us to get firms off the ground. Every investment creates jobs, raises tax, and ties into our industrial strategy. Real interest rates are negative. Allow us to borrow at the same rate as central government for a regional wealth fund. Recyclable loans and taking equity shares makes it self-funding.\nThird, Land Value Uplift. Public investment in Metro extensions and SuperBus routes increase land value. With the power to capture a share of the increase, we could fund the investments now.\nNone of this means more taxes for citizens – it’s self-funding.\nShy bairns get nowt. I’ve been lobbying hard for more powers. If it wasn’t for the new Zoom world we live in, I wouldn’t have seen my family for the past few weeks. I’d never have been off the train to London. I’ve spoken to ministers, Secretaries of State, the Chancellor and the PM.\nCredit where credit’s due. I’m deeply critical of the government on many issues, but on devolution, they’re playing ball. Whenever I can work cross-party to get a better deal for the people of the North East, I do.\nThe UK is one of the most centralised countries in the world. Of the £143 billion tax raised in the North, ninety five per cent gets transferred to Westminster. Later this year, government will publish the Devolution White Paper. Let’s hope they devolve the tools we need to make our regional economy work for us.\nWe have to get beyond Oliver Twist.\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 29.6.20",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_in-the-name-of-god-go/content_302.html": "“In the name of God, go”\nJanuary 23, 2022\n“In the name of God, go!”\nI had intended to write about the Levelling Up White Paper. It was promised within a year of the 2019 election. But like Godot, we’re still waiting for it.\nIt’s the second time I’ve agreed with David Davis. In November he broke the Conservative whip, voting to require water companies to “take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows”. Is there a better metaphor for Johnson’s premiership than pumping raw sewage into our country? 403,171 times in 2020, according to the Environment Agency.\nDavis’s late intervention at PMQs this week floored the Prime Minister. “You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.”\nJohnson was visibly rattled. “I don’t know what quotation he is alluding to”. Odd, coming from a man who makes £thousands in royalties every month from a book about Churchill. It is reported, and not denied, that they are largely ghost-written.\nFor his much-trailed Shakespeare biography, he offered to pay an academic to research and answer questions Johnson would ask. For this, it’s said Johnson got a £500,000 advance.\nI checked the register of members’ interests. On 30th November 2015, it records £88,000 for “a book as yet unwritten”, plus another £9981 for the paperback. Perhaps he never drew down the remaining £410,000. Perhaps he thinks it’s “chicken feed” like his £22,917 a month fee from the Telegraph. That’s £2,292 an hour for writing his column. £2,292 an hour more than I get for writing my weekly column…\nThat same month he declared £274,796 in media earnings. Of course, he’ll have needed that, scraping by on his MP’s salary of (then) £67,000. Despite simultaneously claiming his £142,000 Mayor of London salary. Plus the occasional £94,507.85, two hour speech in New York, or £122,899.70 three hour speech in India. No wonder he’s had the begging bowl out since he became PM. That gold wallpaper doesn’t buy itself.\nRemember when Johnson missed 5 consecutive COBRA meetings, dismissing Covid as “swine flu”? Dominic Cummings claims Johnson was at the 115-room Kent mansion, Chevening House.\n“Dom,” he’s reported to have said to Cummings (Iago) “I want to run something by you. Do you think it’s ok if I spend a lot of time writing my Shakespeare book? This f***ing divorce, very expensive.”\nThe blurb says Johnson’s book, Riddle of Genius, explores “endlessly intriguing themes of the plays… illicit sex and the power struggles; the fratricide and matricide; … the racism, jealousy, political corruption.” He’s been busy doing first hand research.\nRemember that scene in Macbeth, Act 2, where Macbeth murders King Duncan? Has blood all over his hands, kills Duncan’s guards, and blames them. “Wherefore did you so?” asks Macduff. And Macbeth says those immortal words, “We’ll have to wait for Sue Gray’s inquiry.”\n“Something is rotten in the state of Denmark” says Marcellus, a minor character in Hamlet. He knows that fish rot from the head.\nJohnson has drawn British politics to a place where blackmail is openly discussed. The only levelling up we’ve seen is £4.2 billion used for pork-barrel politics. Sprinkled across the country, disproportionately to marginal Tory seats. Nothing to address inequality, crumbling infrastructure or decades of underinvestment.\nJohnson has even lost his Wragg. Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Conservative MP William Wragg, claims MPs have been bribed and blackmailed over funding for their constituencies. A dozen other Tories have come forward.\nAlthough individually, Conservative MPs can display moments of integrity, they’ve all gone along with him. Defended him. Enabled him.\nDavid Davis voted with Johnson and the whip to cover up Owen Paterson’s corruption. Between them, they’ve voted to deny poor children free schools meals, the £20 universal credit cut plunging millions into poverty, and putting National Insurance increases on the lowest paid.\nJohnson has been venal. Morally and politically corrupt. And for what? What big project? He’s more indecisive than Hamlet. He has only one passion, to advance Boris Johnson.\nLying awake, unable to sleep, I wonder if Johnson recalls Macbeth. And reflects his own political career. “A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”.\n*Originally published in the Journal and Chronicle 24.01.22",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_is-criminal-behaviour-a-symptom-of-a-complex-societal-sickness/content_269.html": "Is Criminal Behaviour A Symptom Of A Complex Societal Sickness?\nApril 16, 2023\nFrom Stephen Lawrence and Hillsborough, to Wayne Couzens and David Carrick – trust in the police is at an all-time low, especially among women and ethnic minority communities. Scandal after scandal is being uncovered\nI’ve seen firsthand many professional, dedicated, and caring officers and support staff. They work hard to uphold justice and keep people safe. I feel for them – they must feel betrayed when those in power allow a toxic culture to fester. It makes their already difficult job harder.\nThe public instinctively understand there can be a bad apple in any organisation. What’s unacceptable is a cover-up culture. The perception of police closing ranks instead of opening themselves up to public scrutiny.\nWe all know places where crime is endemic. Where law abiding people have neighbours on the edge of the law. With persistent anti-social behaviour. Who can they turn to if they don’t trust the police?\n“In effect, what we are witnessing is the decriminalisation of rape,” said former Northumbria Police & Crime Commissioner Dame Vera Baird. The conviction rate stands at less than 1%. Less than 1%. Traumatised by the assault, survivors are then re-traumatised when the criminal justice system fails them. Why hasn’t this been addressed?\nI’ve been aware of domestic violence since I was young. My Mam was the first Chair of the Middlesbrough Refuge from Domestic Violence. Back then it was informally called the Battered Wives Home – the language has changed since then. The problem, sadly, has not.\nI remember playing with kids who were in the refuge with their mothers. One time an ex-partner tracked down the address and forced his way in. A brave member of staff tried to protect her, and was punched in the face by the violent man. She needed hospital treatment and carried a permanent facial injury affecting her sight. I can feel the anger rising as type this, now, over forty years later. Lord alone knows how it must feel to survivors. Or those trapped in a gaslighting relationship. And minority ethnic, or trans, victims of domestic abuse suffer a whole other layer of conscious and unconscious bias.\nThat’s why allies are so important. I always wear the White Ribbon on my suit, and the North of Tyne is a White Ribbon organisation. It’s the campaign for men to stand up against men who create a culture of misogyny. And I’m proud to say my two teenage sons are supporters too.\nCriminal behaviour is a complex problem, a symptom of wider societal sickness. Residents flag up anti-social behaviour to me all the time, and ask for more community policing. That’s not the role of the Mayor, nor will it be after we come together in the new North East devolution deal in May 2024.\nMy position, as North of Tyne Mayor, will be replaced by the North East Mayor – essentially the same job over a larger area. But our two existing police and crime commissioners will still exist. The new Mayor will not take on those powers. Northumbria and Durham will remain as separate police constabularies.\nResearch shows that if everyone has a secure, well-paid job, crime would halve overnight. The 4,803 new jobs in the North of Tyne will help reduce crime.\nHelping the 650 kids who’ve been excluded from school get a decent education will change their futures, which is why we’re working on it.\nThe widely praised North of Tyne Child Poverty Prevention programme takes pressure of families, and will directly help 1,600 kids by this July.\nOur skills bootcamps give ex-offenders free vocational training and a guaranteed job interview, and fresh start in life.\nAnd NU Futures – the superb new youth centre we funded near St James Park – runs extensive community outreach programmes targeting thousands of young people across the North of Tyne. In its first year over 500 young women and girls got opportunities to access career pathways and bright futures in football.\nOne of the reasons I worked so hard to land the new North East devolution deal was so we can roll out great programmes like these south of the Tyne, into Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland and County Durham. A share of that £4.3 billion will change lives.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_paul-mason-where-next-after-corbynism-a-reply/content_94.html": "Paul Mason – Where Next After Corbynism: A Reply\nDecember 19, 2019\nIn the final paragraph of Paul Mason’s thesis he name checks me, saying we need to be “learning from Jamie Driscoll’s mayoral campaign on North Tyneside.” Thanks for the nod, Paul.\nWhat did we do to warrant this reference?\nIn one sense, we didn’t do anything special. We just did lots of simple things right.\nI’m the Labour Mayor for the North of Tyne. That’s a city region metro Mayor, the same as Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Steve Rotherham in Liverpool City Region, Dan Jarvis in Sheffield, and Sadiq Khan in London. London has way more money and powers, though.\nThis was the first ever election for North of Tyne Mayor.\nContext:\nMay 2019’s local elections were a disaster for Labour in the North East.\nOutside of the North of Tyne Labour lost control of Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland, Darlington, and in total, and lost 57 of the 171 seats we defended. That’s exactly 1 in 3 seats lost.\nThe directly elected Mayor for Middlesbrough council, which had been Labour, saw our vote collapse from 16,680 to 6,692 and lose by a landslide to an independent.\nIn the North of Tyne, there were locals elections in Newcastle and North Tyneside councils, where we lost 3 of 37 seats, or 8%. The council elections were run by the local Labour teams with support from the regional office.\nMy campaign was run independently from the locals, since it spanned 3 local authority areas, including the vast county of Northumberland, three times the area of Greater London. But my social media, press, radio and TV would have reached the same people, as would my leaflets, direct mails, and canvassing.\nThere were no local elections in Northumberland, but two by-elections, one caused by the sudden death of Bernard Pidcock; friend, Labour legend, and father of Laura Pidcock. Labour candidates were returned with an increased majority. Correlation does not prove causation, but they were under the umbrella of my social media and press campaigns.\nWe had a 33% turnout. Pretty good for a Mayoral election. Compare that with 21% for Tees Valley. 29% for Manchester, 26% Liverpool, 26% Sheffield City Regions.\nWhat people thought was going to be a close election was a comfortable victory, bucking the regional trend.\nWhat did we do right?\n1. We had an open primary. There was an open selection for Labour candidates. I was persuaded to stand by my comrades very late before the deadline. In a process from November 2018 to Feb 2019 (far too long) I went up against Nick Forbes, Newcastle Council Leader, Leader of the LGA, and NEC member. I won comfortably, but it meant there was massive awareness of the election, and of me, before I took on the real opposition. There was also significant press and broadcast interest in who would win the nomination. We were campaigning for six months solid.\nNow, I can’t take credit for the process, but it engages members, and builds momentum. Labour should embrace full open selection in all seats. Get rid of this half-arsed trigger ballot system. All it does is encourage people to pack meetings, rather than debate ideas and rehearse their campaigns. Make all MPs engage their members, not just the enlightened ones – they’ll need them in 2024!\nBuilding the Team. How we use our mass membership.\n2. I had a massive team. Even during the internal selection, we regularly had 30 people turn up to phone bank for me. I’d been a leading grassroots activist. People knew me, trusted me, and my victory was their victory.\n3. It was member led. I declined the offer of the Labour North staff to run the campaign, and asked my team who won the internal selection to run it. That boosted the confidence and ownership of the members. The amount of talent and energy that people put into it was huge. I asked the professional staff to do the specialist legal work: registrations, expenses returns, etc – keeping me out of jail 🙂 And media support.\n4. We had a simple sign-off process. Tasks were divvied up, and clear strategies were agreed. After that, I let the skilled volunteers use their initiative, and I trusted them. I said at the start: if I’ve authorised you to do something, do it. If you make a mistake, I will own it. With freedom to act, their energy and creativity shone through. My job was to be up front, scoring the goals, not tracking back to defence.\n5. Engage the team. We had a volunteer whose job it was to liaise with new volunteers. People were welcomed with conversation, not just given a place and a time and pile of leaflets. They came to the pub with us. It’s so simple, but it’s so often missed. We had a massive WhatApp group. I and the key organisers would post updates in, so all the members were in the loop and felt part of the team. We assigned a volunteer to sit down with the less tech savvy and show them how to use WhatsApp.\n6. One person, one job. Apart from a handful of key organisers, volunteers were asked to do one thing, and do it well. And if they had more time, to do more of it. Whether social media, leafleting, fundraising, whatever. Focus raises confidence, productivity, and morale.\n7. Inform the members. Every week I’d record a 2 minute video explaining a key policy, and email it to the thousands of party members in the North of Tyne. They heard me explaining my policies in doorstep terms. Feedback was great – people knew what to say to their mates & their neighbours when questions were asked.\n8. I looked after my team. Good candidates do this, but it’s amazing how many campaigns I’ve been part of that don’t. An army marches on its stomach. Make sure there’s food and drink. Take your team out afterwards for a beer. Always have a celebration party – or a wake. The Labour staff got personalised gifts.\nWe went one further, and asked a mental health professional who was part of the team to keep an eye on people and watch for signs of burnout.\nA Clear Message.\n9. We wrote a bold manifesto. In plain English. Some policies are seriously ambitious – setting up a Bank owned co-operatively by the people. Building community housing that’s not subject to right-to-buy. The manifesto had a clear narrative: keep our money in our region. The policies were clear, simple and concrete, not vague aspirations.\n10. Our messaging was tight. Although there are 82 individual promises in the manifesto, we condensed them into 5 key polices, and repeated them over and over. The number of polices was 5. We kept repeating them. We repeated the five policies over and over. Did I mention….? Within weeks, the media was repeating my policies. Better still, the opposition was attacking them. Sweet.\nA Strong Candidate.\n11. Not me, but my public persona. We’ve all got complex back stories. Any candidate worth their salt should have a history of good works. It’s how you condense these into a short, identifiable persona that counts. I have run philosophy and economics reading groups, have written literary fiction, run marathons to raise money for Amnesty, and am a black belt in jiu jitsu. I care deeply about poverty and the environment, and grow fruit in my back garden. That’s all good stuff. We didn’t use it. It’s scattergun. In the campaign, I left school at 16, worked in engineering, went to university as a mature student, became a project engineer, then later set up my own business. I’m married, my wife is a GP, and I have two brilliant young sons. We live in Gosforth. That’s tight. People understand it. They can place me. It leaves no gaps. The polices and voice tell them my character.\n12. I owned my politics. Early on, the opposition said I was a Corbyn supporter. I was a Momentum activist. I was a radical socialist. I said yes I am. I’m proud to want an economy that works for the many, not the few. Who would respect someone who disowns their own team? They stop chasing you when you stop running.\n13. We made a high quality video. And pushed it with paid ads. People are far more likely to vote for you if they’ve seen you.\n14. I did my homework. I researched the Mayoral role, the powers, the issues, the lot. I was up against a millionaire Tory businessman, and an independent who owns a PR company and used to chair the Chamber of Commerce. Plus a Lib Dem and a Kipper. At a massive business hustings, with media there, it should have been a home game for my opponents. I answered the questions honestly. I like trade unions because they reduce staff turnover and unionised workplaces are more productive. Yes, I did think councils should take services back in house, it’s cheaper and service levels are higher. I could answer any question with informed knowledge. The Tory couldn’t command the detail, and floundered. After the debate, business people came up to me and said, “I’ve never voted Labour before, but I’ll vote for you. You know what you’re talking about.” Some even donated to my campaign. A section of voters aren’t interested in policy, they’re interested in competence.\nA Strong Voice.\n15. We kept it relentlessly positive. Plenty of people were happy to have a pop at the opposition, we didn’t need to. Every time a Facebook post called me communist, we replied: which policies don’t you like? Every time we got a “you’re all on the gravy train” we replied “Jamie claimed £0 in expenses as a councillor.” It might not have persuaded the trolls, but it did persuade the watchers.\n16. We responded with class to the personal attacks. When the opposition got personal and nasty – which they did – or fabricated lies, we responded with “I’m sorry to see you stoop to this level. I think the people deserve a Mayor who doesn’t engage in playground name calling” We didn’t get in the gutter, but we did respond. No one gets a free shot at you. This earned a *lot* of respect.\n17. We did not preach on social media, we engaged. We didn’t tell people why they should vote for me. We told them what difference it would make. The threads were full of conversation. When people made negative, but not abusive, comments, we asked them why they thought a policy wouldn’t work, and discussed it.\n18. Our print was authentic. It was written in natural English, in short sentences, without buzzwords. And at no point did I “care about the people” or was “passionate about our region”. I just told people what I would do if elected. And our print was really well designed – visually appealing.\n19. Our website was crisp, modern, and easy to use. It had sign-up forms and donation buttons. I was lucky enough to have a terrifically skilled volunteer to build it. But luck is the residue of design. Build a good team, and you’ll find good people.\n20. We held events. A massive Green New Deal event when Labour was still coming round to the policy. It engaged the Greens, Extinction Rebellion, and school climate strikers – who I’d previously supported. We ran manifesto consultation events – local community groups got involved this way.\n21. We engaged all communities. I spoke to people at the Mosques, with my history as an active anti-fascist activist with a strong history of case work. We engaged businesses with socialist policies about community wealth building and procurement. We engaged community forums, food banks, arts centres. We did a video with a signer for the deaf community. We went right up to Berwick with a large team and knocked whole estates.\n22. And we did authentic media about it. Simple, selfie videos in one take about what I was doing, long before Rory the Tory got credit for the idea during the Tory leadership election. I reckon he nicked the idea from me 🙂\n23. I took any debate. Environment hustings. Hustings in rural areas. I attended at least three different business hustings. Later, I had my home game. Citizens UK had a 1500 people event, including hundreds from the local mosque. My years of activism meant I knew the organisers & many of the audience. They were asking us to respond to questions on the Real Living Wage, Hate Crime charters, and the mental health crisis. Tory boy bottled it by this stage and didn’t turn up. The press reported his absence.\nWhat Else?\n24. We crowdfunded. The Tories massively outspent us, putting nearly £200k in. Their candidate was born into a family fortune and couldn’t remember how many millions he had. They ran full page ads in the regional press. Loads of paid mail. We were short of dosh. Before I stood to be Labour candidate, some people thought the Progress candidate was a shoo in. One Labour Group had £5000 allocated to the Mayoral campaign. When I won, that suddenly dropped to £500. So we crowdfunded. And Unite kindly donated £10k.\n25. I built alliances. The Green Party didn’t run against me. In part because of the £5k deposit. In part because I know many of them through the climate change movement. Lots of Extinction Rebellion, and a number of Green Party members campaigned for me.\n26. We went for number of votes, not marginals. We campaigned in areas Labour neglects in council elections. We leafleted low turnout, previously safe Labour wards. We knocked seats where Labour never wins, but where turnout is high. And we knocked every door, not just Labour promises. I turned a lot of Tories in rural Northumberland on the issue of houses being too expensive for their kids to live where they grew up.\nIs this a magic recipe for victory in a 2024 general election?\nNo. Our campaign was far from perfect. It was rushed, we pulled together a team hurriedly, and there were a lot of people learning as we went, including me. I’ve sharpened up my media performance enormously.\nI’d only fought one election as a candidate, for the new city centre ward of Monument. (Where we won with an absolute majority over all the other parties, despite it having a mix of deprived, student, and very affluent neighbourhoods.) With five years to plan for the next Mayoral election, and the incumbency factor, we will run a far stronger campaign next time.\nI’ve been so busy setting up the Combined Authority I haven’t kept my campaign or social media up to date, and am just getting back to it now the General Election is finished. Which leads to:\n27. Select candidates early. We couldn’t, so we were rushed and heavily dependent on the fact that I had a strong following before we began. That’s a rare advantage, most new candidates have to build their teams from scratch. Let’s get all Parliamentary candidates openly selected by 2022 ready for 2024.\nWhat have we done so far?\nI’ve been in office for around seven months. It’s a brand new authority, and the first months were mostly recruiting staff. By the time you’ve specified the job, advertised, interviewed, and people work their notice, months have passed. I didn’t get my chief of staff until August, and my political advisor until September. My two permanent directors only joined my team at the start of December. My comms team is still only half full. My climate change specialist doesn’t start until February 2020.\nNevertheless, in that time, we have:\n- Set up tailored rural, urban, and innovation programmes to support small business growth creating 522 jobs.\n- Set up an inward investment programme that was originally to bring 600 new jobs. It’s already been so successful we’ve expanded it to bring in 2000 jobs. I’ve been directly involved in talking to employers to set up businesses here, and they’re good jobs – permanent, full time, with decent t&cs. I won’t be supporting any Sports Direct or Amazon warehouses.\n- Launched a Climate Change teacher programme, partnering with the United Nations programme to get teachers accredited as climate change specialists as part of their continuing professional development.\n- Become a Real Living Wage employer with a zero gender pay gap.\n- Implemented programmes with kids to engage them in STEM subjects – including a mobile planetarium from Kielder Observatory that visits schools, and a programme at the Mining Museum to get kids engaged in industrial history.\n- Set up a Returnships Programme to support people who’ve been out of work caring for loved ones to get the support, confidence and training they need to find their back to work.\n- A Working Homes programme that works with people in social housing to give them skills, support and confidence to get into paid employment, and find them jobs. This is totally independent of the DWP and non-coercive.\n- Funded a sports & youth centre leveraging the brand of Newcastle United, but independent of the club, to engage youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. With an extensive outreach programme to left behind areas. This is now signed off, but building work hasn’t started yet.\n- Leveraged in millions from private firms and other funding sources, tripling our own budget.\n- A small, but important manifesto promise: rather than have a Jaguar and a driver, I share a North East built Nissan Leaf electric pool car with my staff.\n- And just this week, my cabinet has agreed our Good Work Pledge – an employment charter. To get accreditation, an employer must meet a number of criteria, including: paying the Real Living Wage, offering stable hours, in work progression, meeting diversity and equality standards, giving mental health support and flexible working. Plus – have a trade union recognition agreement. I’ll repeat that last one – employers will need a trade union recognition agreement. This will be a cornerstone of our Community Wealth Building programme. Using social value clauses, employers wanting public sector contracts will need accreditation to qualify for social value. I’ve got buy in from the business organisations, LEP members, and major employers.\nThe above is what we’ve done, and doesn’t include what we’re going to do. What’s in the pipeline for the future is even more exciting.\nSo Paul Mason is right. Our Party’s campaigning methods are too often stuck in the 20th century. There are good local campaigning initiatives, but they need to be supported and funded. Far too many of our campaigns are centralised command and control. Empower the members to win for us. Networks beat hierarchies every time.\nIf you want to read more about communication techniques, social psychology and left politics, you can buy my book: Way of the Activist",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_why-our-economy-is-broken/content_62.html": "Why Our Economy is Broken\nJanuary 3, 2019\nWhen I grew up in the 1970s, photocopiers were so advanced that my school didn’t have one. When I started work in 1986 the company I worked for didn’t have a computer, we had people whose only job was to type up things the rest of us had written with a pen and carbon paper.\nTechnology is massively more efficient now. We can communicate instantly, we can copy & paste documents. We have checkouts where customers scan their own food and stock control and ordering is automated. Machines do half our work for us. So why aren’t we better off?\nIn the 1970’s, young families could afford a house on one skilled wage. We had almost no debt. As a country we could afford to fund park keepers and careers services and youth and community workers. Nobody went to a food bank, because nobody needed to.\nSo why, since we’re so much more productive than forty years ago, can we afford so much less? The answer is neoliberalism. Our entire economy and political system has been restructured to serve private financial companies.\nThrough the 1950’s and 60’s banking was seen as a dull but worthy occupation. Financial companies earned a return of around 5%, compared with industry which earned around 15%. Since the rise of neoliberalism those rates of return have reversed. Financial speculation pays much better than producing real wealth.\nIt started with the Thatcher-Regan shift, continued under Tony Blair’s New Labour and the Clinton era Democrats. New Labour channelled taxes into better public services, but Peter Mandelson was “intensely relaxed about people becoming filthy rich.” Only when Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership did any major party challenge this.\nThe basic objective of capitalism is to accumulate capital – money – for the sake of it. Anything useful – like goods and services – are a side effect.\nThroughout the industrial era, capitalists accumulated capital by making things. Economists from Adam Smith in 1776, Karl Marx in the 1800’s and John Maynard Keynes in the 1920’s and 30’s knew this. The industrial model of capitalism was to get rich by employing people. A wealthy entrepreneur would start with a big chunk of cash, and pay people to mine coal or build cars. He’d keep the profits of the workers’ labour for himself and the wealthy shareholders.\nDespite the exploitation and brutal working conditions, there was a love-hate relationship between the workers and the owners. To become rich, the owners needed to employ lots of increasingly skilled workers. The introduction of free state education served the interests of the poor and the rich alike.\nThe 1945 Labour government shifted power in favour of working people. Major industries were nationalised: rail, coal, the docks. Even the NHS was a boon to industrial capitalism: healthier workers boosted productivity. Throughout the post-war period there was a direct link between rising productivity and rising wages. We saw record rises in prosperity.\nThat form of capitalism was fatally wounded in the 1970s, and replaced by neoliberal capitalism. An ideology got hold of the political elite: make money by manipulating the financial system. Laws and financial regulations were changed. The basic idea of capitalism is unchanged: it’s still about accumulating capital. But the mode of doing it changed. Asset stripping became a legitimate business model. There was an explosion in derivates and complex financial instruments.\nAbove all, we’ve seen an economic take over by the rent-seekers. Rent-seeking capitalism is where we are charged for using something owned by someone else. In most cases the owners don’t do any useful work. They charge us because they’re rich enough to own it, and we have no choice.\nHousing rent is the easiest to see: someone with enough money buys a house, then rents it to someone who can’t afford to buy one, keeping a tidy profit. Rent seeking is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich.\nIt’s everywhere now. Take a water company. We built it, with public funds, and the Tories sold it. Then the owners charge us for clean water, make huge profits and paying little or no tax.\nIt’s the same with NHS services. We pay for it with our income tax, National Insurance and VAT, and holding companies bid for contracts, employ NHS trained workers, and cream off profits. Healthy workers were useful to industrial capitalists. Neoliberal capitalists would prefer people with chronic conditions, so they can sell us expensive drugs year after year, and profit from the intellectual property.\nThe biggest rent-seeking activity is banking. If you’re in a strong enough financial position to buy a house, chances are you’ll need a mortgage. Even at today’s record low interest rates, for every £1 you borrow, you’ll pay back £1.60. You might own your home, but the bank is still charging you rent on the money to buy it.\nThe most basic contradiction of capitalism is that the money has to come from somewhere. In the industrial age, rising wages meant people could afford to buy things.\nSince the 1970’s wages have frozen, in real terms. Now the extra money for profits has come by getting us all into debt. All those rising house prices in the 1990’s and 2000’s were just a way to secure the ever rising debt, so the mega-rich had a source of funds for their profits. It crashed in 2007.\nThe response? Quantitative Easing. Create loads of funds at the stroke of a keyboard to prop up the financial system. In the UK alone we’ve created £435 billion of cash. 93% of it, according to the Bank of England, has gone straight to boosting the profits of the financial sector. Personal debt has again risen higher than before the 2007 crash.\nNormal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for – in order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car, and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it.\nElle Goodman\nWe desperately need to get rid of austerity, and fund public services properly. But that’s not enough. We’ve had austerity since the 2010 coalition government. But since Thatcher onwards we saw a relentless rise in rent seeking.\nEven through the New Labour years the gap grew between the richest and the poorest, and personal debt increased. Poverty was addressed by government spending on things like tax credits. Essentially, we were subsidising low wages so corporations could make a profit from underpaid workers. As soon as the Tories brought in Universal Credit and the abhorrent sanctions regime, people had to go to foodbanks, even if they were working. What we need to do is pay proper wages in the first place.\nCentrists just can’t see this. They cannot see that structural inequality is the direct result of a system where you become richer by starting rich. They think that a compromise can be reached between global capital and social justice. Their belief is that if we can just manage the state a bit better, if we can just tweak the existing institutions, we can go back to a fully funded NHS and Sure Start. It’s a pipe dream. John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn know this. They know we have to radically restructure our economy to work in the interests of the many and not the few.\nIt’s also the reason why Jeremy is being attacked by all the defenders of the status quo: they know the Corbyn Project is about an irreversible shift in power and wealth.\nThis shift can’t be done from Parliament alone. It will take a network of local community wealth builders, a rise in worker owned firms, and an increase in new models of home ownership. Above all it will require us to have banks owned by the people. Labour has a headline policy of a National Investment Bank. To complete the shift away from neoliberal capitalism, we also need regional cooperative banks.\nA lot of people have asked me why I want to stand as Mayor. It’s certainly not because I have ambitions to be a career politician. It’s because neoliberalism will eat up our communities, our children’s futures, and burn our planet unless we stop it.\nIf I’m elected I’ll set up a People’s Bank. I’ll use Community Wealth Building to increases wages across the whole local economy. I’ll set up worker owned firms, including a green energy supplier. And I’ll create new models of housing that cannot be privatised.\nIf you want to join the campaign, and build a socialist future, register here: https://www.jd4mayor.com/contact/",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_how-can-one-tree-mean-so-much/content_189.html": "How can one tree mean so much?\nOctober 1, 2023\nHow can one tree mean so much?\nThe felled tree at Sycamore Gap has been front page news and top story on news bulletins. I’ve had more media enquiries about this than about anything else in the North of Tyne. BBC, ITV, Sky News, local and national press. Even the New York Times rang me for a reaction.\nI made one short Tweet about it on Thursday, from the site. The sawdust was still on the ground. The police tape marking it out as a crime scene. The majestic tree fallen, across The Wall, stump raw and exposed.\n“I can’t express how angry I am at the vandalism of the tree at #SycamoreGap. People have had their ashes scattered there. People have proposed there. I’ve picnicked there with my wife and kids. It’s part of our collective soul. We must bring whoever did this to justice.”\nThat one Tweet could receive thousands of comments and millions of views shows the depth of feeling this destructive act has evoked. People have shared their stories, their grief, and even written poems.\nSome comments ask if it can regrow. The answer is yes, shoots will erupt. But it will not regrow to the same size or shape. Some suggest planting new trees nearby. But part of its significance is its location on Hadrian’s Wall, a world heritage site. Some suggest using the fallen timber to make a sculpture.\nOthers suggest leaving nature to take its course.\nBy cruel twist of irony, on Friday morning when news of the destruction came through, I was in nearby Hexham, talking about the need to plant more trees for timber. There’s a shortage of forest cover in England. There’s a difference between ancient woodland that boosts biodiversity, and timber forests, of course. But both lock carbon away from the atmosphere.\nFor some, the loss of the Sycamore was symbolic of the damage facing our natural world.\n“The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time to plant a tree is now,” a forester told me earlier this summer. At the North of Tyne we’ve planted broadleaf and mixed forests in Northumberland to offset our remaining emissions and boost biodiveristy. Even 20 years won’t replace this tree.\nBut this is not just about the natural world. People’s anger is directed at a very human source. Sycamore Gap is in a remote location. It took a very heavy chainsaw and a very skilled hand to fell that tree.\nThe police investigation is ongoing. I’m not going to speculate on who or how many people perpetrated this crime, or their motives.\nTo those who say “it’s just a tree” I would ask, is the Mona Lisa just a painting? Is Big Ben just another bell in a clock tower? Are your wedding photographs just ink on a page?\nWe have a word for times like this: desecration.\nI’m not a religious man, but outstanding natural beauty speaks to our presence as part of the living Earth. This tree, centuries old, connected us to that which is ancient. The intersection with Hadrian’s Wall and a civilisation long gone.\nIt’s no accident that trees are symbolic in religion. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden – the foundational story of the Abrahamic Religions. The sacred Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha found enlightenment. Yggdrasil, the sacred tree of Norse cosmology.\nFew of us today believe trees host an immortal spirit. But most of us felt a spiritual connection with something beautiful and timeless. There long before we were born, and we hoped would live long after we are gone.\nI know the tree is not human. Or even animal. I know that many of us have lost loved ones to road traffic accidents. To cancer. To war. To crime, even.\nAnd perhaps that explains the impact of this loss better than anything else. Individual loss is lonely, and it’s painful. What we are witnessing here is collective empathy. A shared symbol on which we can all project our emotions. That’s what I mean when I say, “It’s part of our collective soul.”",

Since my election we’ve probably had the most turbulent economic time in the last 100 years. We completed a due diligence on the People’s Bank as soon as I was elected and it was found to be financially viable on a wider North East footprint.\nThrough the pandemic I made the decision to prioritise financial support for businesses.

The big banks based outside the North East do not have a good track record of lending to the full range of businesses based here.\nThe North East has the lowest rate of business start-ups in England.

This Wednesday he invited me along to the Newcastle premiere of his latest film, Sorry We Missed You.\nWithout giving any spoilers, Abby works as a carer, Ricky as a “self employed” delivery driver under unremitting pressure to hit targets, or face fines. Kids Seb and Lisa-Jane are caught in the middle, their parents too busy or too knackered to give them the attention and nurture they need. The tragedy of parents working till they drop, hoping to save enough money to buy their own home and escape the poverty trap of sky-high rents. It rings true.\nI worked with Ken on Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign, showing Spirit of 45, his film about the 1945 Labour government that literally rebuilt Britain from the rubble, created the NHS, built millions of homes, introduced the welfare state and provided a safety net, so no-one would ever have to go back to the crippling poverty of the 1930’s.\nYet in the era of smartphones and Netflix, Britain has 1.6 million people using foodbanks, 14 million people in poverty, 250,000 children in temporary accommodation. Numbers too high to comprehend – so high they make us numb. Ken tells the human stories. Daniel Blake, a hard working joiner who’s suffered a heart attack, forced back to work by a welfare system intent on punishing people instead of helping them. “They’re using hunger as a weapon,” Ken told me, “to force people into insecure work, where they have no power, against the threat of starvation.”\nThe stories are true. United Nations Rapporteur Philip Alston describes a “social calamity” with “people who depend on food banks and charities for their next meal, who are sleeping on friends’ couches because they are homeless and don’t have a safe place for their children to sleep, who have sold sex for money or shelter, children who are growing up in poverty unsure of their future.” By this measure, austerity Britain is a failed state.\nOnce the anger of injustice cools, we’re left asking: what has gone wrong? Amidst all the technology and innovation, in our city, in 2019, kids in school uniform poverty are going to school in slippers, a true case I heard just this weekend.\nOne in four of the North of Tyne workforce earn less than the Real Living Wage – the amount you need to live on without sinking into debt. We’re trying to change that, with the North of Tyne Good Work pledge – where companies sign up to pay decent wages, have fair employment practices, allow trade union recognition, in work progression, flexible working and mental health support for staff. I want to make it so that anyone getting public sector contracts has to provide Good Work. This creates an environment in which real small businesses can thrive.\nOn Thursday, Ken was on Question Time in South Shields. The usual arguments were rehearsed again. We voted Leave (just). We were lied to about what Brexit means. All true, but what matters is the effect on people’s lives.\nKen cut through again – “We have precarious working now, in the EU, and we’ll have it again even worse if Johnson’s the Prime Minister.”\nThat’s what’s been lost in the Leave-Remain argument. The millions of people who’ve been left behind are being left behind again.\nWe need radical change, but Brexit is not the place to look.\nWhen a billion pound property portfolio of London office blocks rises in value, the economic figures look good. But what good are rising property values to people working in the gig economy? Trickle down is a myth – wealth trickles up through interest payments and rent. How about we measure wellbeing instead of GDP? Let’s change our objectives.\nAre our kids happy? Do we have good mental health? Are we living sustainably? Have we ended homelessness?

Its global aftermath caused mass unemployment and eventually a collapse of democracy across Europe, the rise of the Nazis, and genocide.\nThe response to the Wall Street crash in both the US and Britain was to cut public spending. Austerity didn’t work then, and it didn’t work in the 2010’s either. It’s a mistake to think of a country as a person. If one person maintains his income, but spends less, he can reduce his debts. But across a whole country, one person’s spending is another person’s income. Cutting public spending cuts our collective income, along with the foundations of our health and education.\nIn 1932 the American people voted out Herbert Hoover’s austerity policies and elected Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and his New Deal. The US government invested in public works – home building, dam construction, transport infrastructure. They introduced a welfare system to support people. With money in their pockets, people spent more, and commerce recovered.\nPublic works were only half of the New Deal. The US introduced laws to strengthen trade unions. There was an explicit recognition that empowering workers to stand up for their economic interests serves the common good.\nIn 1932-3, the US passed the Glass-Steagall Acts – regulation that stopped excessive speculation by banks. The global financial system was broadly stable the rest of the century. In 1999, under pressure from rich lobbyists, the US Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Acts. In 8 short years we saw the 2007 subprime crisis and the global financial crash. If financial speculators can make more money gambling than investing in productive assets, we all suffer.\nPost-Covid Britain faces two crises: poverty and the climate emergency.\nEven before Covid, life expectancy was falling in parts of the North East. Many families in work are unable to pay the bills. Thousands of our people can’t eat without support from food banks. Under Covid, economic inequality has risen – many are deep in debt, and unemployment is rising. Poverty causes long term scarring to the life chances of our kids.\nIn November, the UK will host COP26, the global climate summit, to review the targets set in Paris in 2016. Even if all countries stick to their agreed targets, we’ll see a global temperature rise of over 3 degrees C. Higher temperatures mean higher humidity.\nWhen you cover a thermometer bulb in wet cloths, and it still reaches 35 degrees C, it means it’s too hot for humans to sweat and cool down, even in the shade. Fans don’t help – the air is too humid. Without air conditioning, people die within hours.\nThis will affect around half the world’s population. India, China, the Mediterranean, and large parts of the US and Latin America. That means it will affect us too: our economy is global. And I don’t want my kids inheriting a world where 3 billion people have been made homeless.\nIt’s time for a Green New Deal. Let’s build a million low-carbon homes. Let’s build a net-zero public transport system, that’s cheap, safe and convenient. Let’s retrofit our buildings to save energy and save money. Let’s create a clean, cheap renewable energy grid. And while we’re on, let’s invest in education and training so people can get these jobs, and in sport, arts and entertainment so we can all enjoy ourselves on our days off.\nAnd in parallel to the Glass-Steagall Acts, we need to outlaw exploitative working conditions and phase out high-carbon technologies. Good employers and responsible firms need to be protected from those who undercut them with poverty wages or polluting business models.\nWe’ve got a plan for this in the North East. It needs £2.8 billion of public investment. It will create 55,000 good jobs. A person on average salary pays over £15,000 a year in tax, once you include national insurance and VAT. So those 55,000 jobs will earn the government £825 million a year. The plan pays for itself in under four years.\nSo that’s the cost of doing it. What’s the cost of not doing it? The more we invest with foresight, the less we will regret in hindsight.\nPublished Originally in The Journal and Evening Chronicle 15.3.21",

Its tax systems, justice, education, health, and so on. But there’s a twist. You don’t know in advance what part you will play in that society. Philosophers call this a Veil of Ignorance. You don’t know your gender, race, age, height. Whether you’ll have a disability.\nYou might be born to loving parents who take you to the park and help you with your homework. Or into a family with a Dad in prison. You might be happily married, or a woman trapped in a violent relationship. Maybe you’ve been a victim of knife crime, and live with the trauma.\nYou don’t know your abilities. You might have a talent for art. You might be academically gifted. You might, like 50% of people, be below average at exams. You might live in a deprived area, where drug pushers target your kids.\nBe honest: would you be confident playing that lottery in modern Britain?\nThe IPPR report, State of the North, was published last week. “The north of England – like the rest of the country – is currently beset by deep and severe divisions,” it says.\nIn the North East alone, 330,000 workers earn less than they need to live on. 89,000 of our people were given emergency food parcels last year. That includes 33,000 children. 167,000 women born in the 1950’s have had their pension rights pilfered. 17,000 kids are taught in oversized classes. 37,000 kids in working families are in poverty. 201,000 people waited more than four hours in A&E. Violent crime has risen by 27%. Knife crime by 92%. Since 2010, the North East lost 2,021 police officers.\nBut they’re statistics. Just this week I saw a man in a green sleeping bag on a bench in Jesmond. He was there the week before. Would you swap your life with his?\nI spoke to a woman in early 60’s who’d had her pension age pushed back by the government. She had to go back to work as an apprentice on a building site, climbing scaffolding for minimum wage just to pay her rent. Her joints ache every day. I know of parents torn between using payday lenders or their kids being bullied because they won’t get a genuine NUFC strip for Christmas.\nLater this week, you get to choose who designs that society.\nYou could choose Boris Johnson, who said, “The modern British male is useless. If he is blue collar, he is likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless, and perhaps claiming to suffer from low self-esteem brought on by unemployment. If he is white collar, he is likely to be little better.”\nHis plan for supporting single mams? “If having a baby out of wedlock meant sure-fire destitution on a Victorian scale, young girls might indeed think twice about having a baby.”\nDoes that sound like the architect of a secure future? Or his plan to boost prostitution and crime? It’s a throwback to Ebenezer Scrooge who said, “Are there no prisons? And the workhouses, are they still in operation?”\nOr you could vote to make Jeremy Corbyn Prime Minister. A man who told me, “We need to stop this idea that society is all about competition. It’s simply unsustainable to have a system where only the most talented do well and everyone else struggles. Everyone has something to offer.”\nSo let’s design society where top 5% pay a bit more tax. If you’re on £80,000 or more, it’s in your enlightened self interest to pay for Sure Start, for a working probation service, for better schools. For more kids grow up to be scientists and doctors.\nNext time you see a victim of drug abuse, face sallow from the cycle of shoplifting and prostitution, think there but for the grace of God, go I. She was once a new born baby with her whole life ahead of her. Collectively we have failed her. It’s time to face up to the future, and build a society that works for everybody.

Do You Get It?\nDecember 8, 2019\n“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs” starts Rudyard Kipling’s poem If-. “Then perhaps it’s because you don’t understand the situation…” continues the joke.\nOn Monday, I met with Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England. We touched on many things, including making our economy sustainable.\nHe agrees with his boss, Mark Carney, that the climate crisis will destroy our economy unless we face up to it. Why would two sober-minded establishment pillars make this claim?\nMark Carney speaks of a “global financial collapse”. £20tn (that’s trillion!) wiped off asset prices when the world realises we can no longer burn our oil reserves. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Literally. When the Greenland ice sheet melts, it will add 7m to sea levels. Bye-bye Netherlands, Bangladesh, Manhattan, and parts of London. The financial impacts will hit long before the sea encroaches. Our financial system is interconnected like a game of global Jenga. And as ever, ordinary people will pay. Insurance will be declined. Homes will become worthless. Pensions will default.\nOn Tuesday, I met with Nick Baveystock, chief exec of the Institute of Civil Engineers. He’s a sober-minded career soldier who ran the Royal Engineers’ training centre. We agreed about the shortage of British engineers. We’re working on getting kids into STEM subjects. Especially kids in less affluent schools. We need hands-on projects to engage kids. Working wind turbines, irrigated urban gardens. Learn from doing, and gain the sense of achievement of building something real. The teachers I speak to would love this – they’re sick of testing kids for the sake of it.\nOn Wednesday, Nature published an article. It is the most prestigious scientific publication in the world. Do yourself a favour and Google “Nature Climate Tipping Points”. If nothing else, you’ll be able to impress your friends.\nThe problem, says the article, is that climate change is non-linear. Once part of the Earth’s system gets thrown out of kilter, it affects everything else.\nIce melting in Greenland slows down the ocean currents. This affects West African monsoons, dries-out the Amazon, and accelerates Antarctic ice melting. If that happens, it shortens our window to prevent runaway climate change from 10 years to 8 years. The authors cite thirty such interacting tipping points.\nBut it won’t be the weather that will collapse civilisation. It will be migration. Even if we hit the Paris agreements, average global temperatures will rise by over 3 degrees. Every degree of rise lowers global food production between 5 to 10%. 1.817 billion people will be hungry. Wheat production in India will drop by 70%. Pakistan will become a desert. Bangladesh waterlogged.\nWe’ve seen Syrians so desperate they’ll risk drowning in overcrowded dinghies. Syria had a pre-war population of 21m. India, Bangladesh and Pakistan have 1.7 billion people. And two nuclear armed states.\nOn Thursday I met with Nigel Powell of EduCCate Global. They’re delivering the United Nations’ climate teacher accreditation in North of Tyne. We’re working out how to extend it to kids and community groups. If you’re a teacher, and want to sign up for the free course, get in touch via our website.\nThursday night saw the Channel 4 climate debate. Johnson and Farage didn’t care enough to show up. Come to think of it, I’ve never seen them in the same place together. They were empty chaired, replaced by melting blocks of ice. Satire at its sharpest.\nOn Friday, I walked into town with my kids and spoke at the school climate strike. Many hundreds crowded outside the Civic Centre. Fifteen to eighteen year olds spoke with impressive eloquence on the need for economic system change. The language was less technical than the Bank of England’s, but the message was the same. Without massive public investment in clean energy and public transport, we’ll crash. It’s their futures, and they know it.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I support the school strikers, and I support Extinction Rebellion. If you don’t, my guess is that you haven’t understood the situation.\nIn Game of Thrones, Winter was coming. I’m afraid for us, it’s climate change.\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 2nd December 2019",

The title track seems thematically inspired by David Bowie’s Kooks. Both are about a dad advising his kids not to get stressed by the expectations society places on them.\nI grew up with The Specials. I vividly remember the black & white chequered cover on the audio cassette of their debut album. That was before CDs. To find Ultra Modern Nursery Rhyme back in 1990 I had to place a special order. Now you just download.\nTheir eponymous debut album shot them to fame. It’s a classic. Brimming with the energy of ska rhythm and deep bass, punctuated by brass. The originality of songs like Stupid Marriage and Too Much Too Young – lyrical cautions against teenage pregnancy.\nTheir articulate nihilism is expressed in Man at C&A – the helplessness against world events and uncaring politicians. Women forced into sex work in Hey Little Rich Girl. The simple sadness of watching an ageing woman clinging to her youth in Pearl’s Café. The alcoholism decried in Stereotype. The Specials were not just angry young men.\nAnd, of course, Ghost Town. If you lived through the Thatcher years, you know this song. Never has there been a more accurate musical social commentary. Government leaving the youth on the shelf.\nThey could have been the band of 2022. The stalking terror of knife crime articulated in Concrete Jungle. The song Too Hot. The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum should be Liz Truss’s theme song.\n“Nothing’s changed! When we wrote it we had Reagan and Thatcher and we thought things couldn’t get worse. Now we’ve got Trump and May!” said Terry Hall in a 2016 interview.\nLunatics was Hall’s first post-Specials track, with the new band Fun Boy Three. He’d started writing it before splitting from The Specials with Neville Staple and guitarist Lynval Golding.\nThe Specials only had about 18 months of fame before they split. Five top 10 singles and two No 1s in under two years. Hall speaks of the pressures they were under. Being targeted by the far right. The National Front turning up and Sieg-Heiling at them on stage. The violence at the gigs, which led to him being arrested, charged and fined for incitement.\n“Getting picked up at the airport was a drama, checking into the hotel was a drama, leaving the hotel was a drama. You couldn’t get any space, not even for an hour or two, because wherever you went there were these lads who’d travelled 9,000 miles to see you live and didn’t have anywhere to stay, so you had to put them up in your room and then you had to sit up all night with them. Talking about the f**king Specials.”\nI can’t talk about the Specials without Jerry Dammers. Their artistic inspiration and lead songwriter. In fact, it’s Jerry Dammers GCOT. That’s Grand Companion of OR Tambo. Now that’s one honour I’d salute. Dammers was awarded it for his anti-apartheid work, including writing the song Free Nelson Mandela, another staple of my teenage years.\nThe Specials’ It Doesn’t Make it Alright is an explicitly anti-racist anthem. Their legacy lived on when in 2017, 20 year old Saffiyah Khan calmly smiled while staring down an EDL thug. The photo of her wearing a Specials t-shirt went viral.\nHall spoke about his mental health. He’d suffered horrific child sex abuse at the hands of a teacher, and sang about it in Well Fancy That.\n“It got to a point where I didn’t have a choice – and it’s done me so much good,” he said. “Talking about mental health problems is a conscious decision. It’s something I want to share with people.”\nSeeking help seemed to make a difference. He was much happier with his later musical collaborations. And life in general.\n“I also bloody love being 60. I’ve wanted to be 60 since I was in my twenties. I’ve always thought I’d make my best music in the years between 60 and 70.” Sadly, he died aged 63.\nAs Terry Hall himself sang: Enjoy yourself. It’s later than you think.",

Water!\nAh, Christmas cracker jokes. I love Christmas. I’m not a religious man but Christmas embodies so many traditions core to my beliefs. Family and friends. Helping each other out. Communities coming together to sing carols. Taking time to cook a good meal, and the time to eat it in good company. I love snow, even more since having kids, but that’s not guaranteed.\nI’ve also just had a week off which was very welcome. Spending time with my wife and kids, listening to Christmas songs and watching films. This might be controversial, but I reckon the best film version of A Christmas Carol is by the Muppets. Miss Piggy troughing chestnuts is comedy gold. It also brilliantly conveys the story of Scrooge. Michael Caine insisted on playing the role like he was with the Royal Shakespeare Company. It’s perfectly judged and gives the film real weight. The wilful ignorance and the ‘I’m alright Jack, pull the ladder up’ mentality. You’ll all know people like this, things haven’t changed that much, sadly. People hunker down in their homes because there are so few places we can meet without having to buy something. It’s getting harder and harder for communities to hold together.\nMy Christmas Past was walking down the high street with my Mam. We would drop into the butchers, greengrocers, maybe even the sweet shop as a Christmas treat. I remember the sense of community. Bumping into neighbours and friends who stopped to chat. The shopkeepers knew us.\nThe Christmas Present on our high streets is quite different. Betting shops, takeaways, and the all too common sight of people sleeping rough. I don’t remember rough sleepers from my childhood. Too many shops are chain stores, all high streets are starting to look the same. Too few independents with local character and individuality. Where it does exist it’s the exception and regarded with pride.\nWhat’s in store for our Christmas Future?\nImagine this. You’re walking down a high street which is rich with life. You know exactly where you are because it’s unique. It reflects the uniqueness of the community and the history of the area. Of course it does because they helped build it. The first shop is a repair café. You can pop in with your vacuum cleaner or broken spade and get it patched up. It’s such a waste throwing things away when they can be fixed.\nThe next shop is a greengrocer who specialises in food grown locally, from farmers and surplus from allotments. When people want local, seasonal fruit and veg this is where they come.\nThe next shop is a remakery. I say shop, it’s more like a workshop. It’s full of tools and equipment. A place where you can learn a range of practical skills that were being forgotten. You can learn woodwork, needlework, metalwork. If there is someone to teach it, you can do it here. It celebrates the ingenuity of people and skills. The generosity of spirit is infectious and has created a warm and welcoming place for people of all ages to swap stories and make friends.\nPayday lenders have been replaced by credit unions and a community bank. There’s still the odd betting shop and few takeways. Who doesn’t like a takeaway every now and then? But they’re part of an interesting array of shops, uniquely local.\nThis can happen. A community can come together and decide to create a more vibrant place to socialise and shop.\n‘The past we inherit, the future we build.’\nJohn Lennon’s Happy Xmas challenges us, asking, “So this is Christmas, and what have you done?” Well this year I became Mayor. I stood because I’m convinced we can create a society better than the one we have now. Climate change, inequality and job insecurity are all reasons I worry about the future for my kids, and everyone else’s. Community is the key to addressing this. So let’s keep the Christmas spirit all year round.\nThis article was first published in The Chronicle and The Journal on Monday 30th December 2019.",

Nicola Adams. Pythagoras. Eliud Kipchoge. Haile Gebrselassie. Nadia Comaneci.\nAll Olympic champions.\nNo, that’s not a mistake, although it’s true that you’re more likely to associate Pythagoras with triangles, rather than the Olympics.\nPythagoras didn’t win an Olympic crown for doing difficult sums. He won for boxing. And, at the time – 588 BCE – there were no weight classes, only a boys’ category and a men’s. So you had no idea how enormous, or strong, your opponent might be.\nIt was a huge honour to be selected to represent your city-state or small kingdom. There were no cash prizes, and no medals. If you won, you were awarded a crown made of leaves – probably bay or basil. There was nothing for the athletes who came second or third. You might have had a statue erected, and be given money by your hometown when you returned triumphant. But at Olympia, you competed for the glory of being an Olympian. If you were a free man, that is. Women weren’t allowed to compete. Or even to watch – athletes competed barefoot and naked.\nThank heaven that’s changed. It was great to watch the mixed triathlon at the Tokyo Games – and even better to watch Team GB get the gold. The relay changeover part, where they run and dive into the water, looked so much fun – I’d love to have a go at that. But I’ll leave the high-speed dismount and run with the bike to the Olympians. And if you haven’t seen Charlotte Worthington’s BMX freestyle run, do yourself a favour and watch it on YouTube:\nFor the vast majority of us, we experience sport by watching it. Often glass, or can, in hand, and with snacks on the side. We don’t take part. Except in cheering.\nAnd yet, immediately after Wimbledon, there are more kids on the tennis courts. After athletics competitions, there are more people running.\nWe need to use the power of the Olympics, and other sporting events, not just to get people interested in watching, but to get them taking part.\nYou can pretty much guarantee that Sky Brown, the 13 year old skateboarding Olympian, will inspire a new generation of young skateboarders. But how easy will they find it to get to a usable skatepark? Or one that they can afford?\nWe need grassroots access to all sports. So people aren’t put off either by price, distance – including decent public transport and secure bike parking – and the funding of equipment and grassroots clubs. Too much open space is being built on. Too many school fields sold to fund education. Too many sport centres and swimming pools closed by austerity.\nI want to do something about that.\nWorking with one of those Olympic greats, Sir Brendan Foster, there are already plans afoot for a Great North Festival of Sport. The aim is to increase daily exercise levels for ordinary people and getting them to participate in sports of all kinds. This isn’t for elite athletes. This is for you and me.\nThe Combined Authority is also working on a year-round events programme of high-quality cultural and sporting events capable of achieving regional, national, and international profiles.\nI taught jiu jitsu for decades – I’m a black belt myself. One of the most rewarding aspects was watching people start to see themselves differently, and realise the inner strength that they never knew they had. That’s what sport can do for us.\nBack to Sir Brendan. I’ve agreed (for which read ‘was talked into it by Brendan’) to put my money where my running shoes are and run the Great North Run on Sunday 12th September. I’m fundraising for a fantastic charity, Forward Assist, www.forward-assist.com. Based in the North East, they help veterans across the country transition from military service into civilian life. Everything from accessing health services to setting up businesses.\nBritish swimmer Adam Peaty said at the Olympics recently: ‘It’s a fun event and that’s what sport needs. It needs to be fun.’ I imagine after these Games there’ll be a lot of young people thinking that the Sky’s the limit.

NASA has just reported that of the 19 warmest years on record, 18 were since 2001, and the threats – which are extraordinary – are escalating. It’s therefore most encouraging to learn that Jamie Driscoll is planning to work to implement a Green New Deal, if elected.\nNoam Chomsky\nPolicy: A Green New Deal: Global Means Local!\n“Climate Change is the single biggest threat to life, security and prosperity on Earth,” said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa.\nThe UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report this autumn warned that humanity has just 11 years left to take emergency action in order to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown.\nClimate change hits the poorest in society and we are already seeing its impact across the globe. The UK will be hit hard if action is not taken now: forecasts predict a trebling of deaths caused by extreme heat by the year 2050, with more frequent and severe disruptive flooding events, and an increasingly perilous food supply. As flood-prone homes become uninsurable and impossible to sell, as food prices rise, and as air quality worsens, those least able to fend for themselves will suffer the worst. Strong environmental policy is a matter of justice. And it must be a priority.\nThis is a global threat – and requires local action. We cannot leave it to others. That’s why I’m making a commitment to act on the scale and at the pace required. I will push the boundaries of the Mayor’s role to influence others to take bold action, to tackle climate change, improve our environment, and build a sustainable economy that works for the many, not the few.\nA Green New Deal combines economic sustainability with environmental sustainability. Giving the North of Tyne area a more democratic, locally owned economy will increase employment and wages, and reduce the environmental stress we place on our planet.\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) outline the positive steps that can be taken to integrate urgent climate change action with reducing poverty and improving quality of life. Here is the framework for the actions I propose.\nAs Mayor I will:\nDeclare a Climate Emergency\n- Upon taking office I will declare a Climate Emergency.\n- Parliament has agreed to a 40% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030 (based on 1990 levels) This is not sufficient to limit the worst effects of climate change on our communities.\n- Pursue a net-zero carbon policy by 2030. This will involve working with the local councils and partners across the region.\n- A Climate Change Liaison Group will be established immediately and will involve Councillors, residents, young citizens and experts from our Universities and other relevant parties. Funds will be allocated to provide skilled staff to support the work of the Climate Change Liaison Group.\n- The Group will review the current Climate Change Strategy and help local Councils and other partners develop a new carbon budget taking into account both production and consumption of emissions by 2020.\n- Convene a Citizens’ Assembly in 2019 to identify how the region’s activities might be made net-zero carbon by 2030.\n- Support divestment from fossil fuels across the public sector within 3 years, including pension fund divestment.\nProvide World Class Environmental Education\n- Education is the key to enabling many other UN Sustainable Development Goals. Quality education unlocks human potential, empowering people to escape the cycle of poverty.\n- In its first year, the Mayor’s Authority will develop a team of specialists to engage school kids in the science and the behavioural changes needed for climate action, including how to grow food and tackle food waste.\n- Fund adult education to make the North of Tyne the leader in the skills needed to implement the 1 Million Climate Jobs Agenda. Tackling climate change goes hand-in-hand with providing high-quality green jobs.\n- Support the capabilities of our Universities and Industries to gain additional research funding into environmental technology as part of our social transformation.\nTackle Food Waste: Social and Economic Benefits\n- The UK currently wastes 10 million tonnes of food each year and this is expected to rise by a further 1.1 million by 2025.\n- Reduce food waste in line with the UN goal of halving the amount of food waste by 2030.\n- Work with supermarkets to reduce food waste. This can be achieved through better inventory management, and distributing unsold food to foodbanks, food co-operatives, and pay-as-you-feel community cafes.\n- Reduce food miles. Public sector catering, such as school and works’ canteens will be linked with local food producers, tailoring menus to source local ingredients. Private sector caterers will be encouraged to do the same.\n- Promote local food growth and urban gardening.\n- Lobby businesses & promote Sustainability Awards for those that reduce plastic usage.\nDeliver Renewable Energy: Creating Sustainable Communities\n- Set up a Community Owned Power Company that supplies green energy.\n- Run the Mayoral authority on 100% sustainable electricity.\n- Work with local communities to ensure they benefit from cooperatively owned renewable generation, maximising the number of possible sites for energy-generating installations.\n- Support innovations in the peer-to-peer market to provide a cooperative alternative to energy companies exploitation of householders who have solar panels – enabling them to sell electricity to local suppliers.\n- Promote climate technology and innovation in the area of biofuels, microgeneration, and energy efficiency technologies. Working with universities, start-ups, and innovation funding agencies, make the North of Tyne a world leader in green energy.\nCreate Sustainable Land Use: Agriculture, Housing and Greenspace\n- Build cooperatively-owned fair-rent community housing that locks carbon away in its construction, has the highest standards of energy efficiency, and includes viable micro-generation. This will help combat both homelessness and fuel poverty.\n- Establish Community Land Trusts where people can buy their own homes, built using carbon-sequestration to lock carbon away. Environmentally-aware planning creates communities with local services, reducing car journeys.\n- Fundamental reform is required to ensure land becomes a more effective carbon store, whilst early action is needed to maximise the benefits from changing how land is used. The UK report on land use recommends significant change in land use is necessary to create a sustainable society.\n- Accelerate tree planting, involving schools, voluntary organisations, and community and religious groups. This may be encouraged by the use of grants and funding support.\n- Identify areas of land that are unsuitable for other uses, specifically within urban environments. These can be rewilded by planting trees and improving biodiversity.\n- Alternative uses of land can be economic for farmers and land managers, but Government must provide help for this. I will work with the Government to define a new land strategy.\nThese are the Green New Deal headlines. There is much more to do such as improving cycling facilities and public transport, and making full use of environmental sustainability clauses in public sector supply contracts.\nBy taking a lead on these policies, and providing the initial money to get them started, we can enable further funding to be available. We can make a start locally to combat the climate crisis we face.\nA red-green agenda can make sure that tackling climate change creates wealth and high quality employment within our communities, by encouraging local production and consumption – making and using things locally. Only by matching environmental sustainability with the democratisation of our local economies can we mitigate a climate disaster.",

Instead of our innovators leaving the region, they’ll grow their businesses here, and keep money and jobs in the region. The profits will return to the Combined Authority. This is Community Wealth Building on steroids.\nI will expand this fund to £500 million, levering in pension fund investment, which will create 14,000 new jobs in homegrown industries. And once the markets have calmed down, and local businesses have recovered from the pandemic, we’ll progress setting up the cooperatively owned People’s Bank.\nWe’ve negotiated £80 million from government over the next five years. This will create jobs in and around Blyth, along the Tyne, at IAMP near Nissan, and in NETPark near Sedgefield.\nI’ll boost our inward investment team – already one of Britain’s most successful – to actively pursue investment here, building on the 8 big tech companies we’ve landed here already. Investors gain confidence when they can speak to a Mayor who understands their business and help them grow.\nAnd we have specific industrial strategy programmes for the rural economy, manufacturing, digital, offshore renewables, culture and creative, hospitality and tourism, healthy ageing, decarbonisation and specialist support for local microbusinesses.\nThese funds lever in 15 to 20 times the initial investment. I’ll scale these up and hit the ground running so Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland and Durham all benefit. This approach is proven to work.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_straight-answers-to-straight-questions/content_149.html": "Straight answers to straight questions\nOctober 22, 2023\n“Before I refuse to take your questions, I have an opening statement,” said Ronald Regan. It’s a witty line, but I doubt he wrote it himself. Yet it embodies a truth of modern politics.\nPrime Ministers’ Questions resembles a game show. ‘You have one minute, and you must deviate, deflect and insult your opponent. Actually answering the question will result in disqualification.’\nIf you’ve had enough, there is an alternative. Come along to Mayor’s Question Time on Tuesday, and I’ll give you a straight answer to a straight question.\nIt’s in One Strawberry Place in Newcastle, next to St James. 6:30pm to 7:30pm, Tuesday 24th October. Tickets are free – Google ‘Jamie Driscoll Mayor’s Question Time.’ The theme is ‘How can devolution get us to net-zero?’ But you can ask me anything about my work as your Mayor.\nI like answering questions. On Monday I spoke at the North East Passenger Transport Users’ Group. After speaking, the questions came thick and fast about detail. Our public transport is not nearly good enough, and that results in traffic congestion. The £billions in transport funding we’re getting from our new devolution deal can help. My vision is a Total Transport Network. Integrated buses, Metro and rail, with secure bike parking and access to car clubs. With free travel for under 18s. All under public control. It’s better for the environment, for our health, and for our pockets.\nOn Wednesday Iain Dale asked the questions for his All Talk podcast. Starting with, “You’ve got an interesting family background.” My Dad driving a tank through Berlin. My Mam’s work against domestic violence. Meeting my wife at jiu jitsu. My journey to becoming an Independent Mayor. I’ll share it on social media when it’s published.\nOn Thursday I got to ask the questions at our latest Mayor’s Equalities Assembly. We’re working with employers who want to build a more diverse workforce. Getting into the detail and hearing experiences from the front line helps us drill-down and find practical solutions. Too much of politics is grandiose statements. Too little is getting stuff done. Actions speak louder than words.\nThursday evening was my latest campaign meeting, in South Shields this time. A hall packed with those who’d braved Storm Babet asked questions about my record as North of Tyne Mayor and what I’d do as North East Mayor. Literally no one trusts Westminster politics. Does anyone trust Mr Sunak? I asked. Not a hand went up. Does anyone trust Sir Keir Starmer? Again, not one person. People want someone free to put place before Party, and just get on with the job. And maybe give them a bit of hope.\nBut hope is in short supply these days. The scale of the human catastrophe unfolding in the middle east is terrible. The war in Ukraine continues to heap misery on civilians. Not to mention the ongoing conflicts in Yemen or the DRC. I want to see the UK supporting the UN in dialogue and de-escalation. Starting with a ceasefire in Palestine, the return of Israeli hostages and the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. On Friday I joined Show Racism the Red Card’s day of action. Cllr Habib Rahman spoke powerfully about not letting our anger and revulsion at atrocities and war crimes spill over into Islamophobia and antisemitism.\nWe face a cost-of-living-crisis. A climate emergency. A housing crisis. A healthcare crisis. Local councils facing bankruptcy and near universal distrust of political leaders.\nAll we get is political noughts and crosses. Instead of a plan, Mr Sunak tilts at windmills. Recycling bins. A non-existent meat tax. Then announces a terrible policy, granting new fossil fuel licences or keeping children in poverty – cross. Sir Keir shouts and throws his arms up, but quietly admits he won’t reverse the decision – nought. Cancelling each other out, while the real challenges remain unaddressed. A futile game that achieves nothing.\nPolitics is dominated by zero-sum thinking – my gain is your loss. It’s not true. All our public services, all our private wealth is only generated once we get beyond conflict and start to focus on solutions. And that can only happen if we answer questions honestly.\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 23 Oct 2023",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_how-has-politics-got-to-this-state/content_37.html": "How has politics got to this state?\nMarch 3, 2024\n“Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked tonight here in Rochdale.” Not exactly diplomatic from George Galloway. But there’s a shortage of diplomacy in British politics right now.\nThe Prime Minister then made the bizarre decision to make a speech on Friday evening outside No 10. He described the decision of the Rochdale electorate as “beyond alarming.”\nI find it beyond alarming that a Prime Minister censures the democratic choice of the people of Rochdale. Condemning the electorate is a serious anti-democratic development.\nIf you’ve lost the confidence of the electorate, Mr Sunak, that’s on you to fix. Don’t blame them.\nDon’t blame them if they think you’re a hypocrite. You can’t condemn racist “poison” and refuse to call out Lee Anderson’s overt Islamophobia.\nThe speech made lots of vague allegations about violent extremists. Shadowy forces. There is too much racism, he said, but then said Britain doesn’t have a problem with racism. It read like the first draft of a speech that hadn’t been edited.\nLee Anderson was vice-chair of the Conservative Party. He said the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was under the “control” of “Islamists”. Conservative HQ sent out minister after minister to say Mr Anderson was “wrong” but when pressed, they all refused to say it was racist or Islamophobic.\nI know Sadiq Khan well. I’ve worked with him for years. He’s a liberal, London human rights lawyer. He has campaigned for LGBTQ equality. He’s about as far away from wanting a theocracy as it’s possible to be.\nLabour faced severe criticism for defending their Rochdale candidate for 48 hours after his anti-Israeli conspiracy theory comments surfaced. They dropped him, eventually, but the timing meant he was still on the ballot. The Green Party had already dropped their candidate for Islamophobic remarks implying all Palestinians had genocidal intent. In defence of the Greens, they did it quickly and without fuss, not holding on until media pressure forced their hand.\nAnd if you think the North East is immune to the racist virus sweeping the country, think again.\nLabour’s candidate for North East Mayor, Kim McGuinness, has been challenged to apologise for a Tweet described as racist by The Traveller Movement, who represent Romani, Roma and Irish Travellers. This first came to light in July last year. There was no action for seven months. Last month, again, only after media pressure, the Labour Party issued a statement saying Ms McGuinness had apologised. But there is no record of any such apology. The Labour Party also declined to accept it was racist, mirroring the Conservative stance on Lee Anderson.\nIt’s escalating. Last week The Traveller Movement emailed all councillors in the North East confirming they had received no apology or engagement of any kind. Making an offensive statement is bad enough. Denying it is racist compounds the offense. And if it transpires that Ms MGuinness has made untrue comments about apologising, as is alleged, Labour may have to replace their Mayoral candidate, like in Rochdale. There have already been calls for her to resign.\nHow has politics got to this state? The Office for National Statistics report last week said only 12% of Britons trust political Parties. And that data was collected in September and October – before Labour’s £28 billion U-turn, some of it before the 7th October attacks and events in Gaza.\nWhere there is a vacuum, something will fill it.\nMr Sunak said in his Friday address, that “it is not where you were born that will determine your success but just your own hard work and endeavour.” What utter rubbish.\nI’m a big believer in hard work. But to deny that inequality exists and affects life chances is a Flat Earth level of denial. How many of our Prime Ministers went to Eton?\nLabour and the Conservatives both agree on keeping the 2-child benefit cap. A policy that keeps 45,000 kids in the North East in poverty. 1 in 8 children. Enough to fill the Stadium of Light.\nBoth Labour and Conservative want to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses. Both are promising near-identical austerity.\nNo wonder people are turning to independents. The underreported story about Rochdale is that Independent David Tully, standing on a platform of localism, got more votes than Labour and Conservatives combined.\nThe job of politicians is to fix things. We need an honest appraisal of the state we’re in, and a plan to get out of it. I’ve got one for the North East – full employment, a Green New Deal, and a Total Transport Network.\nSo while I might disagree with many of Mr Galloway’s remarks, his “backside” comment encapsulates what most of Britain is thinking.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_beware-of-the-leopard/content_219.html": "Beware of the Leopard\nMay 16, 2021\nTown planning is as old as cities. The Romans did it. In fact, the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro in the Indus Valley had a planned water and sanitation system 2,600 years before Hadrian’s Wall was built.\nAs Britain moved out of the medieval era, towns grew. People lived closer together, and governments needed to minimise disputes. The risk of fire spreading from building to building had to be controlled. Thatch has been banned on roofs, street widths controlled, and bricks and slates made mandatory in most places since the Great Fire of London in 1666. Grenfell Tower gave us a harsh reminder of what happens when corners are cut and safety comes second.\nIn 1947 the planning system brought together various competing interests for the first time. The main push was to improve living standards through better quality housing. It also considered place-making, green spaces and community facilities. Planning featured strongly in the 1942 Beveridge Report. It demonstrated the link between good town planning and an effective welfare state.\nPlanning is not just about safety and aesthetics. It has an economic impact. The amount of land given over to car parking, the ease a bus can navigate an estate. The ability to travel to and from work, college, the shops or cinema are all affected by planning decisions. So are the density and locations of GP surgeries and schools. Good planning improves our health and prosperity and protects us from a free-for-all of short-termism. It’s interesting that the NHS has kept its special place in the heart of the nation but the value of planning is unsung.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of the 1947 system was placing development rights under public control. Landowners lost the right to develop indiscriminately on their own land. Using land for existing uses was unchanged, but new uses required planning permission. These decision making powers were given to local councils. It heralded the biggest shift in power between land owners and ordinary citizens in British history.\nSince 2010 council planning departments across England have suffered budget cuts of over 50%. Developers spend £millions paying lawyers to find loopholes and haggle down the public benefit. If they can make an argument for not building a school, or reducing the number of affordable homes, they add £millions to their bottom line. It’s a David and Goliath battle.\nIn last week’s Queen’s speech the government pledged to change planning laws. Areas will be designated for ‘growth’, ‘protection’ or ‘regeneration’. In ‘growth’ zones, developers can build without needing individual planning consents.\nLocal Authorities will have to develop Local Plans designating these zones. You’ll be permitted to comment when your Local Plan is drawn up. But that plan will last at least ten years. Imagine contacting your council to object to a development only to discover you should have objected 10 years ago.\nIt’s like the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Arthur Dent discovers they plan to flatten his home the day before the bulldozers arrive.\n“But, Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months,” he’s told. “You found the notice, didn’t you?”\n“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.’”\nI’m in favour of reforming planning laws. They should commit to affordable, zero-carbon homes, increasing bio-diversity and protecting our natural world. And maintaining the right for people to influence what happens to the places where they live.\nI spoke to Robert Jenrick MP, the Secretary of State, about this some months ago. It was clear to me he’d already made up his mind. In January last year, Mr Jenrick was asked by Richard Desmond to overrule a previous planning decision. Desmond was building a £1 billion development along the Thames. Jenrick did as his billionaire friend asked. This intervention saved Desmond from paying £45 million to the Community Infrastructure Levy – money for schools, cycle lanes, affordable housing, and parks. Two weeks later, Mr Desmond donated £12,000 to the Conservative Party. Draw your own conclusions.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 17 May 2021",

(It’s not a Christmas cracker joke). They’re all part of our year-long programme of cultural events. Backed with £2.6 million funding from the North of Tyne, these – and others – are taking place across our region in 2022.\n“Industry Without Art is Brutality”. That’s the slogan of the Artists’ Union England has across their banner. They’re a recently-formed trade union for creatives, and I think their slogan nails it.\nGood jobs, warm, secure housing, public services and a clean environment are all vital for a decent and dignified life. Yes, culture creates jobs. But without art and culture our life would be sterile, our wellbeing incomplete. That can mean everything from a Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition at The Laing to being on the terraces at St. James’ (regardless of the result).\nCulture enriches our emotional world and mental health. It promotes social solidarity and inclusion. It makes us happy. It’s no accident that medics are increasingly using social subscribing. Evidence proves that people with depression benefit from arts activities. We all do. That means our £2.6million Culture and Creative Programme is a sound investment in our collective wellbeing.\nIf you’ve read Dan Jackson’s fantastic book, The Northumbrians, you’ll know our region has deep and diverse cultural roots. A rich literary heritage stretches back to the seventh century manuscripts produced by the monks at Lindisfarne and Jarrow. Our history of mining and shipbuilding gave us traditions of working-class solidarity and communalism as well as The Pitmen Painters.\nOur programme reflects this cultural diversity. There are high profile events, like the return of the 1,300 year old Lindisfarne Gospels to the North East. They’ll be on display at The Laing throughout the autumn. Exiled in London since they were taken from Durham Cathedral in the 1530s by Henry Tudor’s men, Dan Jackson describes them as Northumbria’s Elgin Marbles.\nCulture isn’t all about looking at things. Taking part can be even more fun. Our Crowdfund North of Tyne supports projects from local wartime history to community film making.\nOur North of Tyne Under the Stars story-telling events, through January and February, will weave together the stories from places across our region. There’ll be free events in neighbourhoods from Hexham to North Shields, all leading up to a spectacular festival in Newcastle in early February (Covid allowing!). This is the first event of its kind in our region. Stories give us a sense of who we are and where we belong. Story-telling is a fundamental part of being human. The North East has a rich heritage, and this event will enable our communities to tell their own stories.\nCulture is dynamic. There is not, and never has been, a fixed and easily defined “Britishness”. The movement of peoples from other cultural heritages have shaped our regional for millennia.\nOur Hadrian’s Wall 1900 events celebrate the 1900th anniversary of its construction. Today it’s an iconic UNESCO World Heritage Site. But writing on a freezing winter’s day, I’m imagining the shock it must have been for those Roman soldiers stationed here. Coming to this cold, edge of empire outpost in the wilds of Cumbria and Northumberland. Chesters housed troops from Syria. At Carlisle, Algerians, and at Arbeia (South Shields) there were Iraqi bargemen from the Tigris. Their diet will have changed too. Food is a big part of culture.\nThere’s evidence that some of them put down roots here, and maybe had some influence on local culture. Over the following centuries our regional culture and identity has been shaped by movements of other peoples. Anglo Saxons, Norse and Normans and in more recent times the Irish diaspora from the nineteenth century onwards. You don’t have to go back very far to see that we’ve always been influenced – and enriched – by sharing cultural traditions. (And Stewart Lee does a great comedy routine on this).\nAnd it will continue – we’ve recently welcomed to our region families fleeing from persecution and war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. They too, will help shape our culture and contribute to our cultural life.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 10 Jan 2022",

Emergency services, NHS staff, catering and hospitality workers. Taxi drivers, people staffing petrol stations.\nAnd for many people who work, and many who can’t get reliable work, the money will run out. Personal debt is an epidemic. Everyone I know has made a donation to a foodbank or toy donations. It’s both heartening that people care, and heart rending that we need to.\nWe’re in the 21st century, in one of the richest countries ever to exist. Yet people are working for a living and their kids are still in poverty. There’s something profoundly wrong in the way our country works.\nOne of my favourite Xmas songs is Stop the Cavalry by Jona Lewie, whose birth name was, in a Christmas coincidence, John Lewis. Intended as an anti-war song, it has become a Christmas classic.\nPerhaps it’s near the top of my list because when it was first released I was growing up. US nuclear cruise missiles were being stationed in the UK at Greenham Common, and fear of nuclear war was palpable.\nBut mainly it’s because of the lyrics. Two lines stick out.\n“I have had to fight almost every night, down throughout these centuries. That is when I say, oh yes yet again, can you stop the cavalry?”\nFor generations we’ve been led into wars, started by leaders who were not acting in our interest. They sent our brothers and fathers and sons off to war. It’s always the common soldiers who pay the price. The civilians whose deaths are labelled as collateral damage. Generation after generation, down throughout these centuries, we’ve failed to look after soldiers returning from war.\nI’m not a pacifist. My family served in the armed forces. I’m a black belt in jiu jitsu, I’ve intervened as a Good Samaritan when I’ve seen women being attacked. In a time of crisis, force is necessary. But I’m struggling to think of a war that couldn’t have been avoided with stronger diplomacy and economic pressure. Violence must be the last resort, not the first response.\nThe other line that touches me even more is, “If I get home, live to tell the tale, I’ll run for all presidencies. If I get elected I’ll stop, I will stop the cavalry.”\nIt’s the simplicity and innocence of the line. So improbable and difficult against a political establishment, and yet such an obvious and direct solution. The idea that bringing about change requires only the political will to make change happen.\nNow I find myself in office as Mayor. I’m bringing jobs here. I’ve been meeting companies, and so has my team. Our inward investment programme was set up to create 600 new jobs. It’s been so successful that we’re expanding the programme. We’re now on target to bring 2000 jobs to our region. Good jobs – permanent jobs on decent terms and conditions.\nWork has to be a route out of poverty. In all previous hard times, unemployment was the scourge. Now we have in-work poverty.\nLast Tuesday, my cabinet has agreed our Good Work Pledge. We’ll accredit employers who meet high standards. Those who pay the Real Living Wage, offer stable hours, and in work progression. Who meet diversity and equality standards, give mental health support and flexible working. Who have a trade union recognition agreement. We’ll make it flexible enough so it’s easy for small and micro businesses so sign up.\nAccredited firms will get an advantage in winning public sector work. Enlightened employers understand that looking after people is good business sense. When you keep good staff, morale and productivity are higher.\nUnlike Jona Lewie, I did get elected. I don’t have power over foreign policy, and I can’t stop the cavalry. But I’m working my socks off to stop the poverty.\nThis article was first published in The Chronicle and The Journal on Monday 23rd December 2019. It is based on a previous blog post.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_its-not-the-cap-on-bankers-bonuses-holding-us-back/content_321.html": "It’s Not the Cap on Bankers’ Bonuses Holding us Back\nSeptember 25, 2022\nHow do we explain Mr Kwarteng’s mega-mini-budget? Why do something so obviously “up yours” to the working people of Britain as eliminating the top rate of tax for earners above £150,000, while sanctioning part-time, low-paid workers?\nEither he’s trying to fulfil Ms Truss’s ambition to be unpopular. Or he’s playing Santa Claus and delivering the Tory donors’ wish list. He’s succeeding in both.\nThe Tory backbenchers weren’t happy. The people of Blyth Valley weren’t dancing in the streets. Red Wall MPs will be thinking about their impending career changes.\nThe pound crashed – which will spike inflation. Interest rates will rise, along with mortgages and rents.\nThey have no mandate for this. 0.2% of the electorate voted for these policies – the 81,316 Tory members in the leadership race. Tory MPs were elected on a manifesto of levelling-up, not trickling down.\nThe theory of trickle-down is simple. Sometimes called supply-side economics, it claims that if rich people get a tax cut, they’ll invest all their extra money and create loads of jobs, the economy will grow, tax receipts will increase, and unicorns and bunny rabbits will frolic in sunlit uplands.\nIt doesn’t work. It never has. American supply-side politicians would say, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. The truth is, unless you can’t afford a yacht, a rising tide will drown you.\nThe International Monetary Fund, the champion of capitalist orthodoxy, said unambiguously, “when the rich get richer, benefits do not trickle down”. Research published in 2020 by the LSE, based on data from eighteen OECD countries including the UK, was even more damning. Tax cuts for the rich since the 1980s have increased income inequality without any gains in economic performance.\nYou’ve probably seen various budget calculators – where you put in your earnings and it tells you how much better or worse off you are. But they only tell half the story. Take the energy price-cap. With an average sized bill, you’ll be paying £2500 direct to the energy company. But you’ll also be paying another £2500 to the energy company via the Government. That’s still your money. That £2500 will inevitably be cut from your health service, your kids’ education, your parents social care, your police and fire services. If you work anywhere in the public sector, they’ll try to take it out of your wages. It should come from a windfall tax.\nEconomic prosperity has to be sustainable. At its simplest, growth is just more money changing hands. It doesn’t have to mean consumption of more material goods, or people buying bigger cars. We could spend more on health and education and youth services. More on retrofitting homes. More on better public transport. And enough to get to 100% clean energy production by building offshore wind farms and clean hydrogen production.\nWe could invest in public luxury. Libraries with modern computer suites. Publicly owned gardens and swimming pools and exercise classes. More live music and theatre and comedy.\nEvery business leader I talk to tells me the same thing. Growth stalls without skilled workers.\nAt the North of Tyne we’ve created a jobs pipeline of 4,635 jobs – over and above those from organic growth. We do it by working closely with businesses. Skills bootcamps that give both those in and out of work the training they need for a good green job.\nWe have skills programmes supporting people with neurodiversity. People who’ve struggled with drug and alcohol dependency. Carers who are returning to the labour market after years out. And we link it with our child poverty prevention work. Because getting someone a stable, fairly paid job on trade union terms and conditions is one of the best things you can do for them.\nAnd if you want to get more part-time workers working more hours, improve the care system. Child care is so expensive, and in many places so limited, that parents and carers can’t fit into normal working patterns.\nIt’s not the cap on bankers’ bonuses holding us back. City high-flyers on telephone number salaries are already in receipt of bonuses at a record high – £5.9 billion paid out in March alone. What we need is free life-long education and affordable childcare.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 25 Sept 2022",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_people-or-cars/content_257.html": "People or Cars?\nJanuary 22, 2023\n“All I need is the air that I breathe…” sang the Hollies nearly 50 years ago. It’s not literally all you need, but clean air is a UN-backed fundamental human right.\nIf you’re very young or very old, or have a condition like asthma, microscopic particles of burnt fuel or brake dust can put you in hospital. Hundreds of Tynesiders die prematurely every year from air pollution.\nYet the Government ignored this for a decade. In 2011, environment charity Client Earth took them to court for breaking their own laws, and won. But rather than take action, the Government dragged it out in the courts. Client Earth won again, twice. So in 2018 the Government decided to impose clean air zones across some of Britain’s pollution hotspots, in Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Greater Manchester, Portsmouth, Sheffield, and Tyneside.\nThe Clean Air Zone comes into effect on Monday, 30th January. It covers much of Newcastle city centre, and parts of Gateshead approaching the Tyne bridges. It won’t affect private cars, but will affect older taxis, buses, and lorries, and from July, vans. Most newer vehicles are already exempt because they’re less polluting. There’s full information online at the council websites, and breathe-cleanair.com.\nBy the way, please don’t email me – the North of Tyne is not involved. Our local councils administer it, and deserve full credit for the huge amount of work to minimise the financial impact to our residents and businesses. Owners of older vehicles can apply for grants to upgrade their vehicles. And if you hear someone say it’s just a money maker for the councils, it’s not true. They’re legally required to use all the money for running the scheme or transport improvements.\nNo one wants to be stuck in a traffic jam, breathing toxic air. But clean air is only part of the challenge. CO2 still accelerates climate change. Cars are expensive to own and run. Even electric vehicles use huge amounts of resources to build, and the electricity has to come from somewhere.\nAdd in the cost of owning and running a car, and it’s in everyone’s interest to get more cars off the road, including motorists. But we’ll get better results by using a carrot than a stick.\nBut where is the carrot today?\nGovernment has persistently failed to invest in high quality public transport outside of London. Transport spending per person in London was £882 in 2020 – more than double the North East’s funding. It’s hardly surprising London’s public transport system is better used. In 2021 76% of workers in the North East travelled to work by car. In London, it’s 27%.\nIt’s not just about money, it’s also about who decides how it’s spent.\nWe don’t currently have transport powers in the North of Tyne, because 40% of the Metro stations are in the South of Tyne area. But when the new North East devolution deal comes into effect in May 2024, on an expanded geographical footprint, it will be a game-changer. It includes £732 million in devolved transport funding over the next five years.\nWe’ll get powers to introduce bus franchising and decide routes, timetables and fares. Introduce integrated ticketing so passengers can switch easily between bus, Metro and the new Northumberland Line we’re opening between Ashington and Newcastle. We’ll be able to build new Metro routes, connecting places like Washington to the rail system. Imagine a public transport system that’s safe, reliable and affordable. That runs in the evening. That turns up on time. Where women and older people feel safe travelling at night.\nWe’ll be able to make cycling and walking more attractive and help us to get to net zero. And invest in secure bike parking – crime is a major reason people don’t cycle. Fewer than 10% of adults here cycle once a week. The number of children who walk to school in the North East has dropped by a quarter since 2009 – it’s now just 2 in 5 kids. Both of those numbers are far too low, with long term health consequences.\nSo yes – we need clean air to breathe. But we’ll do it best by redesigning our transport system around people, not cars.\nPhoto courtesy of Sustrans. ©2019, Sustrans, Chris Foster, all rights reserved.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_jamie-driscoll-urges-government-to-ensure-rough-sleepers-dont-return-to-streets-after-lockdown/content_185.html": "Jamie Driscoll Urges Government to Ensure Rough Sleepers Don’t Return to Streets After Lockdown\nMay 22, 2020\nNorth of Tyne Mayor Jamie Driscoll has urged the Government to ensure emergency measures to end rough sleeping continue once the lockdown is over.\nThe Government’s £3.2 million “Everyone In” scheme has helped get 4,500 rough sleepers off the streets, often by housing them in hotels.\nBut it’s unclear how long the policy will last, or what will happen once it’s over.\nThe Government plans to allow hotels to re-open in early July.\nMr Driscoll has joined forces with Labour leader Keir Starmer and four other mayors to write a joint letter to the Government.\nThey said: “The Government has rightly committed to protecting vulnerable rough sleepers for the duration of the pandemic.\n“However, the dedicated funding to house rough sleepers is set to run out and no clear plans or resources have been put in place by Government for what happens next.\n“The Government needs to provide clarity on their ‘Everyone In’ policy, to include those made homeless during the lockdown, and certainty over the future funding arrangements. Without this we could see rough sleepers ending up back on the streets.”\nThey added: “When this crisis is over, we cannot return to business as usual. Rough sleepers, some of whom are receiving support for the first time, have been brought safely off the streets. We cannot let that progress go to waste.\n“This is an unprecedented opportunity to ‘build back better’ and avoid a return to business as usual. If the government is serious about its commitment to end rough sleeping, now is the time to act.”\nThe statement was also signed by Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London; Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester; Steve Rotheram, Mayor of Liverpool City Region, and Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region.\nThe Government launched the emergency funding in March, in an effort to get every rough sleeper off the street so they could self-isolate to reduce the spread of Covid-19.\nAnd it temporarily changed the rules so that councils could house people classed as having “no recourse to public funds”.\nThis generally means their leave to enter or remain in the UK is conditional, or they donot have leave to enter or remain.\nOfficial figures put the number of rough sleepers in the North East at 67 last year. This is based on a count of rough sleepers organised by local authorities, and it’s generally accepted that the true figure is likely to be higher.\nThe Government has denied reports that the emergency funding is due to come to an end. However, it’s also declined to say whether more money will be made available.\nThe Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government points out that it had already committed £489 million in 2020 to 2021 to help rough sleepers, a £121 million increase in funding from the previous year.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry said: “Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street, backed by an unprecedented continued package of government support.\n“We have been clear councils must continue to provide safe accommodation for those that need it and provided £3.2m at the start of the pandemic so they could take immediate action and help rough sleepers off the street.\n“Our new rough sleeping taskforce – spearheaded by Dame Louise Casey – will work with councils across the country to ensure as many rough sleepers as possible can move into long-term, safe accommodation.”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_when-is-an-advert-not-an-advert/content_277.html": "When is an Advert Not an Advert?\nDecember 18, 2022\nI have to admit, apart from the odd England games, I don’t really watch TV. Not because of some philosophical objection, I just don’t have the time. Between being the Mayor and spending time with my family, there’s little room left to watch failed politicians eating parts of animals that really shouldn’t be eaten…\nHowever, I did catch this year’s John Lewis advert. Beamed into homes across the country, it’s an annual cultural event that’s woven itself into the tapestry of modern Christmas traditions. In previous years this 90 second clip is rumoured to have cost north of £1 million to make. The Blair Witch Project cost around £50k, although it is not quite as heart-warming.\nThe advert is a simply told story about one middle-aged man’s attempt to connect with his incoming foster child, via the medium of skateboarding. As the advert finishes, a graphic on screen tells us there are over 108,000 children in the UK care system, and that John Lewis is making a long-term commitment to support them. Like most people, I’m left thinking about the challenges those young people will face as they grow up. My thoughts then turn to all the wonderful foster parents who’ll support them on their journey. Strangely, the last thing on my mind at this point is whether I need a new toaster.\nSo what are John Lewis up to? Have they given up on trying to sell us matching duvet and pillow sets and turned their attention to sorting out society’s problems instead? (Full disclosure: our matching duvet and pillow cases are from John Lewis.)\nThey wouldn’t be the first company to make a bold statement in this space. On Black Friday 2011, outdoor clothing company Patagonia famously took out an advert in the New York Times instructing people – “Don’t buy this jacket”. Going on to explain the environmental costs of clothing production and needless consumption.\nFor the record I think both Patagonia and John Lewis should be applauded for highlighting important social issues. Sadly, in the world of big global brands, they are the exception, not the rule. This Christmas, adverts will constantly tell us that ‘we’re worth it’ and we should ‘treat ourselves’ to that shiny new thing.\nWorse still, marketeers will subliminally remind us that when it comes to family and friends, more money spent = more love shown. These messages feel even more jarring when you’re struggling to pay for the basics.\nThis Christmas will be the toughest part of an already tough year for many people. The North East has overtaken London with the highest rate of child poverty in the UK. In-work poverty contributes to this rise. Caught in the jaws of a cost-of-living crisis, we are getting squeezed from all angles. With the added pressure of presents to buy, big meals to cook and homes to heat, many of us definitely don’t wish it could be Christmas every day.\nAt the North of Tyne, we’re doing what we can to address this, including our Child Poverty Prevention Programme. We’re working with schools to deliver welfare advice to parents at the school gates. Because of this intervention one parent in North Tyneside was able to access a further £414 per month of welfare support that was owed to them. Other families have had £8,000 and £11,000 in backdated money they didn’t realise they were owed. That amount of money is life changing when you’re on the knife-edge of poverty, choosing between heating and eating.\nBut the truth is we can only do so much. We need Government to stop sitting on their hands and step-up with a bold plan to bring down energy bills, pay public sector workers properly and kick start our economy by investing in green jobs.\nFor all the good that responsible corporations do, we cannot rely on private sector philanthropy. The Victorians tried this. Spoiler alert: it didn’t work! Eventually we realised the only way to support and nourish our society was through a modern welfare state. Then, as now, it required working people to come together and organise for fair pay and safe work.\nThis Christmas we don’t just need corporate social responsibility, we need government social responsibility.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_how-do-i-get-things-done-i-find-a-way/content_260.html": "How Do I Get Things Done? I Find a Way\nJanuary 29, 2023\nAs a politician I’m often asked how things get done. My job as Mayor isn’t to debate policy or score points with political opponents, it’s about bringing people together to get things done.\nSo when I see pictures of myself digging up some earth for Transmission Dynamics’ new factory, or cutting a ribbon in Verisure’s new offices for 600 people, or handing a certificate to a school student for their success in our climate education programme, it’s always slightly surreal. Thankfully my kids’ sarcastic wit is only too good at bringing me back down to earth when I get home!\nYou’ve probably seen pictures of me and my fellow regional leaders signing the new expanded devolution deal for the North East. It’s been years in the making, and I’m over the moon that it’s worth so much more than other English devolution deals. £38 million for West Yorkshire, £38m for West Midlands, £30m for Manchester. We’ve negotiated £48m for the North East. And that’s just the core investment budget.\nIncluding transport, housing and adult education, it’s £1 billion in the first three years. And that will increase. This month alone our North of Tyne team has secured an additional £4.2 million we’re using to provide free training courses, and over £15 million for investment across the North East on port infrastructure, creative industries, and housing.\nLike the rest of Britain, austerity has wreaked havoc here. Our public services are crying out for investment and fair wage settlements. I work closely with the other mayors – there’s unity in strength. But my job is to represent the people who elected me, here. I said in my manifesto I’d try to bring the North East together so we could get transport devolved, and we’re one step closer.\nCloser – the deal signing with Michael Gove fixed the contents of the deal, but the public and our councils now get their say – check the council websites. Journalists keep asking me if I’m interested in continuing as Mayor, over the new, larger area. Yes I am, but it’s inappropriate to launch a campaign before we know the results of the public consultation.\nGetting this far has been far from plain sailing, mind. Last year saw a dizzying merry-go-round of Ministers and Prime Ministers in Whitehall – I’ve had colds that lasted longer than some of ‘em!\nI recall the Thursday when Boris Johnson (remember him?) resigned last July, I was in London. By the Saturday morning I was speaking to Greg Clark, the incoming Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities, making sure our devolution deal didn’t get shelved in all the chaos.\nOur council leaders must have lost count of the hours of meetings and discussions they’ve had to get this far. We’ve collectively met with Michael Gove (sacked & reappointed), and before him Neil O’Brien (resigned) and before him Luke Hall (dropped in reshuffle). Newcastle leader Nick Kemp was adamant that we must have a stronger settlement if Durham were to join the deal – out of which we secured Trailblazer status.\nI’ve lost count of the meetings I’ve had with Treasury ministers and Transport ministers to ratchet up the amount of funding we’re getting. And with Education ministers to get child poverty prevention in the deal. None of that gets reported – there will never be a headline “Politicians inch closer to agreement in technical meeting about obscure funding streams”. Sometimes it means getting in a room with someone you fundamentally disagree with on 80% of things, just to find the 20% of common ground that unlocks a solution.\nAnd of course, the politicians are in the photos, but there’s a team of people behind us. My North of Tyne team have been exemplary – helping deliver so much already in my first term, in spite of the Covid pandemic. Reams of documents, folders of spreadsheets – reality is so different from political TV shows.\nIn this role you don’t have the luxury of walking away from negotiations, you have to find solutions. If you don’t solve the problems, the public will rightly punish you for it.\nSo, when I’m asked ‘how do I get things done?’ The answer is simple: I find a way.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_are-all-politicians-the-same/content_195.html": "Are all politicians the same?\nJune 11, 2023\nAre all politicians the same?\nBoris Johnson has finally gone. Jumped before he was pushed. He’s one of the few politicians you can call a liar without fear of litigation. A fact I pointed out on national television a few weeks back.\nIt was blindingly obvious to everyone that he was covering up Partygate from the start. He has lied to former employers, MPs, and, of course, the public. And, it is alleged, the Queen, about proroguing Parliament. And his former party leader about his extra-martial affairs.\nThe real question shouldn’t be “did he lie?” but “how did he get away with it for so long?”\nAnd here’s the answer: because other people enabled him. His lies were useful to them. He had undoubted talent for brazenly pushing through any credibility barrier. While he spoke about levelling up and global Britain and 40 new hospitals, we’ve faced a cost of living crisis, rampant inflation and an NHS where people with a stroke or chest pains have to wait hours for an ambulance.\nIn the same week, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas announced she’s stepping down. Her book, “Honourable Friends?” shines a light on the culture of dishonesty and soft corruption in British politics.\nSome have said the real aim with post-truth politics is to muddy the waters so the public believe no one. Then the loudest voice with the deepest pockets wins every argument. Don’t fall for it. Caroline Lucas has proven that all politicians are NOT the same.\nIt won’t have escaped your notice that Labour Party HQ in London has blocked members in the North East from voting for me.\nOriginally they briefed that it was for talking to film maker Ken Loach at a cultural event. They changed tack when it was pointed out that Keir Starmer shared a platform with Ken Loach. And appeared in one of his films, McLibel. And the BBC co-funded his latest film. Oops.\nNow the line is “we just want the best candidate”. So why not let members in the North East decide that? You’d think that being a Metro Mayor might qualify me for a longlist. People from across the political divide have said I’ve done a good job.\nShadow minister Jenny Chapman is one of Keir Starmer’s closest allies. She confirmed the real reason on BBC Politics North. “It is right,” she said, “that the party leadership, involving the leader of the party, but also other figures who lead the party on the NEC get to make these kinds of decisions and then the party membership from across the North East get to choose from that list.”\nSo there you go. Labour HQ has a preferred candidate. Democracy is not important. It’s worth watching the full piece on iPlayer, or my social media. Labour members have been threatened with disciplinary action if they even discuss it in meetings, leading to votes in protest, and even a walkout. Let’s get it on record that it’s not the North East members of the Labour Party who’ve taken or condoned this action.\nLabour’s national executive committee can change their minds at any point and start the process again.\nBut so what if I’m not allowed to stand for Labour? In the grand scheme of things, that scarcely matters. Because here’s the thing. This isn’t about me. It’s about you.\nDevolution means letting people outside London make these decisions. The whole point of devolved Metro Mayors is that people who live in a region get to decide what happens there.\nThe people in the Westminster bubble think they know what’s better for the North East than you do. They think your judgement is inferior to theirs.\nThis week Labour HQ has u-turned on its £28bn a year investment plan to decarbonise Britain. That includes insulating homes to be energy efficient. Generating renewable energy to bring down bills. Building a better public transport system. That makes a difference to real life – not just politics. If Labour was in government, I’d put region above party, whoever was leader. And Labour HQ knows that, which is why they did not trust members with a free choice of candidate.\nNot all politicians are the same.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_hustings-aiming-for-a-0-0-draw/content_50.html": "Hustings – aiming for a 0-0 draw\nJune 27, 2024\nLast night I went to Trinity Church in Gosforth. Not because of some sudden religious impulse, but to watch the general election hustings for Newcastle North. The topics were public transport and climate change.\nIt’s a novel experience for me to be an observer at these things. If I’m not on the stage, I’ve usually been coaching or supporting one of the people who is. But this time, I genuinely wanted to gauge the calibre of the seven people who want to represent me in Parliament. Four points stood out.\nFirstly, Labour’s Catherine McKinnell, Conservative Guy Renner Thompson, and Reform’s Deborah Lorraine were invited but didn’t show up. That’s pretty contemptible. You want to pass laws that affect me, but can’t even muster the energy to speak to voters and journalists in the middle of an election. None of the three had said they had an emergency. Imagine applying for a £93,000 job and not even attending the interview. That said, given the track record of Labour, Tories and Reform, it’s questionable how honest the answers would have been anyway.\nSecondly, the four that did attend all seemed to be pretty genuine people.\nMartin Everson, retired archaeologist, standing for the SDP. It does have a link to the old SDP of David Owens and Shirley Williams, but these days is UKIP Lite. Anti-immigration, climate deniers, protectionist. But without the nasty edge you get hanging round Reform. Every answer circled back to archaeology. Or palaeoarchaeology. At one point we got onto Norse settlements in Newfoundland. His most interesting answer: his favourite flavour of crisps is the ones with the little blue bag of salt. That’s one thing I can agree with.\nKing Teare, PhD student in democratic engagement. Dressed in a big yellow robe and sporting a crown, in an ironic statement on democracy. His answers all referred to democratic deficit. Fair point, but you can’t just say, “I’ll ask the public” for every answer. Representative democracy requires preparation and knowledge. You have to lead as well as listen.\nAiden King, doctor and former Lib Dem Mayoral candidate. I was truly shocked when asked about renewable energy he didn’t mention his plan to build a giant windfarm.\nSarah Peters for the Green Party, another doctor, managed to be accurate and relevant at times. On several occasions she actually answered the question the panel were asked. Although to be fair to the others, this was a home game for her.\nThirdly, the standard of answers was mostly awful. Now, that’s probably a bit harsh, since I’m someone who writes books on policy proposals and economic analysis for fun. And being eloquent under pressure is not easy. But these are not random people in a pub quiz, they want to make our laws and spend our money.\nTheir opening statements were stream of consciousness, full of umms and aahs, and couldn’t keep to time. Aiden King literally stopped mid-sentence “and in Ukraine specific…” What that had to do with public transport I have no idea.\nAfterwards, As Leon, my 18 year old who’s voting in his first general election said, “Well, that was entertaining in ways it probably shouldn’t have been.”\nMost answers were cliché heavy. “This is really important. That needs fixing. We must stop the other.” Big wish lists, basically. No plans for how to deliver it, what the challenges would be, and how to overcome them. In their defence, they were all substantially better than Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, the current and next Prime Ministers. At least these four told the truth and behaved with dignity.\nIt wasn’t that what they said was bad. Well, some of it was. Martin Everson answered a question about oil drilling in the North Sea by saying he used to watch the Good Life and wanted to own cows.\nIt was what wasn’t said. The climate emergency is on course to decimate the global economy and force the migration of over a billion people. As Caroline, my wife said, “Where was the emotion?”\nThere was no passion. Probably not because they don’t care. I’m sure they do. But because Britain’s political discourse is insipid. There are no great orators to rouse the heart. No insightful thinkers to stimulate the imagination. Our national leaders go into debates hoping to get a 0-0 draw. Default behaviour is stick to your party line like it’s a life buoy in a storm.\nFourth, and finally, the real issue wasn’t mentioned all night. System change. Everyone, Green candidate included, accepted the default framing. That dealing with the climate emergency is a trade off between how much we spend, and who pays for it. But this is not a zero-sum game. It’s cheaper to fix it than to ignore it. That means ending the rentier economy. Where our society is geared up to making very rich people even richer, and some wealth trickles down. And our political and journalistic class enable the status quo, or are court jesters acting as a safety valve. There are some notable exceptions that prove the rule.\nKing Teare made the last closing statement. At the end of this speech, he paused, thought, and spoke from the heart. “The problem with political parties, is all you get is groupthink.” Right at the end, the most insightful thing anyone said all night.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_ive-got-two-new-kids-apparently/content_132.html": "I’ve Got Two New Kids, Apparently\nDecember 8, 2019\n“Do you have another two kids you haven’t told me about?” laughed my wife.\n“Eh?”\nShe explained, “It says on Wikipedia we have four children.”\nA more interesting question might be why she was looking me up on Wikipedia while I was sitting next to her in the living room.\nThe article was neutral – it doesn’t harm my reputation whether we have two kids or four. In addition to giving me an extra two kids, Wikipedia also got my year and place of birth wrong, my number of siblings, and a number of career details. In its defence, it is a volunteer run project.\nTruth is the first casualty of war, it’s said, and that’s what elections are.\nLast week, the Chronicle ran a headline claiming the North of Tyne staff budget had a £78,000 overspend. It hasn’t, it’s £113,000 under, but a rebuttal only appears in a quote six paragraphs down, and judging by the comments and social media responses, very few people read that far into an article. A headline can travel half way around the world while the body text is putting on its shoes.\nThere’s a cheap shot from a political opponent claiming we’ve achieved nothing, despite the evidence that we’ve set up programmes creating 1,152 jobs.\nIt says Andy Burnham is the highest paid Metro Mayor on £110,000. He’s not, it’s Sadiq Khan on £152,734. (Not the £143,911 Wikipedia says.) That’s not biased, but it is untrue.\nPerhaps truth is not the objective: should our media be there to foster debate instead? Give politicians equal space to say whatever they like, where truth is optional, and let the people judge? It’s a valid question. But is that not what opinion columns are for?\nEvidence based debate over public policy is a rare beast. Even articles based on academic reports rarely include the links to the underlying evidence. Think about the Brexit reporting over the past three years. It’s all “Brexit is an opportunity!” or “Brexit will crash the economy!” Likewise NHS cuts, tax rates or police numbers.\nMind you, the fact that Chancellor Sajid Javid refused to commission an economic impact analysis on his government’s Hard Brexit plan could be to blame. A government that is afraid to let its people judge the evidence in public debate is a government that is afraid of its people.\nBut where was the outcry? Why weren’t business newspapers and broadsheets alike clamouring for the evidence? Is the economic impact assessment of Brexit not vital for national decision making?\nWhere else shall we find our facts? Social media? 250 Facebook employees have signed a letter this week, outraged at the company’s policy to exempt paid political ads from fact checking. Given how easy it to spin a story, the very least we can expect is that direct lies are banned. But no, cash is king. In the scramble for clicks, advertising revenue depends upon impact.\nI can understand why a politician or celebrity might lie about their drug use, or bizarre initiation rites involving pigs heads and private parts. Maybe these are personal matters that justify privacy. Most people would rather deny a hard truth than face it.\nBut our current Prime Minister has serious form.\nFor me, one incident sums up Mr Johnson. In May this year he tweeted “I’ve just voted Conservative in the local elections.” Someone quickly pointed out there were no local elections where he lived, and he deleted the tweet. Busted. But why lie over something so trivial? Unless you don’t value the truth as something precious in its own right.\nDemocracy is hard work. It requires citizens willing to sift the true from the false, the profound from the trivial, the substance from the headline. I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday November the 4th 2019.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_weathercocks-and-signposts/content_57.html": "Weathercocks and Signposts\nDecember 21, 2018\nNormally what happens to politicians is the closer they get to the levers of power, the more attention they get from the establishment.\nSitting in board meetings, appointments with corporate lobbyists, calls from government officials take up a bigger and bigger part of their calendar. All of these people who court them are well informed, and very plausible. They use terms like “inclusive growth” and “economic vision”. But these are slippery terms that hide the truth: power and wealth still concentrated with the wealthy, and still guarded by the establishment.\nSome politicians develop their own convictions. Others who stepped up from a general belief in social good find themselves absorbing establishment ideas by osmosis. It’s a slow, subtle shift. They lose touch with their roots, and start to regard party members asking questions as trouble causers. They never really saw the world in terms of class analysis: who has the power and wealth, and how to they use it. They never really understood the difference between socialism and capitalism.\nAnd so their political compass drifts towards centrism. They turn into “adjective politicians”. Every speech is loaded with words like”compassionate” “stronger” “inclusive””visionary”. But once you pass their media coaching, you realise they intend to change nothing. They have become glossy state-sponsored managers.\nJeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell bypassed this route. They had fully formed ideas about real democratic involvement and democratising the economy. They got just as much attention from the establishment, but it wasn’t cosy wooing, it was outright hostility. Media lies, orchestrated attacks from the careerists on their own side, and even state funded social media slurs. The same will happen to me if I’m elected Mayor.\nDon’t worry – like Jeremy and John, I come from a place of profound understanding that society needs radical change in ownership and power, and not just a coat of compassion-coloured gloss paint. If I’m elected, I will put my manifesto into practice.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-work-is-not-best-done-by-us-sitting-in-westminster/content_118.html": "“The work is not best done by us sitting in Westminster”\nNovember 26, 2023\n“We wanted to make a statement. And we did.”\nImpressive if you’ve just beaten a rival football club. Less impressive if you’re the Chancellor and that’s a literal description of what you’ve just done.\nAnyone expecting fireworks from the Autumn Statement hasn’t been paying attention to Mr Sunak’s Government over the past year. Since taking the highest political office in the land, the current Prime Minister has not prioritised the cost-of-living crisis or tackling the climate emergency. In fact, quite the opposite.\nThe North East didn’t get a mention in the Chancellor’s speech. But it did feature twice in the 120-page document that accompanied it – the North East Investment Zones, and the North East Trailblazer.\nIt’s standard but tedious form in the Westminster pantomime for Ministers and Shadows to crowbar in praise for party allies. Some might day it’s an undemocratic use of office. But what really matters is the policy decisions.\nOur Investment Zone is now officially confirmed. We’ve been working on it since the Truss Government first floated the idea of race-to-the-bottom tax-cutting, deregulated free-for-all zones. To be fair, as soon as I pushed back, they did listen. We’re getting an extra £160 million over ten years to boost local skills and infrastructure in Blyth, along the Tyne, at IAMP in Washington, and NETPark in Sedgefield. That translates into more well-paid jobs.\nI’m a firm believer that if everyone has a secure, well-paid job, half our other social problems will disappear, reducing pressure on health, social services, benefits and criminal justice.\nThat businesses need long-term stability is a truism. So do charities, community organisations, and the public sector. Stop-start funding invites rushed plans and unstable delivery. Across the country 43% of last year’s Shared Prosperity Fund money was not spent. The main reason was that councils were given as little as two months to spend it.\nWhen we’re given a long-term settlement we spend it wisely. The Adult Skills Budget was devolved to the North of Tyne in 2020. Training chefs, welders, fork-lift drivers – the actual people who are our wealth creators. Since taking control from Whitehall, we’ve increased enrolments from 21,885 a year to 32,769 – for the same budget. We achieved this 50% increase in value for money by working with employers, training providers, and crucially, the learners.\nOur track record is one reason we’ve landed the best-funded devolution deal in the country. From May we’ll get more money in our annual investment fund than Greater Manchester, the West Midlands or anywhere else in England, despite their greater populations.\nDevolution means more flexibility, and better results. Tying us up with inflexible red tape doesn’t. This is where a Trailblazer comes in. It means we can set more of the rules about how we spend the money. Projects we fund, from training providers to community groups get long-term, stable funding agreements without stop-start cash flow or incessant bid writing.\nI first spoke to Government about it in January 2022, before they’d even published the idea as policy. They agreed in principle last Autumn. I fought to stop it getting kicked into the long grass. But shy bairns get nowt, and the published Autumn Statement confirms that we’ll get our bespoke North East Trailblazer from spring next year, ahead of other areas.\nSo lobbying, haggling and building on a solid track record has landed us something significant. Just as well, because there’s little else to help the 7.7 million people waiting for NHS treatment. Or the 1 million children living in destitution. You can’t build a strong economy for the future when children are going hungry or trying to do homework without Wi-Fi. You can’t build a strong economy today when millions are off work sick.\nType in “chancellors.autumn.statement” on the global mapping website ‘What3Words’ and you’re sent to a 3 by 3 metre square in the middle of the Kenyan desert. 4,000 miles away from the North East seems an appropriate metaphor for how well Westminster understands us.\nWhen the Chancellor said, “the work is not done,” he was right. It would be more accurate to say “the work is not best done by us sitting in Westminster”. Now that really would be an honest statement.",

But for every high-profile policy announcement, there’s two dozen fringe events spread across Brighton, a hundred private meetings huddled around tables in hotel bars, and politicians and advisors scurrying around finishing speeches on a just-in-time basis.\nConference is always bustling, but the expectation of a general election added an extra spark. Chance encounters in the lift, handshakes in the lobby, catching people in the breakfast room. Late night conversations and early breakfast meetings.\nLabour has long had a commitment to devolving powers and funding to English regions, and so with a General Election imminent, my team had set up a series of meetings with shadow ministers, advisors and other Mayors to discuss details.\nThe previous Friday, in Rotherham, Boris Johnson had offered me and the other Metro Mayors additional devolved powers. Readers will be wholly unsurprised to learn that my opinion of our Prime Minister is not high. As a matter of personal philosophy I’m always polite; insults say more about the insulter than the insulted. So I’ll simply say that questions remain unanswered about how Mr Johnson intends to deliver on his promises. But an offer is an offer, and it’s my job to secure the best deal I can for the people North of the Tyne.\nIt’s not just politicians at party conferences – I discussed economic growth with business leaders, devolution with the transport industry, green energy with the offshore sector, community development with co-op specialists, and I spoke at half-a-dozen think-tank events.\nAn emerging theme is the regeneration of Northern towns. Everyone recognises the problems of regional wealth inequality. Not so easily explained is the wealth difference between the affluent market towns, and the former industrial towns.\nIt’s as much about assets as jobs. Money flows into the wealthier towns, not because they have photogenic castles and walls, but because they are attractive places to live for people with significant private assets.\nThere’s been generations of landowners, people who are privately wealthy from shares, and people with large pensions. Combined, that keeps enough money flowing into a town to make its economy buoyant and keep house prices high. There’s a virtuous circle that supports the boutique stores, the independent cafes, and creates enough appeal for a professional services like estate agents, lawyers and vets to locate in these towns.\nContrast that with former industrial towns, where the population never held many assets. Industries were closed without any just transition, whole towns experienced brutal economic shock. These industries were wealth creators, but the assets and profits they created were never owned by the workers who did the mining or the welding or who staffed the production lines. All too often, they have nothing left but the chronic diseases from a lifetime of hard graft. The solution has to include developing small businesses and community owned assets.\nOn Tuesday morning, news came through that the court of appeal had confirmed that Boris Johnson had hit a new low: the proroguing of Parliament was indeed illegal, and Parliament was recalled. Two hundred MPs and assorted staff hurriedly recast diaries, rescheduled meetings, and re-booked trains.\nJeremy Corbyn’s speech was brought forward a day. Commentators across the board regarded it as his best and most confident – and why wouldn’t it be? He’s in striking distance of Number 10.\nThe next morning, the hotel breakfast room was like the Marie Celeste; the MPs and spads had disappeared.\nThis Monday I’m in Manchester, for a meeting of the M9, the enigmatic name given to the meeting of me and the other 8 Metro Mayors. We’d agreed to have it in Manchester at the same time as Tory conference, so we could collar some government ministers.

Last week, Durham County Council voted to pursue devolution. Constitutional change probably isn’t top of many Christmas lists. But over £4,000,000,000 of public investment for the North East is top of mine.\nThat’s what the deal is worth – over £4 billion. The headline figure is impressive. Hopefully the full details will be cleared for announcement soon. But since people are already discussing it on social media, it’s worth clarifying what a devolution deal is – and isn’t.\nIn May 2019, I was elected as the first ever mayor of the North of Tyne Combined Authority. The three Local Authorities (councils) of Northumberland, North Tyneside and Newcastle kept their independence, and gained new money and powers overseen by a mayor (me).\nAll the new money and powers come from Westminster and Whitehall. None of it comes from our councils. Local councillors have exactly the same control as before. Decisions on planning applications, on council tax, on taxi regulations. Your council still empties the bins, looks after children in care, and a hundred other things.\nWhat did get devolved was an investment fund to boost our regional economy. We’ve created 4,600 jobs with it (and rising), and protected another 2,700 that were at risk. That’s a huge difference to 7,300 families.\nRegular readers will know about our Child Poverty Prevention work in schools. Our Brownfield Housing programme. Our schools climate change education. Our small business growth programmes. Our Green New Deal. Our Good Work Pledge. Our North of Tyne Crowdfunder. If you re-elect me in May 2024, when my current term ends and the new authority begins, we’ll deliver all these great programmes across the whole region.\nThe North of Tyne also runs “post-19 adult education” – vocational training for chefs, welders, computer skills. 22,000 people a year were trained before devolution. Now it’s 33,000. For the same budget. A 50% increase in value for money, and an extra 11,000 people’s livelihoods boosted. We run courses how and where they’re needed, instead of a one-size-fits-all model from London.\nThe new, expanded deal adds South Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham. It’s still a “minded to” deal – each council has yet to make its formal decision – that’s how democracy works. I’ve been working on this deal since I was elected, and our council leaders and teams have all helped shape it.\nThe new authority gets the North of Tyne investment scaled up to match the new, larger, population. It’s the largest devolved investment fund in England.\nWe’ll get control of bus services – with joint ticketing. £millions in new transport investment to improve services and build infrastructure. Our northern transport network is a national disgrace. People struggle getting to work and kids struggle getting to school. The ability to fix this ourselves is a big deal.\nPolice, the NHS, and Fire and Rescue won’t come under the new Combined Authority. Their governance remains unchanged.\nI can’t give more details until we have official clearance. So what isn’t it?\nIt isn’t a new layer of government. The seven council areas elect 526 councillors, two police and crime commissioners, and 22 MPs. That’s whether we have devolution or not.\nIt’s not a gravy train – there is no Mayoral limo. I claim £0 in expenses. I decline all offers of free tickets to sport and cultural events. That’s just my personal policy, mind – I can’t speak for other politicians.\nNone of the new money comes from your council tax. My staff do work previously done by central government. We’re a net wealth generator. Every £1 invested from our investment fund returns over £3 to Treasury in payroll taxes alone. We save the taxpayer money.\nIt doesn’t concentrate power in one person’s hands. Combined Authority Mayors can’t choose their cabinet members. It’s automatically the leaders and deputies of the Local Authorities, who get to vote on spending decisions. Contrast that with a Prime Minister, or Local Authority leaders, who personally appoint their cabinets.\nThe devolution deal won’t fix the Ukraine war or raging inflation.

Hot metals. Open flames.\nYes, I’m talking about Pancake Day. Barring Christmas, this is THE cultural festival of the year in the Driscoll household. With the passing years, and to satisfy the insatiable appetites and stratospherically high expectations of two, ever-growing teenage boys, I’ve had to become something of a pro when it comes to crepes. Pancakes are their go-to choice when it comes to birthday breakfasts too. And, as a socialist who believes in the redistribution of power, wealth, and transparency in government, I feel compelled to share my secrets. So, read on…\nFirst, make the mix. Grab a large blender. Or a mixing bowl will do. For a double portion, in goes:\nA pint of milk.\nThree medium to large eggs. Cracked one handed for extra flair.\n8oz of plain flour. Or 225g in new money.\n“What about the salt?” you may ask. Nope. No salt. Trust me on this.\nGive it a good blitz. And remember to put the lid on. And don’t confuse 4oz for 40z as my kids did a couple of years back. By the time we’d added extra milk to turn the concrete to liquid again, it meant toad in the hole for a week.\nFrying pan. You can’t beat a good non-stick one. If you’ve got more than one, keep it just for pancakes, eggs and omelettes. On the hob. Heat right up. Hot enough so if you flick water at the base the droplets immediately sizzle and evaporate. A big slug of sunflower oil. Not olive oil, the smoke point is too low. And you might not appreciate the taste of tapenade with chocolate spread. Roll the oil around the pan to coat it evenly.\nIn goes a ladleful of pancake mix. Lift the pan an inch off the hob and swirl the mix so it’s evenly spread. Then – and this is key – leave it alone for a minute. Until you can see bubbles, under the surface. That’s when you know it’s got the integrity to take it to the next level… the flip.\nAfter years of circular stains on the ceiling and a few minor burns from splashed oil, I reckon I’ve mastered the pancake flip. (Don’t believe me? Check out the slow-mo video on my Facebook page).\nThe trick is, you see, not to swing the pan up. No sir. It’s to thrust the pan forwards and then whip it back, with a sudden flick. You want a low, 180-degree spin, close to the pan; not a 720, three feet up in the air. Remember: you’re making pancakes, not launching a satellite.\nEt voila. Come about 7pm on any given Shrove Tuesday and I have a steady production line going. Flip. Cook. Serve son. Cook. Flip. Cook. Serve other son. Flip. Cook. Serve my wife. Rinse and repeat. I eat last. If I’m lucky.\nThis year my double portion mix wasn’t enough. I had to make a second batch. In total, two pints of milk. A pound of flour. And a box of eggs.\nNow for the controversial part. Toppings.\nBirthday pancakes are served with a Suzette sauce: butter, caramelised sugar, orange juice & zest, and Cointreau. Flambéed. Delicious.\nOn Tuesday, Leon, my eldest son went for peanut butter all the way. Caroline, salmon and mango chutney. Surprisingly tasty.\nMy youngest son Nelson enjoys Nutella and Peanut Butter. On the same pancake. Followed by feta cheese and tomato puree. Each to their own.\nTo be fair, that’s not the strangest topping I’ve heard. Chilli. Pomegranate seeds? Tuna mayo?? Prawns with hummus???\nAs a Labour Mayor who’s had to work with a Tory Government to secure a £4.27 billion devolution deal, I’ve had to reconcile a lot of differences of opinion, but I think that one goes too far even for me.\nSo what’s your favourite? Tell me on my social media, or in person at my next Mayor’s Question Time on Thursday, 16th March. 6:30pm, at the Carnegie Building in Benwell. NE4 8XS.\nAccording Thérèse Coffey MP, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, you should learn to cherish turnip. Where’s Baldric when you need him?",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_downing-street-is-a-moral-cesspit/content_214.html": "Downing Street is a Moral Cesspit\nMay 2, 2021\nThere’s something rotten in the state of Britain.\nIn 1963, Cabinet Minister John Profumo resigned after lying about an extra-marital affair with Christine Keeler. That was sleaze.\nI agree with former Tory Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who said about Coalition minister Chris Huhne’s affair, “What goes on in people’s private lives is a subject that fascinates the tabloid press but is irrelevant to the job they are trying to do.” Mind you, that was before Huhne was imprisoned for perverting the course of justice.\nWhat we’re seeing now goes far beyond sleaze. We’re witnessing an executive spiralling out of control.\nWe’re grown-ups. We know relationships sometimes break up. No one should be stigmatised for that. But our Prime Minister has a serial history of getting women pregnant while he’s married to someone else. The failure to manage contraception is worrying trait for someone with his finger on the nuclear button.\nWhich takes us to Jennifer Arcuri, one of his girlfriends while married to his second wife. Johnson denied the affair. She admitted it. He spent taxpayer money taking her on three top-level trade missions, despite her businesses not meeting the criteria.\nWallpapergate and Cash-for-Curtains are not matters of taste. Frankly, I don’t give a damn about snobbery over the “John Lewis furniture nightmare.” My wife and I had our wedding list there. But I literally cannot imagine paying £840 for a roll of wallpaper. The failure to redecorate a flat within the £30,000 taxpayer funded budget is shocking. Johnson is the First Lord of the Treasury. He is ultimately in charge of our public finances.\nThis is about whether he’s broken the law. Did he fail to declare a donation of £58,000? He says he’s repaid the money now. But it’s no defence in law to say, “I gave it back after I was caught”.\nThere’s his undeclared conversations about sorting out a billionaire’s “tax problems”. Imagine being able to text the PM to “sort out” your tax bill.\nHis ravenous pursuit of all seven deadly sins sets the tone for this government.\nDavid Cameron – another former Bullingdon Boy – is up to his eyes in a financial scandal “as close to fraud as you could imagine”. Cameron stood to make £60 million. Rishi Sunak has questions to answer. We taxpayers may get stung for £5 billion! Greensill also offered nurses pay-day loans, profiting by packaging them up into securities, just like the sub-prime mortgages that caused the financial crash. The last thing NHS workers need is more debt. They deserve a pay rise!\nMatt Hancock’s implicated with VIP lanes. He owns shares in his sister’s waste disposal company, Topwood Limited. Topwood was awarded a Framework Deal to provide NHS services just months after he became Health Secretary in July 2018.\nSecretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick, secured a £12,000 donation from billionaire pornographer Richard Desmond. This was, of course, nothing to do with Jenrick’s personal intervention to rush through a planning deal so Desmond could dodge an infrastructure levy bill of £45 million from Tower Hamlets council. After all, if you were taking a back-hander to let someone off £45m, you’d want more than 12 grand.\nRemember Hanbury? The lobbying firm run by Dominic Cummings’s mates, handed £900,000 for opinion polling on the pandemic. Remember Ayanda, the company linked to Liz Truss, fast tracked through VIP lanes, who supplied £155 million worth of unusable face masks for NHS frontline staff? Remember Alex Bourne, who ran Hancock’s local pub? Who despite having no prior experience, was given an NHS contract worth £millions after sending Hancock a WhatsApp message. I could go on, but there’s a word limit on this column.\nA report into racism has been condemned for misrepresenting the experts it quoted. Sir Alex Allan, the PM’s advisor on ministerial standards resigned after Priti Patel’s bullying. Dominic Cummings, Lee Cain, a whole cascade of advisors resigning and turning against Johnson. It’s less like Hamlet and more like the final act of Macbeth, with the crazed ruler off the leash, deserted by his lackies, indulging in angry tirades to “let the bodies pile high in their thousands” and then actually letting the bodies pile high in their thousands. If we see any losses for the Tories next week, the sharks will circle for a leadership bid.\nJohnson’s biggest mistake is believing voters have “priced in” his immorality. That he’s “non-stick”. Here’s another metaphor for you: the straw that broke the camel’s back.\nWhen Tory stalwarts like the Daily Telegraph’s Peter Oborne say, “Downing Street has become a moral cesspit” and Boris Johnson is “proven to be a repeated and habitual liar”, we know the Rubicon has been crossed.\nI don’t believe for a second that every Tory politician is sleazy or every Labour politician is a saint. When you’re casting your vote on Thursday, ignore the hype. Look at values. Look at policies. Look at integrity. Ask your candidates on social media: will they condemn the sleaze that is rotting inside our national government?\nOriginally Published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 3 May 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_our-people-are-the-norths-true-powerhouse/content_249.html": "Our People are the North’s True Powerhouse\nJuly 4, 2021\nThere’s a lack of trust between the people and power.\nFor decades, this has been reflected in Whitehall’s top-down approach to the North East and the other English regions. Decisions on infrastructure to education to health are made by people without frontline experience, who don’t live here. The result? A huge imbalance of power, wealth and health across England. GDP per capita in the North East is just 73% of the UK average, down from 93% in 1981. Centralised decision making means less money in your pocket.\nA national one-size-fits-all policy affects our public services, our transport, our job prospects and even our life spans. It translates into us being top of every league table you don’t want to lead. Lowest business density. Low productivity. Child poverty up from a shocking 26% in 2014 to a harrowing 37% in 2020. The 51 central government initiatives to restore regional growth since 1981 have been diktats from the top and haven’t worked.\nWe’ll only transform the fortunes of the North East by recognising our people are the North’s true powerhouse and our diversity is our strength. Having an elected mayor with devolved powers gives us the tools to do this. Claiming it’s another tier of government is a lazy argument. Evidence proves we’re fast, efficient and effective, creating jobs over target and under budget. Taking the reins from Whitehall is the way to build a strong, vibrant and sustainable North East. And it allows a new approach to democracy. One where people are trusted, their voices heard, where they shape public policy making in a meaningful way.\nCollaboration underpins my whole approach. I’m working in partnership with everyone who has a stake in the North East. Our three constituent local authorities. The voluntary and community sector. Businesses large and small. And our trade unions.\nCollaboration requires meaningful consultation with our citizens, too. We’ve already delivered our Citizens Assembly on Climate Change. And I’m putting this in to practice with forums such as the Mayor’s Question Time events.\nMy next one – the fourth so far – is this Wednesday, 7th July, at 6:30pm. I’ll be talking about the good green jobs I’m creating in North of Tyne and how they are the bedrock for tackling poverty and protecting the planet. Great if you can join me – and I promise it will end long before the England vs. Denmark semi-final kick-off at 8pm.\nCo-design doesn’t stop with getting government to listen to us. It also means we listen to our people, including the North East voices that are often not heard. Young people, people with disabilities and those experiencing poverty.\nI’ve led a culture inside the Combined Authority which believes things must be done with people, not to people. It requires trust. It requires a willingness to tune into what people are saying. It means seeing marginalised people not as a burden but as resilient, capable and creative partners to solve their own problems. A bit like how central Government should view us!\nWe’re putting £80,000 in to the North of Tyne Poverty Truth Commission (PTC). There’s £20,000 match funding from the Tyne and Wear and Northumberland Community Foundation. Too often, policy makers wring their hands about poverty, but make no effort to understand the actual, on-the-ground problems that trap people. A PTC directly engages decision makers with the people experiencing poverty first-hand. The result? Practical measures that make a difference.\nCo-design also means trusting communities with resources. This Tuesday I’m launching our third Crowdfund North of Tyne. That’s £200,000 from the Mayor’s Capacity Fund, for Zero-Carbon, Zero-Poverty projects. It’s a springboard for locally-led greening and food security initiatives. I’m empowering communities so they can directly tackle the climate emergency and food poverty where they live. This goes hand in hand with the work I’m doing to transition the North East to a zero-carbon economy via our £18 million Green New Deal and £25 million investment in offshore wind.\nTrusting the regions and local communities with power and resources is the only way to level up. Along with my Metro Mayor colleagues across the North, I’m showing that when Westminster lets go of the reins so decisions are made here, we improve people’s lives.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 5 July 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-real-prize-is-transport/content_129.html": "The Real Prize Is Transport\nApril 30, 2023\nOne of our North East Labour MPs told me, “The best thing about London is getting the train out of Kings Cross on a Thursday night!” I don’t know about you, but I love that view of the Tyne Bridges when you arrive back in the region. I always look – it never gets old.\nLuckily as North of Tyne Mayor, most of my work is done here – with partners and the people of our region, delivering jobs and a brighter future.\nSometimes, though, the road to prosperity passes through Whitehall, so every few weeks I jump on a train and head south. Not because I want to eat pie & mash or take pictures of Tower Bridge, but to whisper in the ear of investors, businesses, and particularly government ministers. It pays off. Last year we were the number one region in the country for job creation from inward investment. We beat London, and Manchester. Not that you’d know that from the national news.\nIn my 2019 manifesto, I promised to bring the region together and get more power and money devolved here. When decisions are left in Whitehall, we slip down the priority list. Working with our local council leaders, I’ve delivered on that promise and secured a £48 million a year deal, way better than the £38 million that places like West Midlands, Manchester, or in fact any region gets.\nThe real prize, though, is transport.\nBack in February 2020 I was down in London, at the Treasury, talking to the Chancellor and junior ministers. Shy barins get nowt, I thought, and so pushed for the North East to get a huge transport settlement. “But you’re not united as a region” was the response, “so you can’t.”\nI called their bluff. “If we can unite as a region, can we have it then?” It’s taken a lot of work. A lot of ministers – and Prime Ministers – have come and gone. But starting in May next year we get £4.27 billion, building on the track record we’ve delivered at the North of Tyne over the past 4 years.\nIf elected as North East Mayor, I will build a Total Transport Network to connect the entire region – with integrated bus, metro and rail routes that will be so cheap, so fast, so safe and so reliable that people will start leaving their cars at home. If London can do it, why can’t we?\n“You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometime, you’ll find, you get what you need.” So sang the Rolling Stones. I’d like a proper pay rise for public sector workers. I’d like power and water, and mail and rail back in public ownership. I’d like to see free university education, and funding restored to schools and the NHS. I’m not going to get those powers – that will take a change of policy in Westminster, and let’s be honest, a change in government. I think long-term investment pays for itself, though – it certainly does in Germany and Denmark and other advanced economies. Austerity was always a false economy.\nBut this devolution deal will make a real difference. Already in the North of Tyne literally thousands of people have a job as a result of our investment. That changes their lives, their families, and boosts our regional economy. It’s the start of closing our health and education gaps – people in well-paid jobs is the basis of any progressive country.\nSince devolution we’ve increased the numbers of people getting training from 22,000 a year to 33,000 a year. That’s 11,000 people extra people getting qualified as goods drivers, chefs, welders or computer administrators. Earning more money. And we’ve got specialist programmes supporting those who need the most help.\nThis Monday is May Day, or International Workers’ Day. I’ll be out door knocking to get Labour councillors elected, to deliver on those Labour values of fairness, creating good, well-paid jobs. Then I’ll jump on a train and be off to talk to ministers and investors in London. Already this year we’ve secured an extra £9m to provide free, flexible training so people can work around existing shifts, or caring responsibilities. These trips to London pay off.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_is-it-a-blessing-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda/content_256.html": "“Is It A Blessing To Send Asylum Seekers To Rwanda?”\nMarch 26, 2023\n“Is it a blessing to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?” I was asked on telly last week.\nLast year Suella Braverman had a dream of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda. She’d now said it would be “a blessing” to be deported. The same Suella Braverman who had to resign as a security risk after breaching the ministerial code. Before being reappointed by Rishi Sunak six days later.\n“What would be a blessing,” I said, “is to treat asylum seekers with respect and dignity, and process their claims quickly.”\nAsylum seekers wait 440 days for an initial decision. People fleeing persecution, waiting for over a year to hear their fate, prohibited from working, living in hotel rooms with deteriorating mental health – it’s neither compassionate nor economically sensible.\nSir Philip Rutnam, former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, said productivity plummeted when asylum staff had their role downgraded in 2014. Paying civil servants less for the same job triggered an exodus. Ten years ago, each officer processed 13.7 cases per month. Now it’s just four.\n“I like your detail” said Jo Coburn, the presenter of BBC Politics Live, acknowledging the point.\nIf the debate was about logic, it would be over. If the debate was about morality and decency it would be over. But it’s not.\nSitting next to me was Conor Burns MP. The man who claimed Boris Johnson had been ambushed by a cake. Who in 2020 was forced to resign as a minister after the standards committee found him guilty of abusing of Parliamentary privilege. Who, after being reappointed as a minister, was again suspended after allegations of inappropriate touching in a hotel bar. He was subsequently cleared by an internal Conservative Party investigation.\nLater in the programme Mr Burns made a surreal speech in which he compared himself to Jesus, saying his suspension left him exiled “a few more days than Christ spent in the desert”.\nOn asylum seekers he said the public want this sorted out. That evil gangs exploit asylum seekers. And some of his constituents didn’t like people coming in small boats. And asylum seekers were staying in hotels. “This is about deterrence” and “those who genuinely want to claim asylum need fear nothing” from being deported to Rwanda.\nNote the dog-whistle language. “Those who genuinely…” implying most asylum seekers are conning us. Presumably by risking their lives in rubber dinghies.\n“What we’re getting into here,” I said, “is trying to blame asylum seekers.”\nHe played the “first safe country” card.\nMost refugees do stop in the first safe country. 14 million displaced Syrians have left their jobs and businesses and property behind. 6.8 million internally displaced in Syria. 5.5 million in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. 850,000 in Germany. And according to the UN, around 20,000 are in the UK.\nWhy deter asylum seekers? Would we deter victims of muggings from going to a hospital?\nIf I was facing bombs and famine, I’d try to get out with my wife and kids. And I would not want to raise my children in a refugee camp. Like the Syrian consultant anaesthetist I spoke to. Like all asylum seekers, he should be allowed to work.\nA ‘safe passage visa’ – suggested by Olivia Blake MP – would let people already in Europe come to the UK to make an asylum claim without risking their lives in the Channel. We could end the boats overnight. And the trafficking gangs. By letting asylum seekers get here legally, on trains, planes and ferries.\nBut I don’t believe Government wants to stop the boats. It gives them a big, juicy, culture-war story to distract from falling wages and crumbling public services. And foreigners to blame.\nSuella Braverman let the mask slip, “we have a problem with people exploiting our generosity”. Straight out of a Dickens novel, she believes refugees are beneath her. Unworthy and inferior citizens of the world who should be grateful for scraps. Dog-whistle racism.\nI recall someone else had a dream. That his four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.",

She’s been unemployed most of her life. “I am autistic,” she told me. Her last job didn’t last very long. Her boss was supportive, but he moved on. Her new boss had less patience. “Why can’t you just be like everyone else?” he’d complain. “Because I’m not like everybody else!” Her experience of discrimination runs deep.\nHannah was referred to our Diversity NE employment programme. We fund specialist employment coaches who have the time it takes to develop people’s confidence, and land a job. A decent job, paying decent wages.\nHannah explains her superpower. “I can read a screen for ages without getting bored.” She now works at the Tyne Tunnel, deciphering the photos that the automatic number plate recognition system can’t read. Her coach Gary, still checks in with her. People are supported even after finding work.\n“It’s the first permanent job I’ve ever had”, she said excitedly, “and it’s amazing… the team leader always makes sure I can participate in the team activities.”\nHannah is the reason I’m Mayor. Not just Hannah, but thousands like her, whose lives have changed because of what we do at the North of Tyne.\nLike Dale, a machine operator in North Shields. We helped his employer win a £multi-million order, and Dale was hired as they grew. “What were you doing before this?” I asked. “Mainly working away in the Baltic. Long shifts.” He’d go out for weeks at a time. He missed his family. “Now,” he said, “I get to read my daughter a bedtime story every night.”\nI’ve met hundreds of the thousands of people we’ve helped. Hearing their stories first hand helps me design better polices. Nothing is more expert than lived experience.\nTony Wells is MD of Merit Holdings, in Cramlington, Northumberland. I bumped into him at an investment conference recently. “Jamie, thanks so much for your investment,” he said, pumping my hand. “We’ve gone from 130 to 330 jobs!” They make modular clean rooms for the biotech industry and export them around the world. They had no room to expand. We helped them buy a factory that had been derelict for over ten years. Tony plans to grow again and create another thousand jobs.\nIn four years, from an organisation that didn’t exist, the North of Tyne is creating 5,049 direct new jobs. We’ve increased skills training places from 22,000 a year to 33,000 a year – when does a branch of government every get a 50% increase in value for money? We’ve persuaded a slew of international tech companies to locate here. Last year we were the number one region in Britain for inward investment. Every £1 I invest returns over £3 to Treasury in payroll taxes alone.\nLabour struggles to convince the electorate it can handle the economy. You’d think\nI was exactly the success story the Labour Party would want to shout about. So when they barred me from standing as North East Mayor, it shocked people from across the political spectrum. I’ve had literally thousands of messages of support.\nI identify as a socialist. Sometimes that puts me on a collision course with the Party leadership in London.\nMy first duty is to the people who elected me as their mayor. The Labour members here, in our region, chose me to represent them last time. They should have that choice again. It’s called democracy. Union leaders, MPs, and other Mayors are making my case, and asking for the decision to be reversed.\nThere’s a lack of trust in politics. Second homes. Second jobs. Cash for questions. Not me. £0 expenses claims. I pay for my own phone. I gave up my car and use my bike or public transport so I see what everyone else has to deal with.\nPolitics needs to change. We need a new direction. Power must reside in the North East, and in every region of Britain. Not in Westminster and Party HQs. I have a vision of a Britain that’s run in the interests of the people who do the work. And I believe we can get there. If you want to know more, have a look at my website. Shy Bairns Get Nowt.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_southgates-teamwork-shows-the-way/content_279.html": "Southgate’s Teamwork Shows the Way\nJuly 11, 2021\nIt’s difficult to type with your fingers crossed. But by the time you read this, we’ll know whether it worked, and football really has come home. I’m not claiming that it’ll all be down to my crossed fingers, mind. Or even the now anthemic Sweet Caroline – my wife’s name.\nThe key word for the England team is ‘team’. Including the ever-impressive Gareth Southgate as its leader. To win – to get anywhere in a match or a tournament – they have to work as a team. One player thinking he’s the only man on the pitch is a recipe for disaster.\nTeamwork duty has been a strong theme this past week, and not just in football. Last Tuesday, Andy Burnham and I gave evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee, looking at English devolution and whether it’s working. There’s a video link on my website, Facebook & Twitter if you’re interested.\nThe British state lacks teamwork. Projects that have to be delivered locally are still being designed centrally. Diktats come from the centre, without flexibility of delivery. Worse still, they are outsourced to firms that leave others to pick up the pieces when it goes wrong.\nSpeaking to the Committee, it would have been easy to blame a Conservative government, or the attitude of Whitehall civil servants for the failures of the centralised test and trace, Kickstart, or the now-scrapped Green Homes Grant. And yes, I’m no fan of this government or the London centric thinking of our national institutions. But the problems are also structural.\nEvery time I speak to a civil servant – from Treasury, Department of Transport, wherever – I find them professional, helpful, on top of their brief, capable of imagining new ways of doing things. Yet handcuffed by a system that prevents them from doing anything innovative. Their reporting lines are tortuous. Sign-off is labyrinthine. Their departments talk more to themselves than to outsiders.\nIn the North of Tyne, we’ve smashed our job creation target, delivered devolved adult education, and implemented our brownfield housing programme. Despite Covid, we’re ahead of target and brought them in under budget. Why? Because we know our region. We listen to people on the ground. We build relationships. In other words, teamwork.\nWe understand that everything is linked. Transport affects housing and planning. It affects climate change – we want fewer cars, not more. It affects skills – you can’t go to college if there’s no bus to get you there. It affects our economy. It affects our health – faster and cheaper public transport would get more people walking a little every day.\nI’ve been working with Ministers to get transport powers devolved. We have an offer of half a billion quid on the table – the Intra City Transport Fund. We’d have to come together as a region, North and South of the Tyne, into one Mayoral Combined Authority. Not least because the Metro can’t be half-in and half-out of a devolved transport area.\nOur seven local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether they want this money and these powers. We already know we can work well together – we’ve been working on the response to Covid and on our economic recovery plans throughout the pandemic.\nThis time last year, I was asked by central Government to develop a plan. I brought in the south of the region, the Local Economic Partnership, the trade unions, business organisations and the Universities. In September, we submitted a joint plan to the Comprehensive Spending Review. I believe we should unite as a region, work together as a team, and land that plan, which will create 55,000 secure, full-time jobs. And land that £half-billion devolved transport funding.\nAsk any Mayor if they’d like more money, and of course we’d say yes. But what I really want is not more fish, but a fishing rod. The power to generate more wealth here, for all of us. So there’s a well paid job and lifelong training available for everyone.\nI’m on leave with my family for the next fortnight. I’ve asked two groups I work closely with to be guest columnists.

The style I practice has one main rule – stop when someone signals they want you to stop. It’s a self-defence style, not a sport. There’s nothing fair about self-defence. You only need it when the odds are against you. You’ll only ever be attacked if the aggressor thinks they can win. They might be stronger, or armed with a knife. You might be outnumbered. There might be tables and chairs in the way. We trained with that in mind. Practitioners developed realistic expectations about what success looked like. They learned to deal with chaos.

If punching someone in the face is an illegal move, as it is in some striking arts and most grappling arts, then protecting your face is a waste of energy. This becomes a trained reflex. If groin strikes are illegal, you’ll not learn to protect your groin. If headlocks are illegal, you won’t learn how to get out of a headlock.\nThis too is a good analogy for politics. How we measure success determines the policies we pursue. Consider school league tables. Testing kids becomes more highly prized than nurturing their learning. Obviously, teachers are well aware of the problem but are compelled to comply with the rules.\nWe have a mental health crisis in our schools. I’ll repeat that last sentence again. We have a mental health crisis in our schools. Just as it’s hard to accept that a martial arts expert might never have learned how to evade a punch in the face, it’s mind boggling that education policy has fostered this crisis.\nThe North East is repeatedly at the bottom of inequality league tables. Health, wealth and life expectancy are all lower here. Our ability to raise money is limited. For instance, the business rates in London is £940 per person. In the North East it’s £300. Local taxation is not the answer. Levelling up requires more fundamental change.\nAs Mayor of the Combined Authority, I’m on the hook to create jobs and economic growth. I’ve made a cracking start creating jobs. But growth is a one-dimensional measure. Between 2010 and 2018 Britain had a 34% increase in GDP. We also had a 42% increase in knife crime, a 169% increase in homelessness and a 3900% increase in food bank use. A one dimensional focus on growth will not solve our problems.\nWe need to tackle many problems directly, and that means investing to save. Prevention is better than cure. But the rules discourage us.\nWhy should we invest in cycling, for example? It’s the right thing to do, and I support it. It improves people’s health, reduces congestion on the roads and improves air quality. But unless it leads to economic growth, I get no credit from the Treasury. I have to divert money from education and job creation.\nBut healthier people saves the NHS a fortune. It leads to better lives. It mitigates the massive costs of climate change. All the evidence shows that exercise makes us happier. And in the long term it increases productivity.\nWe need a system of devolution that allows us to keep the savings. Everybody knows that crime, ill health, congestion – all these things cost us dearly, financially and emotionally. But we operate in silos.\nThe Covid crisis will mean a cohort of disadvantaged youngsters will struggle with their education. If we can support them into meaningful work by the age of 19, and get the financial reward from it, we could invest in their training. We’d have the incentive that Treasury funding would repay us, so we’d invest upfront. It works financially, and it’s socially just.\nThis is how we can level up. The rules affect the outcome. To change direction, we have to change the rules.\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 11.5.2020",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_does-our-education-secretary-get-10-10/content_194.html": "Does our Education Secretary get 10/10?\nSeptember 10, 2023\n“Does anyone ever say you’ve done a f**king good job because everyone else has sat on their a*se and done nothing?” Education Secretary Gillian Keegan broke the first rule of politics this week – don’t mark your own work.\nAnd if your child is in one of the affected schools like Ferryhill in County Durham or St Anne’s in Gateshead you’re unlikely to give Britain’s education chief 10 out of 10. Indefinite online learning or a delayed start of term is not what parents wanted from the new school year.\nIf Mrs Keegan seems surprised to find the public ungrateful she might want to look back at her own government’s record.\n“We’re on the right track and we’ll fix the roof when the sun is shining,” tweeted then Prime Minister David Cameron a decade ago. Except his government didn’t fix the roof. It’s now in danger of falling down completely.\nEven normal concrete is porous – water can soak through. Autoclaved aerated reinforced concrete (RAAC) even more so – the middle is like a sponge. The water dissolves oxygen in it, and the rebar – the steel reinforcing rod – undergoes galvanic corrosion. Strong steel turns to flaky rust. And while RAAC is lightweight compared to concrete or bricks, it remains very heavy if it comes into contact with human skulls.\nNo one has been injured – yet. Thankfully. But the disruption and costs are huge. Short-term decision making is the bane of our public services.\nWho approved a 30-year building material for schools? It was widely used from the 1950s to the 1990s in public buildings. I mean, who said, “Oh, 30 years is ages – we won’t need schools by then.” My guess is short-term cost-cutting won over long-term sustainability. It’s a recurring pattern.\nThe Government has known about RAAC’s 30 year life expectancy since 1996 when John Major was prime minister. The last Labour Government launched its Building Schools for the Future programme in 2005. Michael Gove scrapped that programme when he was Education Secretary, a decision he apparently now regrets.\nBuilding Schools for the Future did transform many school buildings, but at a cost. It was a PFI programme. By 2016, nine North East PFI school programmes had been completed. Their cash value – if Government had just paid for the buildings – was £368 million. Using PFI, which adds on finance costs and expensive maintenance contracts, it cost £1,477 million. Four times more.\nDuring the National Audit Office’s 2011 investigation into PFI it was revealed one school paid £333 to have a light bulb changed. It sounds like a joke, but it’s true. Some directors of these PFI firms get paid over £3 million a year. Teachers had to strike to get a 6.5% pay deal – that’s less than inflation.\nAnd unlike Government borrowing, PFI contracts are index linked – so as inflation rises, taxpayers pay more. These companies take no risk. If you’ve ever wondered why working people pay more tax than ever, yet the Government says it has no money, there’s your answer.\nStep forward Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, boasting about his record as Chancellor. One of his first announcements was a “new 10-year school rebuilding programme” – 50 schools refurbished or rebuilt every year. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Until you realise there are 22,000 schools in England. So that’s 440 years between refurbishments. Mr Sunak previously said we need to teach more maths in this country. In his case, he’s right.\nNeither of the main parties has covered themselves in glory on this. Labour’s refusal to make any statement that might imply spending money one day has reached a new level of parody. Shadow Ministers rolled out to say in effect, “We won’t commit to fix crumbling school buildings – but ooh, look at those awful Tories.”\nOr to tackling child poverty by lifting the two-child cap. Or tackling the climate emergency by investing in renewable energy at scale. Or stopping ill health and wasting energy by retrofitting homes. The list goes on. All cheaper to fix now than to leave as financial time-bombs for our kids.\nUnless we look further ahead than the 5 year electoral cycle, we’ll always lurch from crisis to crisis.

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_retrofitting-is-a-short-sighted-waste-of-money/content_226.html": "Retrofitting is a Short Sighted Waste of Money\nJanuary 31, 2021\nDid you know the 2nd February is Groundhog Day?\nAt this very moment houses are being built which will need to be retrofitted. Retrofitting means installing something later which would have been easier and cheaper to include it when it was built.\nThis will cost about £20,000 per house. Who will pay? Probably the homeowner. How much would it have cost if it was built into the house? About £5,000.\nSo why would any government let something so obviously ridiculous happen? Well, let me tell you a story.\nBack in 2006, when people trusted banks and you could go to the cinema, there was a Labour government. They announced that all new homes would be “zero carbon” within 10 years. The 10-year phasing allowed industry to adapt. By 2016, all new homes would generate as much energy on-site as they used. With a guaranteed market and a 10 year lead-in companies could invest in developing technologies. Technologies would become cheaper and more efficient. We’d have a skilled workforce and a bright future of green jobs for young people. We’d be world leaders in green technology innovation.\nIn 2015 the Conservative government scrapped these planswith only 6 months’ notice. The official reason given in the government report was to “reduce net regulation on housebuilders”. In other words, lobbying behind closed doors. Good for the housebuilders’ shareholders. Bad for the people buying the houses, their heating bills, the environment, and everyone who lives on planet Earth.\n814,000 new homes have been completed in the last three years. All will need retrofitting.\nGovernment are talking about green homes once again. After all, the problem wasn’t going to go away. It certainly feels like Groundhog Day.\nRobert Jenrick, Secretary of State for housing, released a Planning White paper in August 2020. It said that from 2025, they “expect new homes to produce 75-80% lower CO2 emissions compared to current levels. These homes will be ‘zero carbon ready’”.\nThe obvious question is why ‘zero carbon ready’? Why not zero carbon? I asked him directly on a zoom call. He said he’d consider it. We’ve lost nine years and wasted 814,000 opportunities to have a zero-carbon housing stock. By 2025 we need to be more that ‘ready’.\nThe government has a target of 300,000 new homes a year. So by 2025 that’s another 1,200,000 homes to retrofit.\nIf you’ve bought a new build since 2016, or buy one in the next few years, these decisions are literally costing you money. About £15,000 in fact.\nExisting homes need retrofitting too. The UK’s housing stock is the oldest in Europe. We have low levels of construction and demolition. Around 70-80% of our buildings will still be used in 2050. Retrofit is looming large.\nAt the Combined Authority we’re developing our £10 million Green New Deal Fund to help organisations adapt to green energy. This is just a drop in the warming ocean though. Retrofitting everyone’s home will cost £billions.\nIn almost all cases it’s cheaper and more energy-effective to retrofit old homes than knock them down and start again. Our homes vary from Tyneside flats to Georgian townhouses, high rises and homes with gardens. The technical challenge is complex.\nRetrofitting means insulating walls (internally or externally), fitting air-tight window frames with double or triple glazing, and improving the efficiency of electrical and heating appliances. It could mean solar panels, and air- or ground-source heat pumps. Businesses tell me what they need most is a consistent pipeline of work. Then they can invest in equipment, train people up and build capacity.\nThe government introduced a £2 billion Green Home Grants scheme. You’d think it’s a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, it is in chaos. Applications take ages, vouchers are rejected and companies are not being paid. Why? Because instead of giving it to UK public servants with decades of experience, it was outsourced…to a private firm in Georgia, USA. So don’t try contacting them during UK office hours, they’re in a different time zone.\nWe need to create jobs and boost our economy, we need to reduce emissions. But you can’t outsource leadership. Government must act now.\nOriginally Published in The Journal and Evening Chronicle 1.1.21",

It is deep within the City of London in the Financial District. The whole place oozes money. £millions change hands at the drop of a hat. And many of the problems I’m dealing with started here, their roots in financial speculation undermining the foundations of our economy.\nI found myself here to attend the Global Investment Summit. This was a gathering of global business leaders and government leaders from across the UK. That was on Tuesday last week. So on Monday I got on a train with a mission to bring more jobs to the region, starting with a formal dinner at the Guildhall on the Monday evening.\nOn the way down to London I was reading The Northumbrians by Dan Jackson. A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting Dan, and his in-depth knowledge of the region piqued my interest. I’d highly recommend his book (and I’m not on commission).\nHe mentions about the Coal Exchange in London. It’s demolished now but was a magnificent building on the Banks of the Thames, 15 minutes walk from the Guildhall. Its place in the City of London and grandeur demonstrated the power and wealth that was shared by the North East. A grandeur that’s still reflected in some of the buildings here. During this time the North East was known for its hard-working people, inventiveness, and for enjoying a couple of drinks now and then. I believe none of that has changed.\nToday, even closer to the Guildhall, just around the corner in fact, is a Greggs bakery.\nHaving trumpeters in bearskin hats at dinner was a new one on me, along with loyal toasts to the Queen. There was a gentleman known as the Toast Master who introduced the speakers. To gain attention the usual “Ladies and Gentlemen” was preceded by a long list of Excellencies, Lords, Aldermen, Chancellor, Secretaries of State, and First Commoner. Not Mayors though.\nBut beyond the pomp I managed to have some productive conversations about real stuff with the business leaders there. Low carbon transport, offshore wind, health technology, future of hydrogen. I even talked to a rep from Mitsubishi about jiu jitsu.\nAfter the Guildhall Steve Rotheram, Andy Burnham and I decided to find a real pub for a proper pint. Steve said it was reported that £24 trillion was represented in that room. I had £30 in notes in my pocket, not sure if that was counted or not.\nTuesday morning, the Global Investment Summit began at the Science Museum. So I wound my way through a huge police presence, and off to the breakfast networking event. There was as much muesli and yogurt as you could eat…\nAt the keynote speech Mr Johnson regaled us with his after dinner speaking wit. I was hoping for detailed plans for the future of our country, but he focused on jokes about Peppa Pig. And said the free market would sort out the other problems.\nThe contacts and conversations were useful. I’d set up a string of meetings with people about developing their businesses here, in the North of Tyne. I have a stack of leads for my team to follow up, and we’re working hard to translate them into real jobs.\nThen it was back on the train, laptop out, until that amazing view of the Tyne bridges as you approach Central Station.\nBarely had I got my feet back on North Eastern soil, I put my suit jacket in my backpack and cycled over to Verisure’s Centre of Excellence near Longbenton.\nI spoke with Luis Gill, their founder and global president. I first spoke to Verisure two years ago, when we persuaded them to locate here. I told them I wanted to build a green economy based on good jobs. They told me they wanted to build a loyal workforce by treating their employees well. Two years on, they already employ 400 people. Now they’re recruiting another 100.\nAnd as for good work, they’ve just given their staff an average 12% pay rise. So if you’re after a job, send them your CV.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 25 Oct 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_lessons-from-the-2019-general-election/content_98.html": "Lessons from the 2019 General Election\nDecember 14, 2019\nMost of the analysis I’m reading about the election defeat is not analysis, but schadenfreude. I sometimes write polemics, and sometimes calls to arms, but today, let’s start with some facts, shall we?\nHere’s the last five elections. Total votes cast for Labour, and the percentage of the electorate at the time that voted Labour. Figures are often given as percentage of votes cast, but that’s less informative. The challenge for Labour is threefold:\n- get your base to turn out,\n- win votes from other parties, and\n- persuade causal voters to vote.\nExpressing the data as the percentage of the total electorate captures all three.\nSome will argue that it’s seats that matter. That’s true, of course. But to get seats you need votes. If you get them and still lose seats, that’s down to the electoral system. In 2019, in particular, the decision of Farage’s Brexit Party to split the vote by standing only in Labour seats was beyond the control of any Labour leader.\nA detail not shown in that table is that the SNP vote pretty much tripled from 2015 onwards, after the 2014 Indy Ref. I’m not close enough to Scottish politics to offer a detailed opinion, but clearly Scottish Independence is compounding Labour’s problems in Scotland.\nAll we can reasonably expect is that a good manifesto, good messaging, and a good leader will get us enough votes nationally, and local campaigns can maximise on that strategy.\nSome historical context. in 2005, Tony Blair had just come out of the Iraq war. Since that was a war of his choosing, he’s responsible for the electoral consequences. I’ll not go on a rant about him needing to face a war-crimes tribunal. He faced the utterly hopeless Michael Howard, with something-of-the-night about him.\nIn 2010, Gordon Brown had navigated the global financial crash. Any fair minded person would concede that was an external event, giving him at least a hill to climb, if not a mountain. He faced the slick, hug-a-hoody David Cameron and I-agree-with-Nick Clegg.\nBetween 2010 and 2015, Ed Miliband had faced Cameron after the Con-Dem coalition. The Lib Dem vote collapsed from 6.8 to 2.4 million, not least after their tuition fee betrayal. But UKIP rose from 0.9 to 3.9 million votes, predominantly in Labour heartlands.\nIn 2017, Jeremy Corbyn faced Theresa May in a post referendum landscape. Most of his Parliamentary Party had turned against him in 2016, but the party membership had nearly trebled.\nIn 2019 Jeremy Corbyn faced Boris Johnson. Brexit had become a national farce, dominating politics and the news for three years. Disaffected Labour right wingers had consistently publicly attacked him for four years, and some defected, asking people to vote Tory.\nSo they all had their challenges, but Blair’s were self-inflicted.\nWhat’s the relevance to the 2019 result?\nThere are three narratives competing to become the accepted truth of 2019.\n1) Labour lost because Jeremy Corbyn is personally unpopular.\n2) Labour lost because it was too left wing.\n3) Labour lost because of its Brexit position.\nLeaving Scotland aside, 1 (JC’s popularity) is partially true. 2 (too left wing) is false. 3 (Brexit) is evidentially true.\nWhat few have mentioned, though, is\n4) Labour’s campaigning methods are inadequate to 2019.\nLet’s take each in turn.\n1) Labour lost because Jeremy Corbyn is personally unpopular.\nThe hard evidence from the votes cast shows that whatever people felt about JC, he did pull in more votes than recent leaders. That’s evidentially true, whether in absolute numbers, or as a proportion of the electorate.\nMaybe more electors voted Labour because of him, maybe despite him. We’ll never know, because ballot papers don’t record this information.\nAnecdotally, there’s strong evidence that Jeremy was personally unpopular. The problem with anecdotal evidence is that it’s subject to confirmation bias. You notice what you expected to see, and tend to ignore what doesn’t fit your expectations.\nWhen knocking a Labour voters, the most frequent comment is a brief “Yep, I’m voting labour.” We tend not to mentally extrapolate this to, “And that implicitly means that I am happy with Jeremy Corbyn as leader and supportive of him being prime minister.” But that is what’s implied.\nIt’s certainly true that many people report voters saying they don’t like JC. But that was exactly the same with Blair (liar, warmonger, control freak), Brown (dour, miserable), Miliband (Marxist, intellectual, couldn’t eat a bacon sandwich). I knew a teacher who burned an effigy of Gordon Brown. I never got to the bottom of that particular irrational hatred.\nWhy is it that Labour leaders are unpopular? Both Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband are warm, authentic personal communicators. But only 0.01% of the electorate will ever meet them. With 80% of the press owned by far-right tax exile billionaires, and Britain’s ineffective press regulation, there’s so much mud, a lot of it sticks.\nIn JC’s case, the unprofessional and undisciplined behaviour of large parts of the Parliamentary Labour Party created a long running press saga. There were front bench resignations and people refusing to serve in the shadow cabinet from day one. Jess Phillips threatening to knife him in the front. The bungled coup attempt of July 2016. There was outright sabotage for four years, with MPs elected on Labour tickets who would rather see a Tory victory than a socialist win power.\nWhat effect does this have on the electorate? Voters expect opposing parties to throw mud. But when they see your own side bad mouthing the leader, it sticks. So those Labour MPs who could not accept the democratic result of the leadership elections must take a slice of the blame. It is unreasonable to say “people don’t like Jeremy” if you’ve been piling in for the past four years.\nThis is not a new phenomenon. The same occurred against Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, but nothing like to the same extent. We should have our policy debates at conference, and then MPs should support the party they stood for.\nThere’s also an element of exaggeration of the voters on the doorstep. On polling day someone said to me, “I’ve been a lifelong Labour voter, but not with that leader.” I checked the marked register, which showed that he had not voted at all in the last 8 elections. Some voters do lie to us.\nRelated to a leader’s popularity, is their performance in debates. There is never any hard evidence, it’s largely a judgement call. But it’s fair to say that in debates with Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn made some very solid points, and also missed some opportunities.\nMy feeling is that Jeremy was broadly on a par with Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband for ability. I can’t recall a Tony Blair debate. But it’s fair to say that Blair was one of the better political performers of recent decades. A large part of his early popularity was his ability, rather than his politics. This would explain why his popularity waned so quickly after he was elected.\nAnd there’s no correlation between a politician’s politics and their debating skills. John McDonnell would have ripped Sajid Javid to bits.\nI know a lot of people at home think politicians should have said X or challenged Y, but don’t knock it till you’ve tried it. It’s not easy performing under that much pressure.\n2) Labour lost because it was too left wing.\nThere is not even any anecdotal evidence for this. People support the policies. Everyone I speak to says voters were won over by polices, some said they didn’t like the leader, but liked the manifesto. And above all, the Tories have aped our approach and now pretend to be anti-austerity.\nThis is a classic case of “They’ll stop chasing you when you stop running.”\nIn summer 2015, wave after wave of commentator, Labour grandee and Guardian columnist claimed that an anti-austerity, pro-public investment manifesto would be disaster. They. Were. Wrong.\nYou have to wonder, if Ed had stuck to his guns and we’d gone with a stronger manifesto in 2015, would we have won? We’ll never know for sure.\nSome claim the 1997 victory was the result of a shift to the right. It wasn’t. In September 1992, Sterling crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. Labour took a 20 point poll lead. John Smith was on track for a 1997 landslide before his tragic death. Tony Blair took over and won with a 12.5% margin. New Labour lost votes ever after.\nThe 1997 Blair government implemented possibly the best Labour policy in my lifetime: the National Minimum Wage. At the time, it was genuinely radical. We got pilloried in the press: it would cause unemployment, businesses would collapse, inflation would rocket. But it was popular. People like radical policies, as long as they’re clear.\nOne lesson we can learn, is whoever replaces Jeremy, we must not revert to triangulation. Even now, our attacks on the Tories are blunted by them saying, “Labour did loads of PFI” or “Labour introduced tuition fees”.\n3) Labour lost because of its Brexit position.\nLabour found itself between a rock and a hard place. With around 90% of the membership being pro-European, backing Brexit was always going to be require us to campaign for something we thought was a bad policy. Many people in Leave areas warned that we would lose votes if we were pro-second referendum. That is undeniably true. You’ve only to look at the North East results and see the Labour votes shift to the Brexit Party in as close a correlation as you ever get in politics.\nThe counter argument is that if we had voted for Theresa May’s deal, we would have lost Remain voters. We can never know for sure, but it certainly sounds plausible.\nI doubt there exists a Brexit position that would have been electorally favourable. However, there could have been a Brexit approach that would have been more favourable. The party leadership adopted a don’t-interrupt-your-enemy-when-he’s-making-a-mistake approach while Theresa May was politically dying.\nThis may have worked, but for the fact that too many MPs showed no discipline whatsoever. It’s one thing to break a whip on a matter of political principle; I have no problem with principled politicians – I am one. But to run to the press every five minutes and have a go at your own Party is self-destructive. Chuka Umunna exemplifies this. In his brief 2015 leadership bid he called for immigration controls and respecting the anti-European feeling of voters. Then he did a Boris and decided his career would be better served by flipping his European position, and had already done the damage long before he left to found the Tiggers, and lost as a Lib Dem.\nAn alternative might have been to propose a clear deal of our own, rather than just a set of principles. We could have then engaged on the arguments for single market membership, or Norway+, or whatever. We’d have looked decisive. But Remainers would still have seen us as Leavers, and die-in-a-ditch Brexiters would have cried Brexit-in-name-only. And the chances of the PLP holding that line were zero.\nAfter 2015, Liz Kendall and Chuka Umunna both suggested we swing in a soft anti-immigration direction. This would be a mistake now. Most of last week’s Labour voters were pro-Remain, and are overwhelmingly progressive. We must not abandon BAME communities, in the hope of placating Europhobes.\nThe Brexit conclusion? This was always difficult. We have to take this one on the chin, and move on.\n4) Labour’s campaigning methods are inadequate to 2019.\nThis, more than anything else, is what needs addressing.\nWe failed to get the cut-through we needed. I suspect this is a universal opinion. We had some very strong policies that were very popular. But the manifesto, at 115 pages long, was not able to compete with “Get Brexit Done”. Our messaging was better in 2017, with simpler policies. Let’s forget\nLet’s not be carried away by strap-lines, either. They matter less than being able to simply explain your policies.\nThatcher had “The Challenge of Our Times” in 1983 and “The Next Moves Forward” in 1987. How crap are they? Vote for strong, fair, equal, change, together forward, Britain, stable change, future. All rubbish. Say what you’re going to do, then say it again.\n80% of the press is owned by far-right tax exile billionaires, and the broadcast media allow them to set the agenda. The Guardian was consistently undermining Corbyn, and pro-Lib Dem recently. Even the Mirror weighed in against JC in the leadership elections.\nDoor knocking can be effective, but it is a time consuming, skilled task. A personal conversation with an enthused activist is the second most effective way to win someone’s vote. (The first is talking personally to the candidate).\nMuch of our campaigning focuses on getting out the vote. But we need to persuade people to vote for us in the first place. If we want to talk to 52,000 electors in a constituency, just once per Parliament, that’s 200 conversations a week, every week, for five years. Not doors knocked, not voter ID, but authentic, two-way conversations. That requires finding people in, who are willing to talk.\nSo let’s do door knocking, but recognise it as primarily a GOTV activity, not a hearts-and-minds tool.\nWe need a heart-and-minds approach about values and principles between elections, and not just a transactional this-is-what-we’ll-do-for-you blitz at election time. We should see this in the same way that an artist builds up a following. Comedian, musician, writer – they all create an ongoing dialogue with their audiences, who get to know them. Select candidates early, and support them with tools and training. It would be money well spent.\nThis dovetails with community organising and building a presence on social media, including blogs and videos for each constituency.\nWe need to find a way for the majority of our half-a-million members to contribute easily. We need software that is easy for beginners to use, that allows production of personal, almost blog style leaflets introducing candidates. Too often our leaflets try too hard – a few bullet points that come across a bit too sales like.\nBetween elections, let local parties fund and get out simple but authentic leaflets to every home. This needs simpler ways to track what’s been put out, and where. Many of our current tools have a steep learning curve that cuts out most members. We’ve started to make strides on this as a party, but we have a way to go.\nRunning like a red thread though all of this has to be genuine dialogue. Not “you should vote for us because…” but “what sort of world would you like to live in?” and “what can we do here?” Definitely not a continuous pop at the Tories or Lib Dems on the local council, but something that appeals to the positive parts of the imagination.\nYes, we will replace Jeremy with a new leader, that’s going to happen. But like Ed Miliband before him, and Gordon Brown before him, she will be vilified by the press using any hook they can.\nWhat we must retain is the mass membership, increasingly diverse campaigning methods, and the baby steps we’ve taken towards democratising the party.\nBoris Johnson and the Tories are unable to deliver the land of Brexit milk and honey. His honeymoon will be short. We must keep our strong polices on climate change, which will grow as an issue over the next five years.\nWe need to be on the ground, to stop far right populism growing. The opportunity for a socialist government is still there. The evidence shows it. To win, we must learn from what’s happened and build, rather than a knee-jerk reversion to centralised centrism.",

Just lights. Two actors walk on. One plays the Mam, another plays the Dad. A tense discussion about paying the water bill. He’s trying to assure her it will be alright. They’ll find a way, somehow. She chafes at the platitude. Their daughter Holly, needs new boots. I’m not going to a foodbank, I’m not, she insists. The indignity. Feeling you’ve failed.\nAnother actor walks on, playing Holly. Can we have the heating on, Mam, she asks. It’s freezing. Tempers fray, they argue. Holly gets sent to her room. Mam and Dad navigate an awkward silence. I’ll have a word with her, Mam says.\nMy summary doesn’t do it justice. The emotion, the authenticity, the raw credibility of the scene struck home. A young girl blaming herself for causing a family argument by asking for the house to be warm.\nThe audience at the Live Theatre were spellbound. Doubly so, because this was a youth theatre production of Fed Up. Researched, written and performed by young actors. The girl who wrote the scene was 12 years old.\nThere were a dozen more scenes, linked by theme. All unearthed political truths behind food poverty. Austerity is a political choice. Politicians were mocked for banal platitudes. The young people see Starmer as they see Sunak. “Self-serving, self-indulgent, self-righteous.”\nOne young actor, in a spotlight, invited us to, “Imagine an alternative timeline.”\n“In 2008, after the financial crash, our politicians chose to change strategies and run Britain in the interests of the people who do the work.\n“A little lad called John is born into a relatively poor North East family. His Dad leaves when he’s 3. He has two older sisters, so his Mam takes a job as a cleaner. However, he gets government support, and free school meals, through the holidays, too. John’s Mam can afford to buy him books, and a Lego train set. He loves that train set. John believes he has a future. Teachers at school have time for him. He works hard. In 2030, John graduates from Northumbria university with a degree in mechanical engineering. He works for Nexus, and designs a new Metro that cuts our emissions and takes an extra 10,000 people to work each day. Fast forward 40 years, and John retires at 65, happy that he made a good living and helped others. He gets to watch his grandkids become doctors and artists.\n“Now I’ll claw you back to the world we live in. Run in the interests of billionaires and tax dodgers. John was a third child, and so got no government support. He was too hungry to learn in school, so failed his GCSEs. He couldn’t find work, and, aged 25, was found floating face down in the Tyne, with needle marks on his arm.”\nWritten by a 16 year old. And delivered with real talent. I choked up with tears.\nThe kids who wrote and performed Fed Up had talent. And confidence. But like the story of John, that’s a result of support and nurture.\nIf re-elected in May, I will fund a Youth Voice programme. Right across the North East, including the towns and villages away from the city centres. This will be a network of arts and youth practitioners, and support for existing local groups.\nI want our young people to tell their stories. To be proud of their home town. It might be acting, or spoken word. It could be painting murals on public buildings. It could be singing, or African drumming. Let them choose. Feeling you have a voice changes your life.\nThere’s an irony, of course, that Fed Up was at the Live Theatre, where I spoke to Ken Loach about his films. Neither Ken nor I are welcome in the Labour Party anymore. That’s despite I, Daniel Blake, Sorry We Missed You, and The Old Oak. All set in the NorthEast. All challenging the political choices that cause poverty. And despite the fact that as Mayor I’ve funded a Child Poverty prevention programme in over 100 North East schools.\nKeir Starmer’s Labour Party that has now adopted the two-child benefit cap that keeps 45,000 North East children in poverty.\nAfter Fed Up, there was a Q&A with some of the young actors, and people who run foodbanks. Their depth and awareness was impressive. I asked them. “Do you see any hope that this will change? That our politicians will get it?”\n“If we keep trying to persuade the government and the opposition that they need to change tack, we’ll be waiting forever,” said one of the young actors. “We need to replace them with people who are on our side.”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-would-a-universal-basic-income-look-like/content_222.html": "What Would a Universal Basic Income Look Like\nApril 19, 2021\n42, as every HG2G fan knows, is the answer to life, the universe and everything. It’s also the title of a crowdfunded book including Douglas Adams’s notes on work, life and technology. His memo-to-self shows that even a writer with his confidence and fluency struggled. “Writing isn’t so bad, really…” he wrote, and “…attack it, don’t let it attack you”\nI’m sure Douglas Adams will have experienced a thrill of achievement when he finished the four books in the trilogy. But that got me thinking about the link between work and motivation.\nThere’s obviously the extrinsic motivation of work: the need to pay the bills and, if your job pays enough, to build up some savings for a rainy day. Then there’s the intrinsic motivation of work – the enjoyment we get from it, whether camaraderie, sense of social contribution, or the achievement of a job well done.\nThere was a great academic study funded by the US Federal Reserve Bank, examining the link between money and motivation. They were surprised by their results. If the task was a basic mechanical job – shovelling dirt into the back of a wagon, say – then paying a bonus improves performance. But a task that involves even rudimentary cognitive skill – planning or creativity – a larger bonus reward leads to poorer performance.\nOther studies have shown that autonomy and trust – trust in us as employees, and trust between employees – are much, much stronger motivators than money. In fact, the best use of money as a motivator, is to pay people enough to take the question of money off the table. When people know they are financially secure, they work better.\nWhich, by the way, blows the argument for £multi-million bonuses out of the water. Serco is the latest example, the firm awarded the privatised test and trace contract. Despite the National Audit Office report that there was “no evidence the £22bn programme had reduced rates of Covid-19 in England”, Rupert Soames, brother of a Tory MP and CEO of Serco, will get a £4.9 million payout this year. Clearly no correlation between social value and personal reward there.\nWhat of the dignity of labour? Most of us instinctively feel there’s a link between work and a sense of self-esteem that goes beyond money. In a report called, intriguingly, ‘The Employment Dosage’, researchers at Cambridge University answered the question: ‘How Much Work is Needed for Health and Wellbeing?’ The study lasted nine years and involved 71,000 people. The result is surprising. One day a week. One day a week gives us all the social and psychological benefits of working 5 days or more.\nThe automation is already available to enable us to work a 3 to 4 day week. The challenge is not productivity, but the distribution of wealth. I‘d wager that most people would work fewer hours if they had enough money to pay their bills and support their families. But how much would that be? Would a Universal Basic Income be the answer? How would we set the level of UBI?\nIn 1930, the eminent economist John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay called Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren. He suggested that, within a century, an enormous growth in productivity and resultant increase in living standards would mean that people could choose to work only 15 hours a week. In terms of basic productive output, he was right.\nWe should be thinking about which jobs really need to be done. It’s difficult, though – how many people would be happy to say their job wasn’t necessary? A YouGov survey found that 37% of Brits thought their job did not contribute ‘meaningfully’ to the world. So, 1 in 3 people feel if their job was not done, the world would be no worse off.\nWhich takes us back to Douglas Adams. His Golgafrinchans divided their society into three: the thinkers, the doers, and the “middlemen” – who did pointless jobs. They sent the useless third off to a distant planet (Earth), keeping only the useful people back on Golgafrincham. Sadly, they were wiped out by a raging virulent disease, caught from dirty telephones. And Earth ended up with the telephone sanitisers, middle managers and tired TV producers.\nOriginally Published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 19.4.21",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-blame-game/content_95.html": "The Blame Game\nDecember 8, 2019\nLeadership is difficult to quantify. It should be a defining characteristic in our politicians, a blend of gravitas, consistent values, integrity, and the courage to stand firm when others flinch. We’ve seen real leadership this week, but it’s come from footballers. Last Monday’s Euro Qualifier saw 26 year-old Tyrone Mings stand strong against monkey chants and Nazi-salutes, with his team mates in full solidarity, followed by dignified press interviews. This weekend saw Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town walk off the pitch after racist abuse, with Cameroonian goalkeeper Valery Pajetat being spat at.\nThe irony is that last week was Hate Crime Awareness week. In the past five years, hate crimes have more than doubled, with a big spike after the Brexit referendum. The 122% rise may in part be the result of better recording, but everyone I speak to reports a genuine increase across the board: racism, religious bigotry, homophobia, transphobia, disability abuse and misogyny.\nHate Crime is a complex sociological issue, but I’ll draw out two strands: stereotyping, and blame.\nWe all rely on prejudice to navigate daily life – literally pre-judging people, based on their age or clothing. We pre-judge which stranger is likely to give us reliable directions or advice, based on their face and expression. The line between snap judgements and lasting stereotyping is where the problem begins. How can we know about our unconscious biases if they’re unconscious?\nThis week’s incidents of racist football crowds will reinforce the perception that football fans are inherently racist. But it was the England fans in Bulgaria who chanted back, “Who put the ball in the racists’ net? Raheem F***ing Sterling!” Wit and solidarity from the terraces, a moment of hope, not hate.\nThe assumption that bigotry is most prevalent amongst the “white working class” is itself a stereotype. Negative attitudes to immigrants are higher amongst households with incomes of £25,000 to £50,000 than amongst lower income households. Bigotry, and unconscious bias, is prevalent right up the income ladder. It’s not the “white working class” who are paying black male graduates 17% less than white graduates, or £3.90 an hour. It’s not people on council estates paying women 9.6% less than men. And the editors of those tabloids so keen to push xenophobia are not short of a few quid, neither are their billionaire owners.\nThen there’s blame.\nBlame first requires labelling others as deserving mockery or contempt. Attitudes change over time. Last year, Netflix’s algorithm put the Two Ronnies into my recommended list. Some of the sketches have clever wordplay, Four Candles being a classic, but I’d forgotten how many are based around causal racism and routine sexual harassment. But as we entered the millennium, it seemed that racism, homophobia and sexism were in retreat.\nThen came Farage & co, channelling the spirit of Enoch Powell. It wasn’t financial speculation that meant your kids couldn’t afford a house, it was foreigners.\nWe saw Theresa May’s “Hostile Environment,” used to direct attention from the loss of frontline police from 124,000 in 2010 to 104,000 in 2018.\nThe 2016 referendum was fought on blame. I heard people screaming “traitor” at campaigners on street stalls. The current frenzy is “get Brexit done”.\nA question has disappeared from public debate: why? What is the problem that a hard Brexit will fix?\n1.6 million people have needed foodbanks in the last year. 210,000 homeless children in the UK. Is the European Parliament to blame for that? Or the fact that 1 in 4 northerners earn less than the Real Living Wage? If it is, let’s hear the evidence.\nThe imminence of Brexit worries many; trade barriers and the loss of jobs. There are also faults with the EU, not least the way agency workers are exploited.\nOur politics needs to drop the frenzy of blame, and return to debating policy. Temper tantrums and threats to “die in a ditch” are not the leadership we need.\nOtherwise, who will we blame once we’ve left the EU?\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 21st October 2019.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_look-after-your-staff-and-they-will-look-after-you/content_207.html": "Look After Your Staff and They Will Look After You\nJanuary 3, 2021\nJanuary, it’s said, is named after the Roman god Janus. He’s depicted having two faces, one looking into the past and the other the future. He’s the overseer of transition and change.\nLooking back at January 2020, I doubt even a Roman god could have foreseen the year we actually had.\nI’ve been looking back at the column I wrote in the first week of January last year. It had been a busy eight months after being elected. Setting up the new Combined Authority, appointing my team, building relationships and kick-starting the programmes to regenerate and reinvigorate the region’s economy.\nWe’d just come through a turbulent General Election. Seats in the North that had always been Labour strongholds were lost to the Tories, but I was looking forward to a year where I’d be able to deliver my manifesto pledges.\nThen the first lockdown in March happened, and none of us knew what that would mean for the region’s economy. Or the country’s. Or how long it would go on for. Then we had the Tier system, and a second wave of the virus, and then the second lockdown. Now we’ve got a new variant, and probably another national lockdown.\nDespite COVID, lockdowns, staff working from home, homeschooling, Zoom, Zoom not working, and “you’re on mute”, we’ve accomplished a huge amount.\nWhen I say ‘we’ this isn’t false modesty, or humblebragging. It’s true that I’m the political face of the Combined Authority, but there’s an engine room of skilled, dedicated people working with me. All of them enthusiastic about championing the region we love.\nWe’ve demonstrated the success of the Mayoral Combined Authority model. We have programmes in place to deliver 2,732 new jobs, and have safeguarded another 1,782. We’ve successfully handled the devolution of the £23 million Adult Education Budget. And we’re managing the £24m devolved Brownfield Housing Fund, going from announcement to spades in the ground within just six months. Homes and jobs is a solid foundation for recovery.\nWe’ve been working closely – and effectively – with authorities south of the Tyne. There’s a joint focus on improving transport to the whole of the North East. That followed March’s budget, where the Chancellor announced £4.2 billion for transport funding. We’ll only get our share of that –around £500 million – if the North East’s seven local authorities join in a single Mayoral Combined Authority. The experiences of the pandemic have shown how well the North East can work together. We’ve developed a joint recovery plan that will form the basis of negotiations with Government.\nThe epidemic did delay our plans for the Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Change, but face-to-face meetings will be replaced with Zoom. This week, letters will be sent out to randomly selected residents of North Tyneside, Northumberland and Newcastle. They’ll be asked to take part in the Assembly and consider the question ‘What should we do in the region to address climate change and its causes fairly, effectively and quickly?’ It’s asking what kinds of changes and trade-offs they would support to protect our collective future. We’re looking forward to the work that will come out of it.\nOur Green New Deal is rolling out, boosting the offshore wind sector and the low carbon economy. We’ve set up a £5 million innovation fund to create a digital ecosystem for public services and small businesses in the region. We’re continuing to work with our Local Authorities to set up more Community Hubs. I was proud to announce that the Combined Authority was an accredited Living Wage Employer with a zero gender pay gap. We’ve launched our Good Work Pledge, encouraging employers large and small, to look after their staff. The pledge promises job security, progression opportunities, and fair wages to all their employees.\nAt the end of a long and trying year came some good news. A company called BritishVolt is hoping to open its Gigafactory here, manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles and providing 3,000 jobs. In a pleasing twist of fate, “the world’s cleanest and greenest battery facility” will be built on the site of the old Blyth coal-powered power station.\nI’m looking forward to seeing just what we can achieve in 2021.

I’ll say!\nJuly 23, 2023\nA week is a long time in politics. I’ll say!\nRight now I’m looking at the Sunday morning rain drenching the Lakeland landscape, reflecting that a week ago I was still a Labour Metro Mayor.\nI was ostensibly on leave last week. My wife’s a GP in Gateshead and books her leave months in advance.\nLast Saturday we went to a beer festival in South Gosforth. People kept coming up to me, “Can I shake your hand?” “It’s terrible the way the Labour Party has treated you!” “You should run as an independent.”\nYou know the story – Labour HQ blocked me for factional reasons. The backlash has been intense – people walking out of meetings, members leaving the Party, councillors resigning the whip. People sick of the policy U-turns. Tackling the climate emergency. Ending NHS privatisation. Tuition fees. Taxing capital gains at the same rate as income. Taxing tech giants.\nI asked my family over dinner, “Should I run as an independent?” Nelson, my younger son, answered, “You’re still going to campaign and fight for a better world. Why not fight for something where you’ll have the power to do something about it?” It’s hard to argue with that logic.\nSo I wrote to Sir Keir Starmer resigning from Labour. You can read it on my website – JamieDriscoll.co.uk. The news broke on Monday. I was in London with think tanks and campaigners, discussing making politics more participatory. Millions of people feel no one listens to them. My phone went haywire – could I come on the BBC? ITV. Sky. Channel 4. Andrew Marr and John Pienaar. Radio and podcasts and webcasts.\nGoing up against big party machines – with their slick press offices – is a David and Goliath struggle. So I’d set up crowdfunder. A campaign will cost over £150,000, but if I can raise £25,000 by the end of August, I said, I’ll run. The response was overwhelming. We smashed that target in 2 hours.\nThe media circuit finished with Newsnight, discussing Labour’s U-turn on the two-child benefit cap. Keeping kids in poverty is extraordinarily expensive and morally wrong. How on Earth did we get to a place where the Labour Party is justifying Tory policies that keep kids in poverty?\nI’d hadn’t eaten, so at 3am was munching through a bag of Kettle chips, writing a Guardian op ed, laptop on my knee, sitting on the bed of a tiny basement room in a budget hotel. Glamorous, politics isn’t.\nMore media on Tuesday, including Politics Live. Wednesday showing Guardian journalist Helen Pidd our investments in Blyth bringing hundreds of renewable energy jobs. Then NUCastle, where our £2.6 million investment helps kids and young adults get skills and confidence – and jobs paying decent money.\nThursday at St Thomas More school. Students and Tyne & Wear Citizens thanked me and others for helping get cheaper bus fares – and for listening to them. People sidled up – “I’ve donated to your Crowdfunder.” “I used to leaflet for the Labour Party – can I leaflet for you now?”\nFriday up in Berwick campaigning against ticket office closures. I bought my ticket at Central station, where the staff showed me a copy of my last week’s column supporting them. Again in Berwick, people saying they’d donated to the crowdfunder, could they join the campaign?\nSaturday morning, Northern Pride. We’ve provided £70,000 to keep the village and events free – important during a cost of living crisis. People asking for selfies, saying they’d donated, can they campaign for me. Then finally over to the Lakes where I’ll turn my phone off this week and actually spend some time with my family.\nAs I write, 5,300 people have donated to the crowdfunder – thank you all. I’ll reply to your messages when I get back. This comment sums it up:\n“As a North East resident I’m excited by Jamie’s plans, particularly the Total Transport Network. He also understands that the climate emergency requires urgent action. He seems like a really solid lad born and raised in the NE and has good values. The factionalism displayed by Keir Starmer and the Labour Party in excluding him is deeply concerning. But we won’t let them undermine local politics in the North East. Howay Jamie!”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_alls-well-that-ends-well/content_319.html": "All’s Well That Ends Well?\nOctober 23, 2022\nLast week the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was in competition to see if she could outlast a lettuce. She lost.\n“If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction,” says Fabian, in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. One of my retired friends texted me with more contemporary language, “Cabinet ministers ‘unequivocally’ backing Boris Johnson. WTAF?”\nAt PMQ’s two weeks ago, the PM promised “Absolutely, absolutely,” no public spending cuts. Since then the Home Secretary resigned. Poor Suella, deprived of her dream to oversee the deportation of refugees to Rwanda in time for Christmas. Monday’s emergency statement ditched Trussonomics. Jeremy Hunt eviscerated the PM’s authority with promises to cut spending to every department. The U-turn on a U-turn over the state pension triple lock. Pushing and shoving to bully MPs to vote for environmentally destructive fracking. The Chief Whip and her deputy resigned and unresigned.\nThe Government rowed back on their flagship energy policy – which they all supported. No U-turn on removing the cap on bankers’ bonuses, mind. Bankers are the one cohort the Tories protect from the cost of living crisis.\nWednesday’s PMQs saw the lettuce-opponent bellow she’s “a fighter not a quitter”. Then promptly quit the next day.\nRishi Sunak is the bookies’ favourite to replace her. A man whose personal family fortune is larger than the King’s. Mr Sunak is the richest person to ever to sit in Parliament, and as Chancellor oversaw the biggest increase in inequality ever. His wife dodged £20 million a year with her non-dom tax status.\nBut fear not! Boris Johnson flew back from his Caribbean holiday. His constituents may ask why he’s on holiday while Parliament was sitting. He’s paid £84,144 to represent them. It’s his third foreign holiday since his July resignation, after visiting Slovenia and Greece while still serving as Prime Minister and collecting his £161,401 salary. So it’s okay for him, but when a postie or rail worker wants to earn enough to afford even one holiday a year, they are “militant unions”.\nI was in a meeting with my team on Tuesday morning when my phone rang, the caller was the BBC. “Before I answer this, can someone check if she’s resigned?” I asked. On Wednesday I was speaking to a hundred small businesses about the North of Tyne investment funds available to help businesses grow. Despite the national chaos, I reassured them, the North of Tyne is a rock of stability. On Thursday I was speaking to another set of businesses about our Challenge fund to encourage innovation in delivering low-carbon homes. I checked my phone before I started to make sure my speech wasn’t out of date. By the time I walked back to my office 100 yards away, the team had a laptop open watching the PM’s resignation speech.\nI would say this is all a comedy, but for the real life tragedy. Even the Financial Times rubbished the PM’s economic mess with its “Moron Risk Premium” – the extra money Britain pays to borrow because of Government incompetence. Millions of people are paying an extra £500 or so a month for their rent or mortgages because of moronic Government decisions.\nIt’s affecting businesses too. To get through Covid they had to take out loans. One brewer told me he’s planning to consolidate them into one payment. But now interest rates are spiking – far higher than in comparable countries. Britain is seeing 1 or 2 independent breweries go bust every week. That affects their suppliers, who won’t get paid, and their staff, losing their jobs in a cost of living crisis.\nI’m not one for schadenfreude. But the Tories have long since lost any credibility for integrity. Boris Johnson and Partygate hammered the nails into that particular coffin. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng dismembered Conservative economic credibility more efficiently than an industrial grade shredder. Jeremy Hunt’s reprise of austerity’s greatest hits reminded us all how David Cameron and George Osborne crippled education, heath, transport, closed libraries and spawned foodbanks, and created this mess in the first place. A true Comedy of Errors.\nIt’s time to call a General Election and get a Labour Government. The last poll I saw put the Tories on 19%, with Labour on 56%. That’s a literal wipe out. Not one single Tory MP returned. All’s Well That Ends Well?",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-curious-incident-of-the-spring-statement/content_314.html": "The Curious Incident of the Spring Statement\nMarch 27, 2022\n“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” asked Inspector Gregory of Scotland Yard.\n“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time” replied Sherlock Holmes.\nThe Chancellor’s Spring Statement contained five notable omissions.\nFirstly, he opened by blaming the cost of living crisis on the invasion of Ukraine. But omitted to say wholesale energy prices had spiked before Christmas. Mr Sunak is not to blame for the rise in global energy prices. But his Government has stood by and watched companies rake in profits by the £10s of billions. And they have form in keeping us hooked on fossil fuels. A decade of on-off investment in renewables, dodgy ties with even dodgier oligarchs, and a keystone-cops approach to insulating homes has left Britain’s vulnerable, vulnerable. Food prices are up, too. Durum wheat, which makes pasta, has shot up 90% as a result of freak heatwaves and failed harvests in Canada.\nWhich takes us to the second omission, the curious absence of COP. Back in November, decarbonising was our no 1 priority. Today’s announcement that VAT on home insulation materials would be reduced from 5% to 0% is weak by any standards. Where is the retrofit programme? David Cameron’s 2013 decision to “cut the green crap” saw domestic insulation retrofits plummet from 1.5 million homes per year to near zero. Insulating buildings will reduce bills, NHS admissions, and create jobs.\nIt’s so financially viable that my Combined Authority has launched a Green New Deal fund where we make capital available on a commercial basis and consumers pay for it with energy savings. Britain is crying out for a national version of this.\nThen there’s the curious omission of levelling up. For the PM’s flagship policy and favourite catchphrase to be missing is curious indeed. Mr Sunak might claim that equalising the NICs threshold with income tax is a form of levelling up. Equalising the rates is obviously sensible. But the numbers don’t lie. The 1.25% NICs increase will still happen, and raise £14 billion. This equalisation will cost £6bn. So he’s taking a net £8bn increase in taxes from employment. While incomes from rent, dividends and capital gains all remain lower than working for a living.\nHe was almost honest, though, in saying why. He has a plan, he said, to bribe us with our own money in 2024, cutting income tax from 20p to 19p. So that’s nice.\nThe fourth omission is a lack of any stimulus. He acknowledged that Britain’s R&D has been poor since the financial crash, along with the weakest OECD private sector investment. A frank mea culpa, given his party has been in power for 12 years. Add in the loss of disposable income from household bills rising £1700 a year, and we’re flirting with recession.\nSo where is the solution? There was talk of tinkering with tax credits. But why not turbocharge offshore investment? At £40 per MWh, offshore electricity is a fifth of the price of gas. Cheap clean energy would make Britain an industrial powerhouse. And let’s change the local content rules so the turbines get manufactured here, in Britain.\nMr Sunak’s fifth and final omission was his failure to make eye contact, shake hands or even acknowledge the presence of the Prime Minister sitting next to him. No levelling up. No climate action. No plans to fix anything, in fact. It’s almost as if he doesn’t want to rescue an unpopular PM.\n“The Chancellor did nothing in the spring time,” said the detective. “That was the curious incident.”",

You might have read that corporate CEO pay has rocketed to 120 times that of their average worker. You’re probably aware that people are volunteering to help with Covid jabs. What links them all?\nSome cheese slices, tin of beans, loaf of bread a little bit of veg and not much else is supposed to provide ten meals. Meant to come to £30 worth of food. Even at retail prices, it’s about £5.22. The real scrooge part was seeing that penne pasta had been removed from its original packaging and doled out in little plastic bags. How tight is that? Even at supermarket prices, it only costs £1 for a kilo of brand-name pasta.\nThe companies get an administration fee and packaging and shipping fee. The parcels are supposed to contain £15 worth of food per child per week.\nLet’s not forget free school meals are taken up by kids of all ages. My eldest son is 14 now. That food parcel wouldn’t last him ten minutes, never mind ten meals. Like most teenage boys, he’d trough the lot in one go.\nChartwells is the corporate profiteer in this case. Owned British catering giant the Compass Group, they won’t be paying supermarket prices for food. Last year they posted a profit of £1.2billion. Their chairman was Paul Walsh, a multi-millionaire Tory party donor and member of David Cameron’s Business Advisory Group.\nAnd let’s not fall for the idea that their profit is paying for the free school meals. Corporation tax contributes only 6% of UK tax revenues. Payroll taxes and indirect taxes (VAT, fuel, etc) raise most of our public expenditure. Tax comes out of the pockets of ordinary citizens, and into the pockets of the mega-rich.\nOn the subject of wealth inequality, “High Pay Day” was January 6th this year. The day when the typical FTSE 100 chief executive has already been paid what the average worker gets for the whole year. After just 34 hours under their belt.\nThe pay gap between executives and workers is particularly acute in the retail sector. Ocado, the online supermarket, paid chief executive Tim Steiner £57.8 million last year, that’s 2,605 times the £22,500 Ocado’s delivery staff get on average. It’s those staff who are doing the work, generating the profits. Meanwhile, Mr Steiner paid £50,000 to the Conservative Party. How long would it take those delivery drivers to save up £50,000?\nIt’s easy to be outraged when kids have their food stolen by profiteers. There’s noticeably less outrage that the rich are getting richer while real wages fall and unemployment rises. And hardly anyone is asking why we’re not paying people for giving life-saving vaccines in a pandemic.\nIt’s great when people volunteer – I encourage it. Less great is the shortage of medical staff caused by government raiding their pensions to pay for the banking crisis the billionaires never paid for. In fact, it’s egregious that many of these volunteers are suffering a pay freeze – a real terms pay cut. Yet £22 billion was thrown at conglomerates with track record of failure to run a failed test & trace system. Funny that it was a Tory MP’s wife who got the gig.\nNo one is connecting these issues because British public debate is banal. It distracts from the real question: who has power? Perhaps you’re okay with that. Or resigned. It’s hard not to become numb when we see homeless people, hungry kids, small businesses folding, public servants burned out from overwork, our elderly relatives dying from Covid in care homes, and our kids accruing debt before they can even afford a deposit for a home.\nThe greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.\nThere’s not some vast international conspiracy, run by a shadowy Keyser Soze. But there is an establishment that maintains a legal, political and economic system based on property rights. It has been shaped for centuries, with mechanisms to ensure wealth flows from ordinary people to rich people. And it is out of control. Britain is run in the interests of a kleptocracy.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle",

Too often Labour politicians shy away from supporting unions. Unionised workplaces are more productive, more innovative, and have lower staff turnover.\nThat’s why when the Tories cut the Union Learn project, I stepped in and funded it. It’s a project that coordinates a network of trade unionists to operate in workplaces helping predominantly low paid workers enrol on training courses, so they could earn more money and benefit their employers. A project that for every £1 spent gave £13 back to the economy. It was nothing but ideological spite. We’ve restored it and made it stronger – because unionised workplaces are more productive, safer, and look after their staff. And because we have a Labour Mayor, the union learn project is not just saved in the North of Tyne, it’s stronger than ever and we’ve expanded it from one full time worker to four.\nI meet with the regional trade union secretaries every quarter, and I’ve supported them, through every industrial dispute, and stood with them on picket lines.\nI will stand in solidarity with working people in dispute. I’ve supported:\nASLEF, NUJ, RMT, UCU, TSSA, NEU, CWU, NASUWT, PCS, FBU, Unite, Unison, GMB, RCN.\nWe’re working with the teaching unions to set up a teachers’ supply agency owned by the people it serves so supply teachers can get their pension rights and access to continuous professional development.\nAll the jobs we create are backed by our Good Work Pledge that we developed bringing unions and progressive businesses together. It guarantees the real living wage, an end to fire and rehire and zero-hours contracts, engages with the workforce through trade union recognition agreements, supports mental health at work, builds a diverse workforce, and trains employees to turn a job into a career.",

What’s not to like? As Jeremy Hunt himself said, “We have the one of the most expensive systems in the world.” About 80% of us have children at some point in our lives so it’s an issue that affects millions of people.\nBut is the announcement all it’s cracked up to be?\nLet’s start with the present day. The ‘30 hours free childcare’ message is everywhere – the Government’s spin machine is alive and well. Parents of 3-and-4-year-olds are already supposed to get it, provided both work at least 16 hours a week. But as a parent in my team explained, that’s not how it works in practice.\nNow, bear with me here – this gets complicated. He and his wife pay £435.20 a month for his 2-year-old to attend nursery 2 days a week (20 hours) – that’s £5,222 a year. They pay for it using the tax-free childcare system – basically a Government bank account. For every £100 they transfer to the account the Government tops it up by £20. So the £544 a month bill they get from the nursery is really £435.20.\nConfused? It gets worse. When his daughter turns 3 they become eligible for the ‘free’ scheme. That brings the initial nursery bill down to £320.27 a month which comes down further to £256.22 when paid for through the tax-free childcare scheme. So it will be £178.98 cheaper than it is now. But £256.22 a month or £3,074.64 a year is not ‘free’ by any definition of ‘free’ you’ll see in the dictionary\nWell done if you’ve followed that. It’s complicated.\nBut why is it so complicated? Accident or design? Only a third of families are eligible for tax-free childcare in the first place. And of that third, only half take up the offer. So that’s about one in six families benefit. So it’s not a massive surprise that in the four years the scheme has been running, the Government spent £2.3 billion less on tax-free childcare than it had planned.\nComplexity is our enemy. Simplicity is our friend. Make a scheme complicated and time-consuming to use and, hey presto, a lot of people won’t use it. Make it simple to navigate and they will.\nWhat are we trying to achieve?\nMost parents I speak to want a balance. Yes – they want to spend time with their kids as they grow up, particularly when they’re very little. But they want to work too. A system purely designed to get parents into full-time work is not one we should aspire to. Treating childcare simply as a business rather than a vital public service does not serve children and their families well.\nIt doesn’t serve nurseries well either. 4,000 providers closed down last year. Partly because the Government doesn’t fully pay them to deliver the ‘free’ offer. Nationally the gap between what the Government gives them and the true cost of delivering the ‘free’ hours is £1.82 billion. It forces them to charge higher fees for 1-and-2-year-olds. No one in the Treasury seems to have any idea what will happen when nurseries can’t do that anymore.\nBut childcare isn’t just about nurseries and nurseries aren’t just about childcare. Nurseries are about early years education too and we know that the first 1,000 days have a big impact on the rest of a child’s life. Too many children in the North East aren’t ready to start school when the time comes. So in the North of Tyne we’re funding 100 schools to provide extra help to kids in reception and those of pre-school age.\nWe’re also funding after school clubs in 22 schools because we know parents need that support now, not in 2026 when the Chancellor’s pledge on wraparound care is set to start.\nI had the opportunity to look after my boys full-time when they were younger. It was time well spent. Giving every parent the choices and opportunities that I had is what the childcare system should be all about.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_invest-to-save/content_206.html": "Invest to Save\nOctober 5, 2020\nBoilers on prescription might not sound like an obvious link to radical devolution. But it’s a strategy that GPs working with housing provider Gentoo implemented in Sunderland in 2016. And it worked.\nThe scheme allowed GPs to “prescribe” new, efficient boilers and home insulation to patients suffering respiratory conditions and living in damp, cold homes. It cost the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group £5,000 per home. But the savings and health benefits were remarkable. Residents saved around £125 annually on their fuel bills, removing some financial stress. Their bedrooms were 3 degrees warmer. GP appointments, which cost the NHS £100 each, fell by 60% and emergency hospital admissions – at £2,500 each – dropped by 25%. And, best of all, people were happier.\nIt’s intuitively obvious that a stitch in time saves nine. In the North East we have some of the best hospitals in the world. Yet we have the lowest life expectancy in England.\nHousing, income and transport all determine your health. If your work is insecure and you don’t know how much you’ll earn from week to week, the stress will take a toll on your health. If you can’t get to work or the shops on foot or by public transport, you’ll likely become dependent on your car.\nBut what’s the link to radical devolution?\nAndy Burnham, my counterpart in Manchester, has taken a joined-up approach in tackling homelessness. People who are street homeless typically have very complex needs. His “A Bed Every Night” policy provides people with a safe and stable place to stay, and wrap-around support. The local NHS Trust, the Police and the Probation Services all work together. Yes, this costs money up front – around £11,000 per person. But it results in fewer admissions to A&E, and fewer nights in the police cells. The savings? £24,000 per person.\nManchester can do this, because health and policing are all devolved to their Mayoral Combined Authority. But despite the evidence that pilot schemes like boilers on prescription work, they rarely get implemented at scale.\nOur country has seen ever greater fragmentation, outsourcing, and internal markets introduced. Services get contracted out to different firms. They’re only responsible for hitting their immediate targets. There’s no incentive to plan ahead, and no mechanism to recoup the savings if they did. The logic that free market competition will drive down prices doesn’t work with public services. It results in expensive duplication and administrative overheads. We don’t want our public services competing, we want them cooperating.\nPublic Health England’s latest data shows that three in ten adults are obese. This really matters. Obesity is a risk factor for chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, stroke and osteoarthritis. Around ten per cent of the annual NHS budget is spent on diabetes-related treatment alone. Childhood obesity is rising too. By 2050, it’s estimated that obesity will cost the UK £49.9 billion per year.\nThere’s a limit to what can be achieved with more leaflets or taxes on sugary drinks. It needs system change.\nI’d like to see a public transport system that’s so cheap and reliable that people leave their cars at home. An extra ten minutes walk each way to work uses enough calories to lose half a stone in a year.\nWhen poor employers pay low wages, they’re shunting the costs to us, the tax payer. Their workers’ health suffers along the way. A Good Work Pledge with a Real Living Wage saves us all money in the long run.\nI’ve been lobbying government to adopt this Invest To Save approach for the North of Tyne’s next wave of devolution. Westminster is too remote for effective joined up policies. Rather than central government using our money to patch-up avoidable problems, I want to invest upfront and prevent them. It’s far more cost effective than the false economy of austerity.\nOur society needs to start counting the true cost of our policies. Allowing regional governments to invest and improve people’s lives today will save money tomorrow. We’ll be healthier, more productive and happier.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 5.10.20",

Today it’s Kensington and Chelsea in London. But 150 years ago Newcastle was in with a shout.\nOur mineral wealth was renowned. The home of the locomotive, the birthplace of the railways, supplier of ships to the world. The place where renewable energy, turbine power and the electric light were invented. For two centuries the North East fuelled the industrial revolution and made Britain the workshop of the world. Just a hundred years ago, we were wealthier, per person, than the South East, South West, Midlands or Yorkshire.\nSo what went wrong?\nWell the Government stopped investing in the North East. In businesses, in infrastructure, in people. The North East’s wealth plummeted from 93% of the UK average in 1981 to 73% by 2017. No other English region has declined so fast.\nThe answers to the economic problems of the North East lie in generating more wealth here. Do that and we reduce health inequality and skills inequality. Everyone benefits. Everyone gets richer.\nWe do that with more devolution.\nThat’s the case I made in the House of Lords last week with the 2070 commission.\nChaired by Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, it looks at how we should change things over the next 50 years, not just the next 5. Successful regional development takes longer than one political cycle. Longer than one Prime Minister. Certainly longer than a lettuce.\nIt requires the region to be in driving seat, not the Government in Westminster.\nThat’s also the message of the Gordon Brown constitutional commission that gets launched on Monday. Gordon asked me to keep the details quiet until it’s launched, but it covers two broad themes: restoring trust in politics, and boosting regional wealth. That’s two sides of the same coin.\nReplacing the House of Lords with an elected senate of the nations and regions will grab the headlines. But it includes solid proposals to clean up politics. Banning second jobs for MPs. Letting citizens juries adjudicate on political corruption instead of political insiders. That’s real people power.\nI worked with Gordon and his team on the economic proposals in the report. How we generate wealth in places like the North East. How we make sure that wealth finds its way into the pockets of working people here and not billionaires’ accounts offshore.\nThat means powers to help everyone earn more. Small businesses, self-employed people, full-time workers, part-time workers. It means better child-care provision. It means devolving the careers service and Job Centres, so the whole system works to help people get better jobs, and not punish them for being unemployed. It means giving us the tools to boost our green industries.\nGiving more powers and money to the regions produces better results. We’ve shown that over the last 3 and half years at the North of Tyne.\nWe took control of adult education 2 years ago. Training for chefs, and welders, and computer skills for adults. Right in the middle of the pandemic. It’s hard to imagine a worse time to take on something new. Yet we did it and got more bang for our buck. Before we controlled it there were 21,885 enrolments on a course per year. Last year we had 32,769 – a 50% increase. For the same budget. With 96% of people who enrolled completing their course and getting a qualification.\nA 50% increase in value for money.\nImagine what we could do with transport, housing, and infrastructure. Cutting fares and bringing in integrated ticketing so you can take a bike, bus and metro with a single pass for the entire journey. Retrofitting homes, cutting carbon emissions, and bringing down energy bills so that everyone has a warm home to live in. Seeing new light rail links built in years instead of decades.\nDoing all of this from a single pot of money. Trusting us to spend it well.\nTrying to do it from 280 miles away just doesn’t work anymore. If it ever did. What seemed like a good idea thought up by a minister or civil servant in Whitehall struggles when it makes contact with the ground.\nThe North East is a wonderful place to live. The people are friendly and hard working. The landscape is beautiful, our heritage impressive. We have world-leading industries.\nGive us the tools to generate wealth and remove inequality and we’ll be soaring once more.",

Whether it’s sport, comedy or plays. I’m endlessly impressed watching the skills that have been honed over thousands of hours. And the joy and passion at performers’ self-expression. I love seeing people learning their trade, too. Supporting up and coming talent.\nEdinburgh Fringe has all that in spades. It’s the tapas of live entertainment. Lots of little portions which add up make a satisfying meal. We also ate actual tapas! I’ve spent the last few days there with my family, and am writing my column on the train back.\nNelson, my younger son, is learning the guitar. His choice was “When Judas Met John.” Two brothers performing and comparing the songs of Bob Dylan and John Lennon. The lad’s got good taste – I raised him well! The similarity between Norwegian Wood and 4th Time Around is obvious.\nNow fifteen, my older son Leon liked Stand Up Philosophy. Philosophy teacher turned comedian Alex Farrow hosts stand-ups, and the audience quiz them on their material. Sitting in the front row, I got asked my occupation. I always answer questions honestly, “I’m a politician.” Groans and jeers from the audience. “What kind of politician?” “A socialist politician.” That got a more positive response. “What’s your name?” Someone in the Edinburgh audience had heard of me, and I got a whoop.\nThis led to banter between the comedians on the nature of democracy, online radicalisation, and a heckle from someone. “Democracy will never work in the West. 95% of the wealth is owned by 5% of the people.”\n“If only,” said Alex, “there was a political philosophy that tackles wealth inequality,” gesturing to me, and taking the session full circle. You can’t beat live entertainment.\nThe act that will stick with me is Paddy The Cope. A first-person storytelling of working class hero Patrick Gallagher, founder of the co-op in Donegal. Accompanied by a fiddler, it took us on the journey of shale mining, love lost and found, oppression by the usury merchants, and the way a community fought back to gain some measure of economic democracy.\nStorytelling defines a culture. I’ve heard it said that Scots and Welsh devolution is more advanced because of a stronger cultural identity. Perhaps it’s time we invested in telling our stories of the North East, old and new.\nThe Netflix model is to get the whole world seeing the same shows. But the local variety is what gives entertainment its richness and allows youngsters to imagine what they are capable of. Don’t get me wrong – there’s some good stuff on Netflix. But the money we pay Netflix or Sky leaves our region.\nThe Fringe shows the power of having a cultural centre to a city’s calendar. It’s a staging post for launching other activity. It attracts talented performers. It makes this a better place to live. It’s about the most cost-effective advert a city or region can have.\nWe don’t want to cut and paste. What works for Edinburgh might not work for us. We have a solid base to build on. Just the week before, we watched the Handlebards perform Macbeth in the grounds of Hexham Abbey. In the rain. The Stand Comedy Club is hosting live gigs again. And I hope to support the Newcastle Improv Festival in coming years.\nThis is the focus of our Culture, Creativity and Tourism work. It’s not just about staging one-off events. It’s about investing in the content creators and supply chain companies. Performers and writers, yes. And everything from make-up artists to lighting riggers. Jobs people really want to do. No alienation of labour here. Providing a support network for creatives to grow sustainably and still be around in 10 years’ time.\nThe gig-economy gets its name from the culture and creative industry. The risk puts many people off following their passion. Especially kids from working-class backgrounds, who can’t rely on financial support from parents. Predictable work is the bedrock of flourishing creative and cultural industries. Any industry in fact!\nHopefully in the not too distant future when asked where best to go for live entertainment, people will say “right here in the North East”.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 23 August 2021",

I’m on the shortlist as the possible Labour candidate for North of Tyne Mayor.\nI’m a grassroots activist. I worked on both of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaigns.\nThis is one of the Metro-Mayor deals. It’s not about running the bin collections or managing social services. It’s a new role: economic development.\nIt doesn’t have much money – £20mn a year doesn’t even dent the cuts to public services. This was a Tory deal, after all.\nBut it does have something important. The Tories designed these Metro Mayor deals with a swashbuckling businessman in mind, cutting through red tape and crushing local planning objections. When I read the devolution document, it occurred to me that its authors never thought a socialist like me would get hold of this position. So I’m standing on a radical socialist platform against Labour establishment candidates.\nUnder the Localism Act of 2011, the Mayor has the power to do anything an individual can do. We can establish a People’s Bank. We can build community housing cooperatives. We can create a green energy company. And they can all be collectively owned.\nWe have to leave behind the New Labour ideology of taming capitalism. Capitalism is a rigged system that is long past its sell-by date. It squanders human talent and wrecks our environment.\nA People’s bank would be cooperatively owned, one-member-one-vote. It cannot be privatised. It will offer a full range of services – current accounts, savings accounts, mortgages and business banking for local firms. It’ll take us a couple of years to complete the regulatory process. This changes the rigged system – the banks are one of the biggest extractors of wealth from our economy. By keeping the profits reinvested locally, we can support local & worker owned businesses.\nCommunity housing cooperatives are social housing. Built to a high standard, with eco-friendly construction methods, they’re great places to live. Crucially, they are not owned by the state. They are owned collectively by the people who live there. So they are exempt from right-to-buy legislation. We can have fair-rent, socially-owned housing now. The profits can fund local community projects and maintain green spaces.\nIn Nottingham the local authority already owns Robin Hood energy. In the North of Tyne, we can establish an energy provider owned by its workers and customers. The Tories have slashed green energy subsidies, so we’ll have to grow it slowly. But we’ll have wind and solar power, and can supplement it with micro-hydro electric power from the region’s mountains.\nThis works because we’re already spending money on these things. Instead local wealth being siphoned off into the tax-havens of billionaires, we keep it in our communities. This means higher wages and more jobs. More worker-owned businesses. This means more spending power, which supports more jobs. And so the cycle continues.\nAdd into this the Community Wealth Building strategy that’s made Preston the most improved city in the UK, and we can start something special.\nI’ve already got the support of the majority of local Labour Parties and the majority of unions. Socialist MPs like John McDonnell, Laura Pidcock and Clive Lewis are backing me. I want your help to become the first socialist Mayor of the North of Tyne. Please share my social media posts, donate to my campaign, and if you know any Labour members in the area, tell them to vote for me in the selection ballot. The Labour selection ends on the 18th of February. All the information is on www.JD4Mayor.com.\nThe public election is in May. In less than four months we could have an arm of the state putting socialist policies into practice.\nIf I’m elected Mayor, I won’t be able to end arms sales. Or renationalise the railways. Or scrap tuition fees.\nWhat I will do is plant the seeds for the economy to come.",

Such as providing workplace learning opportunities through the Union Learn programme. The view of trade unions as “the enemy within” and wreckers of the economy is obsolete. It’s a far cry from the reality. When employers work with trade unions, whether in the public or private sector, it’s a constructive partnership.\nLittle known to the general public, since 1998 the trade unions have built a network of 40,000 volunteer Union Learning Reps (ULRs). It’s a national scheme, with public funding. Workplace reps talk workers through opportunities for training and adult education courses. Too often, people don’t realise they have unfulfilled potential. Or just aren’t aware of the possibilities on offer. Sometimes they think their boss won’t support them to skill-up.\nThe Union Learning Reps help overcome all these problems. Because they’re in the workplace, known and trusted by co-workers, the ULRs can help some of those hardest to reach. People in “left behind” places and unglamorous jobs have transformed their working lives. Over the past 23 years the ULRs guided over 200,000 workers to gain qualifications in English, maths and IT skills. Often their first ever qualification. It put them on the path to further learning and on a route to a better paid career.\nULRs are volunteers. That network of 40,000 reps helping their co-workers depends on the back-up of full-time support workers. In March this year, Government axed the funding. Union Learn was to end. The volunteers abandoned, the scheme binned. It was a crass decision, even by the standards we’ve seen. And short-sighted. Recovery from Covid requires a skilled workforce.\nBut it’s not my style to idly fulminate at the Government. Rather than shout from the sidelines, I used my remit as Mayor to make Union Learn even better and transform it for the post-Covid era.\nIn the North of Tyne, 18% of our residents hold low or no qualifications. Trapped in low paid roles and denied opportunities for progression. It’s no accident, then, that 23% of our working population earn less than the Real Living Wage.\nUnion Learn isn’t just about the workers. Employers benefit. Better trained staff are more and productive. The economy benefits. Greater tax receipts and national insurance contributions. A higher skilled workforce supports more productive businesses. Research from the University of Exeter showed that £1 invested in Union Learn creates £12.87 economic benefit. A win-win all round.\nSo although most of the country will be losing Union Learn, last week I launched our initial two-year replacement. We’ve partnered with the Northern TUC and our local authority colleagues. Backed by £430,000 from our Investment Fund, the TUC-administered project will employ a regional Union Learn coordinator and three full-time Union Learn reps. This is stronger than before. They’ll work with employers in our key sectors to champion opportunities for workplace learning. They’ll pilot new ways to help more workers skill-up, in a wider range of workplaces. It will transform more lives.\nI value the role our trade unions play in creating a fairer and greener economy. I’ve worked with them since becoming Mayor. I have trade union representation on our advisory boards and regular dialogue through our forum with regional union secretaries. We’re working with the teaching unions to set up a cooperative supply agency to combat zero-hours working. And for accreditation to the advanced level of our Good Work Pledge, employers need to have a trade union recognition agreement in place. Unionised workplaces are more productive, safer, and have lower staff turnover.\nOur Union Learn Project exemplifies what we can achieve through collaboration. It’s a solid investment in good work and building a fairer economy. Best of all, it’ll make a concrete difference to low-paid workers’ lives. Building confidence and putting money in their pockets.\nIt’s also an example of how agile the North of Tyne Combined Authority is. Rather than distant targets or “aspirations”, we’ve fixed a problem within a few months. That’s why I went into politics.

The last one was in 1965, for Winston Churchill. They’re a time for national reflection – about the country we want to be as well as remembering the country we were. And of course, the person who’s passed away. May Queen Elizabeth II rest in peace.\nBritain is a constitutional monarchy, not an absolute one. We haven’t had a king or queen exercise real political power since William IV dismissed Lord Melbourne as Prime Minister in 1834 and appointed Robert Peel against the will of Parliament. We’ve evolved into a democracy where our (unwritten) constitution says Parliament is sovereign, not the king. If we want to change the way we run our country we can.\nMany people want to keep the institution of the monarchy. They’re entitled to want it. Others want a republic – they’re entitled to their opinion too. Our democracy should be strong enough for both groups to be able to express their views. Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right. No one should be arrested for holding up a piece of paper. That people have been detained for peacefully expressing republican views is disgraceful.\nAll social change comes from people making a nuisance of themselves. Without the suffragettes women wouldn’t have won the right to vote in 1918. Without the civil rights movement in America the Civil Rights Act wouldn’t have outlawed racist discrimination in 1964. Without the anti-apartheid movement Nelson Mandela wouldn’t have been released from prison in 1990 and have become South Africa’s first democratically-elected President in 1994.\nOur country’s shape has changed dramatically over the past few centuries. The Queen’s father was Emperor of India until 1947. The last big British colony – Hong Kong – was only handed back to China in 1997. The UK’s current borders are only 100 years old – when Southern Ireland left the UK to become the Republic of Ireland in 1922. The United Kingdom exists today by consent. We recognised that Scotland had the right to secede in the independence referendum in 2014. The people of Scotland chose to stay.\nThe power vested in the UK’s head of state is minimal compared to, say, the US or French presidents. The pomp and protocol involved are memorable – I attended Tyne & Wear’s proclamation ceremony. But if we elected a head of state, it would imbue the role with a democratic mandate to govern. So while I understand the republican case, I’d call for more urgent changes to our constitution.\nI’d like to see the House of Commons better reflects the will of the people. The UK is the only country in Europe to use first-past-the-post to elect MPs, with the exception of Belarus. If and when the UK finally moves to proportional representation, we need to keep a strong constituency link, and not have it dominated by party lists.\nWe need to replace the House of Lords too. That 750 people nobody elected decide on our laws is medieval. Hereditary peers are there because their father was a duke, marquess, viscount or baron. Life peers were chosen by a leader of a political party. No other democracy on Earth has such an arcane system. Let’s replace it with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions, to serve as a proper check and balance on the Commons and the Government.\nAbove all, make devolution real. Transfer powers from Westminster and Whitehall to our nations, regions, cities, towns and villages. Despite the rise of metro mayors we remain one of the most centralised countries in the world. Over 95% of the tax raised in the North is spent by Westminster. Only 5% is spent by branches of government based in the North. We have a system where the new king can be proclaimed in ceremonies across Newcastle, Gateshead, Durham, Morpeth, North Shields, South Shields and Sunderland but where his citizens hear about the main tax and spend decisions affecting their lives when the Chancellor delivers his budget in SW1. The only way to level up the North is to take power out of London.\nIf the United Kingdom is to stay together for the next 70 years it’s going to have to change. It always has.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 19 Sept 2022",

They are the precursor to our future society. Kids rub shoulders with other kids and learn what’s socially acceptable. Their expectations about life can be challenged – or reinforced. No wonder parents are so keen to get kids into a “good” school.\nIt follows, then, that if we want to eliminate poverty from our society, the school gates are a good place to start.\nAbout a year ago I was talking to a government minister. “The way to create jobs long term,” he said, “is to increase research and development.”\n“We do need more research and development investment here,” I said, “But those jobs of the future won’t go to the kids who are too hungry to learn in school today.”\nOn the basis of that conversation, I negotiated with ministers, including the Education secretary, and got Child Poverty Prevention included in the new North East devolution deal. Ours is the only devolution deal that directly tackles the issue.\nIt’s based on our existing North of Tyne Child Poverty Prevention Programme, which we’ve just agreed to expand at our last cabinet meeting. After May 2024, we’ll be able to extend it across the North East, helping kids and families in Durham, Sunderland, South Tyneside and Gateshead.\nPoverty is messy. Families have to choose between sanitary products or topping up an extortionate pre-pay meter. Between paying for the bus or buying food and nappies. The stress parents feel of not being able to buy nice things for kids birthdays and Christmas, when we’re all bombarded by adverts. The insecurity of knowing how many hours you’ll be able to work next week. And the grinding mental stress that affects relationships.\nThe long term solution to poverty is to get everyone a secure, well-paid job. And we’re on with that. Literally thousands of families have a higher income because of the economic development work we’ve done. But child poverty needs action right now.\nThat’s why last year our Child Poverty Prevention Programme took effect. We’re on track to directly support at least 1,600 kids by the end of July. We’ve worked with almost 90 schools, and have signed off funding to support another 50 schools next academic year.\nCragside Primary School is one I’ve visited. My team and I were blown away by headteacher Becky Jackson and her staff – their tireless efforts to build a better life for these kids. They told me why, for example, they shelved World Book Day. Because of the enormous pressure it puts on struggling families to spend money they don’t have on novelty costumes their child will only wear for one day of the year. Instead, children were encouraged to share their favourite books with each other. Staff arranged for much-loved authors to visit the classrooms.\nFor families in poverty, financial burdens take many forms. And sometimes small, simple steps can help to take off some of the pressure. When Cragside teachers clocked that the kids were trying to outdo each other by turning up to P.E. in the latest football shirts, they introduced a plain kit for everyone to wear. An instant leveller.\nThere’s more. Struggling families can buy cheap, second-hand school uniforms from the school. The buying is important here, Becky explained. There is a dignity in purchasing a bargain that is lost when receiving a free ‘handout’. Cragside offers foodbank vouchers, coffee mornings, and welfare advice, on site – meeting the parents where they are.\nI asked Becky and her team about their experience of working with us. “It’s been a really great project. We’ve had really great feedback from families,” said deputy head Lucy. It’s heartening to know – and backs up what we’ve been hearing elsewhere too. Our Child Poverty Prevention Programme is currently cited as an example of best practice in the country.\nAs we walked its colourful corridors and classrooms, Cragside hummed with energy. It was, as all schools should be, a crucible of curiosity. A special place where friendships are forged, discoveries are made, and children not only learn but learn to love learning.\nA microcosm of the kind of world I think we’d all like to live in.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_its-about-jobs-stupid/content_251.html": "It’s About Jobs, Stupid\nAugust 1, 2021\nWhat does “levelling-up” mean to you? Getting more investment into the North of England? Closing the life-expectancy gap, perhaps? Reversing the historic under-funding of the North’s transport infrastructure?\nI’d hoped the Prime Minister’s much-trailed speech on levelling-up would define it. His 32-minute speech, his “Vision to Level up the United Kingdom”, covered everything from football pitches to bus stops, via a detour into chewing gum on pavements. At one point he said if anyone can think of a better idea, send me an email. I imagined his speech writers face-palming in the wings.\nThe commentariat were scathing. An “everything and nothing policy” according to the chair of Parliament’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee.\nBack in October 2020 I gave evidence to that Parliamentary committee. I talked about the need for Government clarity on levelling-up. How it would be put in to practice in regions such as ours. I spoke of the need to give the North control over our own wealth creation. The powers to turbocharge our ability to create good jobs. Nearly a year down the line and the Government’s levelling-up plans remain as opaque as ever.\nLevelling-up is a catch-all phrase designed for electioneering. Mr Johnson keeps it deliberately vague – that way he can never fail to achieve it. Come election time, he’ll claim it a success, regardless of the fact that all of the money earmarked for Northern Powerhouse Rail – to connect Northern cities – is being squandered on HS2. It’s notable the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP), due out last year, then January, then Easter, then in July, has been pushed back again. It seems the IRP is Samuel Beckett’s much anticipated sequel to Waiting for Godot.\nProgressive patriotism is another vapid slogan. It’s all about branding, I’m told. We have to “position ourselves”. You need to raise your profile. I hear it all the time in political circles. Well, if I’d wanted to repeat catch-phrases, I’d have become a game show host. I became Mayor to fix things.\nAnd I love my job as Mayor. Last week I signed off two more investments to create highly paid jobs in the software industry. I’ll not steal the thunder of the companies’ own announcements and name them, but they’re 100 and 94 jobs respectively.\nI may have started the article criticising the PM’s speech, but so did many in his own party. But once you’re in government, as I am, that means building partnerships to get things delivered. The electorate expect us to work together to fix things.\nAt Tuesday’s North of Tyne Cabinet for example, we agreed an allocation of £7 million to develop 5G and future connectivity programme. This positions us at the forefront of new technology investments. Developing test facilities and business cases to secure even more high-tech jobs and facilitate lower-carbon living.\nAt the same cabinet meeting we approved our Digital Development Cluster, to create 182 jobs, and the Talent Engine with Dynamo creating another 150. We agreed funding of £1 million to support “Town and High Street” recovery innovation projects across our three local authorities.\nAnd we’re working with New Writing North to bring publishing houses to the disused buildings in Clayton Street in Newcastle. These investments will bring new jobs in addition to the 4,193 jobs already in place or in the pipeline.\nJob creation is an art – there’s lots of ingredients go into the recipe. I’ve been working with BritishVolt since last year, along with our partners in Northumberland who’ve sorted the land deal. Last Tuesday, they broke ground on the new electric-vehicle battery gigafactory. That’s another 3000 jobs on top of the 4,193 already in the pipeline. There’s another 5000 in the BritishVolt supply chain. We’ll be working to develop the skills programme to bring those jobs here – which we can do, because the skills budget has been devolved to the North of Tyne. Along with transport and digital infrastructure, investment in training and eduction is a key enabler of job creation.\nSo what does levelling-up mean to me? If I can paraphrase Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, “It’s about jobs, stupid.” Because that’s what levelling-up is all about: creating well paid, secure jobs, so everyone has a future.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 02 August 2021",

No matter how good your internet connection or webcam is, it’s still not the same. Maybe The Matrix has raised our expectations.\nWorkers in the cultural sector have again shown their creativity and resilience. Online shows, workshops, musical performances from bedrooms. Innovative styles like the self-selecting ’front row’ of an online comedy gig. It gives the comedian real interaction with at least some of the audience. There are also advantages in inclusivity for people who find it difficult physically getting to events. They might live out in the sticks, or have limited mobility\n.Some forms of entertainment translate better than others. The connection with the crowd isn’t there online. Singing the Blaydon Races or Wise Men Say in front of your living room telly is nothing like adding your voice to thousands of fellow fans. Part of the human condition is enjoying being together. Well, some of the time.\nLast week I had a meeting with Minister Caroline Dinenage and Lord Neil Mendoza to discuss cultural recovery and levelling up. The Cultural Levelling Up Fund has given a lifeline to some of our local venues like Alphabetti, Liberdaje, and the Tyne Theatre and Opera House. But there is a long way to go. It was great to hear Lord Mendoza say he’d take up the challenge to show culture can contribute to levelling up. I’ll continue to push.\nBefore becoming Mayor I was Councillor for Monument ward which covers Newcastle City Centre. I’d often meet with businesses to discuss the future of the City Centre. The trend of working from home and shopping online was already happening. Like King Canute (or is it Cnut – need to be careful with that spelling!), we can’t hold back the tide. The trickle has become a torrent.\nNext week I’m meeting Minister Paul Scully about re-opening cities. The government want to discuss how to get people back into offices and shops. We need to be thinking further ahead than that. Shops and office space are going to change. We’ve already seen some big names from the high street disappear. Reimagining the future of Britain’s city centres is now urgent.\nIn Newcastle we have two universities, a football stadium and a hospital to build a vision around. And people will always want a nexus of pubs, bars and clubs to socialise in. The transport network is focused on city centres, so they’re easy to reach. Cultural venues are well placed there to take advantage of the transport links and plug into the social scene.\nHow should we reimagine our city centre? A focus on public spaces so people can gather in a pleasant environment has to be part of it. More green spaces that show off the beautiful architecture. Flexible meeting rooms for when ‘working-from-homers’ need to meet in person. Spaces for community groups to convene. My kids love meeting their mates to play games. I’d be interested in hearing your ideas, so do get in touch via the North of Tyne website.\nOur Citizen’s Assembly starts next week. We’ve been busy making sure all the participants have the kit and skills they need to join in. If they don’t have a computer, we’re lending them a laptop. We’ve worked hard to make sure they come from a diverse range of backgrounds, ages, geographies and also different views on climate change.\nOne gentleman has been isolating all throughout the pandemic and was thrilled when we got the Zoom connection up and running. He’d never used Zoom before. “I can see you!” He was blown away that we wanted to hear his opinion and is excited about taking part. Many other participants have said how chuffed they are that we’re asking their opinion, saying they’ve never been asked before.\nThat is the power of connection. Whether in the physical realm or the virtual. Digital may not be real life, but it can make a real difference. We’ve all experienced upheavals and changing patterns of activity over the past year. We need to identify the good bits we want to keep and embrace them\nPublished Originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 22.2.21",

Nine tenths of it is out of sight, certainly as far as the news goes. Two stories dominate right now.\nFirst, it turns out our Prime Minister did break lots of lockdown rules. What, really? I’m shocked!\nYou’ve already made you mind up as to whether the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a lying criminal without a shred of honour – or an honest upstanding gentleman of impeccable virtue who we’re lucky to have shepherding us through these troubled times. You might even think he is 100% focused on running the country, and not spending all his time wriggling around like a greased piglet in a desperate attempt to salvage his career. Nothing I write will change your opinion.\nThe second story is the windfall tax. Sorry – the “temporary targeted energy profits levy”. Heaven forbid that the Chancellor should acknowledge that he’s implementing the exact policy Labour has campaigned for.\nIt’s a good policy. We’re funding their megaprofits through our bills. The price of energy to wash our clothes and cook our meals has skyrocketed. The new policy will genuinely help people in dire need. Well done Mr Sunak.\nBut why did it take nearly six months to implement? Too often in politics point scoring gets in the way of good governance. If it’s a good policy, do it, regardless of whose idea it was.\nWin-win is a bit of cliché, but it’s true. It’s how I approach the job of Mayor. I’m only successful if the people I work with are successful. In the past fortnight I’ve had over a dozen key meetings with business and political leaders, to land investment in our region.\nA week last Tuesday I was in Leeds for UKREiiF – a large investment conference. I spoke on a panel with my fellow Metro Mayors, reinforcing each other’s position on getting more investment to the North. I also spoke to ethical fund managers about financing genuinely affordable housing here.\nI met with Investment Minister Lord Grimstone. The Offshore Testing facility in Blyth missed out on £30 million of investment in the last spending round. Unless the UK invests in research and development, industry will invest abroad. He agreed with me. What’s good for Blyth is good for Britain. A win-win.\nThursday I was in Leeds again. The public part was a photo-op on a bus. I find these things a bit cheesy. But the meeting with my fellow Mayors, Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy was useful. Labour has been out of power nationally for twelve years. Our Metro Mayors show that economic competence and compassionate policies can go hand in hand.\nAnd on that, I met with Gordon Brown and his team on Wednesday. They’ve been working up Labour’s Constitutional Commission. It’s not finalised, so forgive me for being vague, but I was genuinely impressed with its scope and depth. It really does address some of the imbalances in Britain’s economy and decision making. Who knows when the next election is, but working with a Labour government could turbocharge the work we’re doing in the North of Tyne.\nThe North East leads on battery technology, building two new gigafactories, bringing thousands of new jobs. But government investment in the training facilities has historically gone to the West Midlands. Last Friday I met with the North East Battery Alliance and BritishVolt, to scope a joint project for training facilities here.\nThe Parliamentary Adult Education Bill includes a national register of adult education providers. Local firms won’t be able to run work-related training courses. Last Monday I met with Education Secretary last Nadhim Zahawi, asking him to allow Mayoral Combined Authorities to accredit providers. After all, we already have robust due diligence. “I can see it would make life easier for you, and for us,” he said. Again, the win-win.\nI’m meeting him again to discuss school age education – one of the government’s “levelling up” missions. There’s benefit in allowing our local education teams more control and flexibility. Greater Manchester are also negotiating additional devolution around this, so Andy Burnham and I are supporting each other.\nYou’ll be aware we’re negotiating with government for a bigger Mayoral Combined Authority here in the North East. For the past three years I’ve been working with the leaders of our local authorities to arrive at a joint “ask”.\nWe want new, expanded region to get at least as much funding per capita that we get for the North of Tyne. It’s already the highest per capita devolution deal, so government are reluctant to scale it up.\nAt the moment, capital expenditure for the Tyne & Wear Metro comes from central government – as it should. We want the Metro this to continue, and not have the Metro eat up the new devolved transport money.\nLast week I met Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and pressed the case on Metro funding. On Wednesday I met Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, and discussed the total amount of funding we’d need to make any deal acceptable. I’ll be discussing the details with my fellow local leaders before publishing it here, but suffice to say both ministers see the benefits of a win-win.\nGetting hot and confrontational is the best way to get the headlines. Getting the job done means staying cool. So like an iceberg, most politics happens below the surface.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 30 May 22",

Despite getting 25,018 votes in Newcastle three weeks ago, and lots of people encouraging me, I will not be standing in this snap General Election. Instead, I will be building a movement to change things long-term.\nThe General Election coverage has already descended into trivia. Ooh, look, Rishi Sunak got wet. Keir Starmer keeps saying “change” a lot – what does that mean? Almost no journalists are asking how either of them will improve the lives of the working people of Britain.\nOur two-party system and first-past-the-post makes the result a foregone conclusion. Successive Conservative Governments have heightened wealth inequality, corroded our public services, and fiddled while the planet burns. Very few Tories want to defend that record. Keir Starmer will be Prime Minster.\nWhat comes next is also a foregone conclusion. Deemed a safe pair of hands by the establishment, Sir Keir and those around him will continue failed Conservative economic policies. When it comes out, Labour’s manifesto should be called “Tinkering around the edges”.\nSo how do we effect democratic change?\nLabour’s plan to fix nothing will quickly lose popularity. Next May, Northumberland and Durham have all-out council elections. May 2026 will see all-out elections in Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, and South Tyneside, and council elections in North Tyneside. Then May 2028 is the North East Mayoral election. Even under first past the post we can win these. And build for the next General Election.\nSo I will be building a network of North East independents.\nPeople committed to democratic accountability, high standards in public life, and putting working people first. Including those not paid for their work, unable to work or retired from a lifetime of work.\nThis project will empower people with the strategies and skills to win elections. How to develop a popular, deliverable programme. Communicating with impact. Building support in your community. And organising to get elected. It’s for campaigners as well as candidates. People who want to be involved in different ways.\nThis is how we build a narrative in defiance of the banality of the mainstream media.

The point is to make him see that there is no objective truth other than what Big Brother says is true. To give up on truth altogether.\nGood citizens were exhorted to train their minds to only think well of the government. “Crimestop” as Orwell described it, “includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity.”\nOn the outside wall were the three slogans of the Party: “WAR IS PEACE,” “FREEDOM IS SLAVERY,” and “IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\nLet’s add “CORRUPTION IS INTEGRITY.” It is the world of the three word slogan and the abusive Tweet. But don’t despair – there is such a thing as truth. And it comes out eventually.\nTory MP Owen Patterson received over £100,000 a year on top of his MP’s salary, to lobby ministers for Randox, and Lynn’s Country Foods. He was investigated, given appeals, and represented by his lawyers. He was still found guilty of breaking lobbying rules.\nWhen the vote to suspend him came before Parliament, the PM and the Tory whips closed ranks to change the system. The Government won the vote. MPs would now regulate themselves. Ministers started a briefing campaign against the Standards Commissioner. MPs were briefed to say Paterson’s treatment was unfair. Poor Mr Paterson was the victim all along. Two plus two equals five.\nUntil the following day, when the weight of truth forced a U-turn.\nHere’s a simple moral truth. The culture of MPs having a second job is wrong. If you can’t manage on £81,932 a year, then don’t run as an MP. Despite getting £520 an hour from Randox, Paterson voted to cut Universal Credit by £20 a week. And voted against giving kids free school meals through the holidays.\nThat a corrupt politician got caught isn’t the big story. In just the past year Robert Jenrick accepted a donation of £12,000 after letting property developer Richard Desmond off a £45 million bill. Oil firms who donated £419,000 to the Tory Party won oil exploration licenses in British waters – in the middle of a climate emergency. And Matt Hanckock’s mates got £millions in PPE contracts during the pandemic via a private WhatsApp group.\nThe bigger story is that Tory MPs closed ranks to change the definition of wrongdoing.\nBlyth’s Ian Levy voted in favour. As did Durham MPs Dehenna Davison, Richard Holden and Paul Howell. The Government whips were twisting arms and threatening reprisals. But custodians of democracy have a duty to put the public good ahead of their political career. As Orwell wrote, “It is quite possible that we are descending into an age in which two plus two will make five when the Leader says so.”\nBut let’s not be lazy and give into “crimestop”. Not all MPs are the same. Labour MPs voted against. Some Tories abstained, including Junior Minister Guy Opperman and Cabinet Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan. For ministers to defy a three-line whip is significant.\nMr Johnson wants to change the rules because there’s a skip full of corruption waiting to be investigated.\nThe PM used a £25,000 a week holiday villa – and made the owner a Life Peer. He took a £200,000 donation to revamp his flat with gold wallpaper. Last week he took a personal jet – which we paid for – from Glasgow to meet with his old pals at London’s Garrick club to save his old mate Owen Paterson. Not a small jet, mind, but an Airbus A321 that normally carries 196 passengers.\nWhat’s the media and commentariat response? “Ooh, he might lose some popularity in the polls.” If we had better political journalism in this country, they’d be asking, “How do we prevent this from happening again?”\nThere is an offence called Misconduct in Public Office. It’s a centuries old law that’s so ill-defined it’s not much use for prosecuting corrupt politicians. Last December, the Law Commission recommended replacing it with a specific offence of “Corruption in Public Office.”\nIt’s about time we cleaned up politics. The corrupt should stand trial.

They are millionaires.\nThe scandal isn’t that a career psychopath broke the rules (David Cameron’s description of Cummings). The scandal is that the entire cabinet is being wheeled out to defend him. Every other public official caught breaking the law had to resign for potentially spreading a fatal disease.\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Leader of the House Jacob Rees Mogg, and Foreign Sec and deputy PM Dominic Raab among them. All following the no 10 script.\nIn two hours they all used the words “care” and “child” in their tweets. Almost as if a single press officer had written them. (Then dutifully retweeted by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.)\nChancellor Rishi Sunak’s was the most toddleresque – accusing people of “trying to score political points” – I not naughty, you naughty!\nIt’s total bull, of course. Cummings doesn’t think rules apply to him. He thinks everyone else is too stupid to have an opinion. He says so in his blog. Worse still, their story isn’t straight. Eye witnesses and the police have disproven them. Toddler excuses and toddler lies.\nThe science of psychology has proven that toddlers have no ‘theory of mind’. Simply, they are not capable of realising that we might have different beliefs and opinions from them. We forgive toddlers because we know they will grow up.\nWith the Cabinet, we all knew they were lying. They knew they were lying. Why did they think they could get away with it? We’ve seen a catalogue of errors and lies about the handling of this crisis. When we look at the catalogue of failures we can see why. The worst death rate in Europe. Bungled PPE deliveries. Testing regimes not in place. Deciding to quarantine air passengers eight weeks after imposing a lockdown. We been misled on PPE. On testing. On statistics. On what the science said. So why stop there? In for a penny, in for a pound. After all, it worked when they deceived the Queen on proroguing Parliament.\nThey no longer tell you what’s true. They tell you what’s plausible. Most people think propaganda is about spin & exaggeration. It often was. But emboldened by Trump, some realised that a complete fiction was more effective. Sure, some serious people would never believe you again. But they’d never vote for you anyway.\nHannah Arendt, philosopher who escaped from Nazi Germany, wrote, “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction no longer exist.”\nFar better to make it a slanging match. To destroy truth altogether. When people start thinking everybody lies, they’ll go along with the loudest voice or the funniest clown.\nThere’s a platitude in politics that we’re all trying to do good, just we have different views of how to get there. It’s not really true – there are many different visions of the world we want to see. Grown-up politicians are comfortable debating it, based on evidence and values.\nNot all the Tories are toddlers. I deal with some who, in a private conversation, will admit things are not going as planned. It’s much less adversarial than you might think. Being in government is hard work. I approach these meetings trying to find solutions, and they’re glad of a break from conflict. There’s not many of them left, mind. Most of the dissenting voices were sacked in BJ’s temper tantrum last August.\nI’m writing this on Sunday morning. By the time it’s published, Cummings may have been axed. There’s normally no hesitation in throwing an advisor or two under the bus to save a PM or minister’s hide. So either DC has some serious dirt on BJ’s inner circle, or they’re terrified that one admission of failure will lead to a torrent.\nHere’s a challenge to any of our North East Conservative politicians. Show us you’re grown-ups. Tell the truth. Call out your cabinet ministers who lied and wriggled to defend Cummings. Ask for a public apology. Show us there’s an alternative to government by toddler.\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 25.5.20",

Last Christmas was just a vague memory. As you get older, your perception of time changes. And since we went into the first lockdown last March, time seems to be behaving very strangely indeed.\nNormally, we structure our perception of time around events. Birthday parties and anniversaries. Kids off school. Getting away on holiday. Without these landmarks, we feel in a perpetual no-man’s land. Like we’re stuck in that limbo time between Christmas and New Year, where you have no idea what day it is, but you know it’s fine to eat chocolates for breakfast.\nWith the days running into each other, and no highlights to look forward to, it’s tempting to watch one of those 24 hour news channels. Even while you’re doing it, you know it’s a mistake – there’s just so much doom and gloom. Since I became a politician I’ve stopped watching rolling news – it’s too superficial. I imagine it’s what it must feel like when a meteorologist is asked “will it rain next weekend?” and is expected to give a “yes or no” answer.\nTo get your attention, the media keep using the term ‘unprecedented’, particularly about Covid-19. I think we’ve worked out it’s unprecedented, we don’t need to be told. The global media have had a field day with all the unprecedented events caused by the unprecedented President. The holder of the highest office on the planet was – let’s tell the truth here – a pathological liar. Who advocated white supremacy, sexually assaulting women, and injecting bleach into your lungs as a Covid treatment. His administration withdrew from the Paris climate agreement and let Covid run rampant. Not to mention the corruption, inciting violence and the fantasist claim that he’d won a landslide in the election. All unprecedented, but it’s noticeable how quickly people just came to adapt to it.\nUnprecedented can describe good news, too. Kamala Harris becoming the United States’ first female Vice President, the highest-ranking female elected official in U.S. history, and the first African American and South Asian American Vice President. I caught Joe Biden’s inauguration speech. He’s not a young man, and Kamala Harris might be the first woman president of the US. For me, the highlight of that speech was undoubtedly Bernie Saunders’ unprecedented mittens, and all the memes they’ve spawned.\nIn times like this, it’s easy to lose perspective. Just as Trump’s abuse and lies were not robustly challenged by the US media, we’re seeing a numbing of UK news responses.\nLast week, hundreds of thousands of police records were accidentally wiped from the police database. Home Secretary Priti Patel ’s was asked whether any of the data had been permanently lost. I was staggered when she answered to the effect, “Dunno mate.” And the Prime Minister couldn’t tell the House of Commons how many cases are affected by the lost data. In any previous era this would be a government defining story. Now it’s submerged in mix of speculation, guesswork and urban legend that passes for Britain’s public debate. No wonder people doubt the accuracy of information coming from the Government.\nOne positive unprecedented event was the speed of the vaccine development. It is, of course, extraordinarily difficult to predict what will happen with the virus. And how quickly – or carefully – we can come out of lockdown.\nDespite the Government’s bizzare decision to cut the number of vaccines for the North East because we’re too successful at delivering it, the most vulnerable groups are being vaccinated. NHS staff and volunteers are working tirelessly. Take-up rates are positive too: in the North East and Yorkshire, 715,903 people have had their first dose, and 71,508 have had both doses.\nIt is the tiniest spark of light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. Let’s focus on that little spark and watch it grow.\nOriginally Published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 25.1.21",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_understanding-the-human-impact-of-price-rises/content_301.html": "Understanding the Human Impact of Price Rises\nJanuary 30, 2022\nWhen he was PM, David Cameron was famously asked if he knew the price of a supermarket loaf of bread. He didn’t have a clue, and waffled on about owning a bread-maker. Johnson didn’t fare much better when pressed by Jeremy Paxman on the cost of a pint of milk. Conservative MP Nadine Dorries described them as “Posh boys who don’t know the price of milk”.\nWe get ours from the milkman, 75p a pint. Call me retro, or just keen on supporting small businesses, but it comes in handy when your teenage sons have drunk the fridge dry. A quick press on an app, and more milk appears on the doorstep next morning.\nInflation running at 5.4% is a rough indicator of how hard prices will hit people’s wallets. But statistics can hide the real world impact. Anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe points out that last year the Smart Price pasta in her local Asda was 29p for 500g. Today, it is unavailable, so the cheapest bag is 70p. A whopping 141% inflation rate for people who are at the bottom end of the income ladder.\nReciting grocery prices is less important than understanding the human impact of price rises. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is worth around £200 million. He built a £400k leisure complex at his North Yorkshire mansion. It’s not even his main home – that’s his £7 million house in Kensington. And if he runs short, his father-in-law is worth £3.8 billion. In 2020, Mr. Sunak failed to declare £430 million of his wife’s shares on the register of ministers’ interest. It’s not relevant, he said. I’m guessing they don’t need to empty the loose change jar at the end of the month to put food on the table.\nHis insistence on raising National Insurance Contributions (NICs) penalises the very people who do all the work in our country. If you’re earning £30,000 a year from work, a full 9% of your salary will go in NICs. When the energy price cap is lifted in April, gas & electricity tariffs are forecast to rise by 50%. Typical energy bills will rocket £700, to £2,000 a year. If you’re on an average wage, this price hike will swallow up 10% of your income. For a care worker on minimum wage, fuel alone eats up two months’ take home pay. The effects will cascade through our economy. Less disposable income hits local shops and leisure business still struggling from Covid.\nIf you’re lucky enough and prudent enough to have built up some savings, they’re being eroded too. Inflation is running 4% higher than you’ll get on a cash ISA or savings account. This is a real worry for many, especially the elderly. Your money is evaporating.\nWe’re doing what we can in the North of Tyne. We’ve protected over 2,600 direct jobs through the pandemic, and are creating over 4400 new ones. Good jobs, with full time, secure contracts and decent wages, backed by our Good Work Pledge. Our Child Poverty Prevention programme is tackling poverty at the sharp end. Working with families discreetly, and with dignity, so kids don’t get labelled and bullied for receiving help. We’ve supported over 1,700 local firms. And we’ve brought big firms here, paying salaries in the £40,000s and £50,000s.\nBut we don’t have the levers the Chancellor has. Britain should have a wealth tax. There is no economic reason not to. There’s a raft of research on different proposals. The basic idea is you pay a very small percentage of your total assets above a threshold. One example is 1% of everything above £3.4 million. So if your house, savings, and that spare Picasso in the downstairs loo total up to £3 million, you don’t pay a penny. If you’re worth £4 million, you pay 1% of the amount above the threshold. 1% of £600,000 is £6,000. I reckon if you’re worth £4 million, you can afford £6,000 a year.\nA group of 102 millionaires and billionaires have started the “Tax us now” campaign, calling for a wealth tax. I confidently predict that Rishi Sunak will not be joining them. A wealth tax is one policy that he personally would “get”.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 31 Jan 2022",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_who-should-control-the-buses/content_141.html": "Who should control the buses?\nDecember 3, 2023\nI was invited to COP28 in Dubai this week. The gathering of international leaders, where commitments to reducing carbon emissions are made. In theory, these are the people who are going to save the world. In truth, they’re probably somewhere between the Avengers and Dad’s Army. Whilst it’s important that we don’t panic, we do urgently need to assemble our forces to save humanity.\nI declined the invitation. Flying 7000 miles and adding 2.26 tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere, to attend an event where I’d have limited influence is not a good use of taxpayer money. Some politicians are all about the photo op. I chose to stay in the North East and crack on with things I can influence. This week it’s buses, trains and green energy.\nLet’s start with the buses. Last Friday saw the end of the Go North East bus strike. The past few weeks have been tough – passengers inconvenienced and out of pocket. Many people had to use expensive taxis to get to work or appointments.\nThe bus workers had every right to push back against low pay. There is no way that workers in Sunderland, Gateshead and Percy Main are worth £5000 a year less than workers in Manchester and Warrington, doing the same job at the same company. Be honest, if you were in their position, wouldn’t you feel aggrieved?\nAs Mayor I could see the damage to both the striking workers and the bus passengers. That’s why I met with Unite the Union, and with Go North East’s management. I relayed messages between the two, we managed to get the bus company to return to the negotiating table. After that, they hammered out a deal and the buses are running again, with free travel for the rest of this week.\nFrom next May devolution will expand beyond the North of Tyne. With the new £6.1 billion North East devolution deal I’ll look to bring buses back under public control to avoid disruption like this in the future.\nIn the North East we spend £3 billion a year on 861,000 private cars. That’s £3,484 per car per year. But 41% of adults say a lack of efficient, reliable public transport stops them ditching their car. That’s 353,000 North East car owners who’d rather save the money, but can’t. Imagine what 353,000 fewer cars would do for traffic.\nI’m serious about building a Total Transport Network across the North East, under democratic public control. We can tackle the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis at the same time. That’s why last week I signed-off on £2.5 million for improvements to Central Station, as part of the new Northumberland Line connecting Ashington to Newcastle city centre. If Londoners deserve a first-class public transport system, so do we!\nI’ve also been cracking on with our green investment plans. Last week I was in London for the Global Investment Summit. I’ll admit that networking in gilded rooms full of oil paintings, Conservative Cabinet Ministers, billionaires and hedge fund managers is not my typical pastime. But it is my duty as Mayor to secure investment in our regional.\nThe North East has world-class universities producing impressive research. But when it comes to turning that research into money and employment, the benefits travel south. This fund, established by the North of Tyne, will fund start-ups and spin-outs to keep them and their well-paid jobs here. Many of these companies are in clean energy technology, decarbonisation, life sciences and digital technology. When they grow and generate profits, that money returns to us – with interest. The value generated gets recycled back into the North East instead of being siphoned off to tax havens in the Caribbean. Now that’s proper levelling up. And yet again, we’re the first Combined Authority in the country to do it.\nIn the North East we’re changing the story. By investing in green technology and a first-class public transport network, we can create good jobs, generate wealth and tackle the climate crisis. Instead of jumping on a jet to Dubai, maybe Mr Sunak should have hopped on a bus up north to see how we tackle the climate crisis here.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_a-meal-deal-not-for-the-masses/content_168.html": "A Meal Deal not for the Masses\nJuly 12, 2020\nA fortnight ago, Boris Johnson compared himself to US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. FDR’s New Deal turned round the economic collapse of the Great Depression. He created the first ever US state pensions and unemployment insurance. He promoted collective bargaining, improving wages and working conditions. The Public Works Administration built dams, bridges, schools and hospitals.\nLast Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak launched a flagship scheme to give us up to a tenner off a meal out. But only from Monday to Wednesday. Throughout August. Participating restaurants only. Terms and conditions apply.\nLess of a New Deal, more of a Meal Deal.\nA package of “up to” £30 billion should have given confidence. It hasn’t. In the past few days I’ve spoken to businesses, investment firms, journalists and economists. Underwhelmed doesn’t cover it.\nFirst and foremost, “economic activity” will only recover once people feel safe. We need a working test system.\nNew Zealand implemented strict lockdowns and a rapid test, trace and isolate system. Since May they’ve been bobbing along at between 0 and 2 new cases per day. Weeks ago, they removed restrictions and returned to normal. Total death count, 22.\nIn the UK we had herd immunity. Then no herd immunity. The PM’s senior advisor driving across the country while he knew he was infected. VE day street parties with conga lines. The official government decision to suspend the contact tracing system way back in March. Then a half-baked scheme for a national app. Then another U-turn. Then a world-class system in place at the start of June. That isn’t yet operational, despite it now being the middle of July. Total death count, 45,000.\nLook after your people, and the economy will look after itself. It’s the first duty of any government.\nNow, the OECD is warning that UK unemployment will hit 4 million this year. There was nothing in Wednesday’s announcement for High Streets. Yet last week we’ve seen Boots and John Lewis announce 5000 job losses. Nothing for manufacturing, despite 12,000 job cuts in aviation.\nNorth East councils face a £272 million black hole in their budgets. It’s the same across the country. In May, government said “do what you need to tackle the crisis. We’ll pay for any costs.” Government is now refusing to honour that promise. Unless they do, there’ll be emergency budgets, services cut, and thousands more job losses. Replacing permanent jobs with six-month Kickstart schemes is bad economics.\nWhat should the Chancellor have done?\nFirst, target spending into the productive economy. Wednesday’s announcement showed no awareness of what our regional economies need.\nWe submitted a plan for £100 million investment in the offshore and renewables industry. The Chancellor could have said, “We’ve left the EU. We’ll require that all offshore wind in UK waters must have 50% British content.”\nWe have a whole industry along the Tyne and in the North East that can supply it. The industry would scrabble to invest here. It would create thousands of high quality jobs. It would cement the North East as a world-leader in renewable energy. It would pave the way for a Just Transition from fossil fuels into clean energy. It would pay for itself.\nCutting Stamp Duty is a wasteful way of encouraging house building. Seven out of eight house buyers are moving in a chain. Only one in eight moves to a new build.\nThere are nine Metro Mayors. The Chancellor could have said, “Here’s £500 million each. Build 5000 affordable, eco-homes. You can sell them on, rent them as council houses, either way, it pays for itself.” It would tackle the housing crisis, homelessness, climate change and create skilled jobs.\nNewcastle has nearly 60,000 students. Overseas students, especially from the Far East, won’t be coming here until we get Covid-19 under control. The Chancellor could have said, “I’ll fund all university tuition fees for all UK students who start this September or next.”\nIt would fund our universities by getting them to do what they’re there for. And skill up our workforce with high quality education.\nWe needed a Green New Deal. Instead, we got a Meal Deal.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 13.7.21",

I dashed to Central Station, umbrella aloft, to welcome (current) Transport Minister Wendy Morton. She hadn’t brought an umbrella, and always one to put chivalry ahead of politics, I found myself huddling under my umbrella with a Tory Rail Minister at a time of national rail crisis. The things I do for this job. We walked through the rain bouncing off the pavement to the nearby Common Room, formerly the Mining Institute.\nGreat British Railways is looking for a home. GBR is the new body that will oversee train operators, infrastructure and stations. It’s not taking the rail network fully into public ownership, mind, which it should. Too much of Britain’s infrastructure is run for profit but owned by foreign governments. That’s part of the reason energy and transport are so much more expensive in the UK. But I digress.\nWe were there to persuade the minister to choose Newcastle for GBR’s home. Part of the process is a public vote – if you haven’t already, please vote online for Newcastle.\nTalented local poet Papi Jeovani set the scene. Members of the local investment team made the financial and logistical case. I made the strategic and historic case, avoiding puns about being “on the right track”.\nFlashback 18 years, I said, and I was on honeymoon. My wife and I walked around the agora in Athens. Pnyx hill, near the Acropolis, was the ancient meeting place of Athens’s citizens. The ‘bema’ – stone platform – is still there.\nI stood on it, in the footsteps of giants. I imagined Pericles giving the funeral speech for those lost in the Peloponnesian war. The Athenian citizens choosing to reject tyranny and embrace democracy. It gave me goosebumps. It’s like the history rises up from the ground and you feel it through your feet.\nThe site we’re offering for Great British Railways is the exact place Stephenson and his engineers built the Rocket and the Locomotive two centuries ago. Not across the city, or nearby; the exact place. Other cities may have connections, but, like the Pnyx and democracy, this is where it really started. And, like democracy, it changed the world. If you want to inspire the workers at GBR, this is its spiritual home.\nThe North of Tyne is by far the geographically largest Combined Authority. Yet we don’t have a single mile of three lane motorway. You can’t get from North to South or East to West by dual carriageway. If the Department of Transport had been in Newcastle, we’d miraculously have a great road network. It would just have been on their radar.\nThe Climate Emergency dictates thinking beyond mass road building. Bringing GBR to Newcastle will give the North East the attention we need to redress decades of underinvestment.\nWe have the Tyne & Wear Metro – Britain’s second biggest light rail system, with a new fleet of trains being built right now. Our office space is cheaper than other cities, and in the heart of a transport hub.\nThere’s the Hitachi rail factory just down the road. We’re leading Europe on battery technology to decarbonise transport. There are 3000 rail workers already in the region. Four excellent universities within a few miles, and a University Technical College right on the site. What better way to inspire those students than to be learning right next door to the home of GBR?\nOur commitment to zero-carbon transport is unwavering. I’ve spoken to dozens of Ministers and Secretaries of State to get transport powers devolved. Our plans for fully-integrated public transport are ambitious. I don’t own a car, and get around using public transport, walking and cycling. (I have a clean driving license, just in case you’re wondering!)\nAnd it’s Great British Railways – not Great English Railways. Choosing Newcastle shows Scotland that we want to keep our union. I don’t want passport controls at Berwick.\nBut ultimately, it’s a political decision, and a Conservative politician will make it. It’s a test of whether they’re serious about levelling up.\nThe public vote to back Newcastle is open until Monday 15th August – please vote and prompt your family and friends too.",

The risk is Labour sits back: “Never interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake.”\nWrong. If the labour movement abandons the field of ideas to the Tory competitors, we’re giving them a free run.\nYes, stay out of their squabbles. But this summer the people of Britain are facing a cost-of-living crisis.\nFamilies will struggle to pay for a holiday. Fuel prices are through the roof. Real wages are through the floor.\nWorking people are being forced into industrial struggle just to protect the pallid status quo the past decade of austerity has left us with. And large sections of our population are already disaffected. This summer, we could see discontent spiral into the blind alley of rioting.\nWhile the Tories up the ante on blaming the victims of austerity, Labour must look like a government in waiting. A real government that can offer real hope to the very real problems people see in their daily lives.\nOtherwise some will fall for the same old Tory trick: “We’ve changed! Take us back! We’ve got rid of that awful Mr Johnson. You can trust us with the economy. Sure, there’ll be some harsh medicine, but we’re all in it together.” Served up with a healthy dose of culture wars.\nThe antidote is a national programme that works for workers.\nEnding profiteering and stabilising energy prices by bringing utilities into public ownership.\nGiving all those key workers who kept our country running through the pandemic an immediate cost of living pay rise.\nOutlaw fire and rehire and other abusive employment practices. And let’s redefine “affordable” housing — 80 per cent of local market price is not affordable to young families starting out. There’s nothing wrong with the words “council” and “housing.”\nAnd challenge the racism head-on: relocating people to Rwanda or keeping them in detention camps is immoral.\nAnd we back it up by pointing to the evidence of what socialists in local, regional and Welsh governments have done.\nI’ve been mayor for three years. We set up a brand new combined authority from scratch. On my first day, we didn’t even have marker pens for the whiteboards.\nI declared a climate emergency. Our Green New Deal is now operational — to fund low-carbon manufacturing with local firms, restore peat bogs to increase biodiversity, and help public-sector buildings generate renewable energy.\nWe’ve invested in Battleship Wharf in Blyth and the Swan Hunter shipyard site for offshore wind — I’m looking forward to the day we see engineers back at work there.\nWe’ve boosted our offshore industry. We’ve created jobs in digital firms. In battery technology. In manufacturing modular buildings for high-tech facilities that don’t use fossil fuels. This is the green industrial revolution in action.\nWe’re working with the NHS to insource manufacturing jobs in their supply chain, reducing energy and reversing profiteering. Our culture and creative fund supports freelancers in arts and culture.\nKids are getting a hands-on climate education, measuring biodiversity at primary school, working on real engineering challenges at secondary, and sixth-formers working with computer game developers on climate change games.\nOur Spacehive crowdfunder directly empowers communities to choose their own projects. We’ve funded community gardens in Newcastle, beekeeping on the Meadow Well and beach wheelchairs at Cullercoats.\nWe’re building community-led housing and social housing on brownfield sites. And we have a clawback in place so developers who make large profits have to pay it back, so we can make more homes affordable. But we still need the law changing to make council housing viable again.\nThe Tories cut the Union Learn project. We’ve restored it and made it stronger — because unionised workplaces are more productive, safer, and have lower staff turnover. Labour politicians must never shy away from standing with our sisters and brothers in the trade unions.\nOur skills programme leaves no-one behind. Individual coaching and support for people with autism, or neurodiversity, and young people who’ve had a tough start in life, and adults with complex needs around mental illness and substance abuse.\nIn our first year, despite the pandemic, 28,800 people enrolled in adult skills courses, boosting their earning potential. The number of working-age adults without qualifications has fallen from 7.1 per cent to 6 per cent in just one year!\nWe’re tackling the real wrecking ball that crushes people’s futures: runaway finance capital. It’s a small start, but we’re working with co-ops and socially trading organisations like charities, with our £15 million Access to Finance fund — recycling money in our region. And there’s much more in the pipeline.\nGovernment set us a 30-year target of 10,000 jobs. By now, we should have a pipeline of 1,000 new jobs.\nThe reality is 4,586 new jobs and another 2,700 jobs saved by our investment through the pandemic. That’s 13 years progress in three years.\nCreating good jobs generates wealth. For every £1 I spend, the Treasury recoups over £3 in payroll taxes alone.\nThen there’s the economic benefits of having people earning a good living rather than living in poverty and insecurity. The notion that leaving industrial strategy to the free market is somehow good value for money is nonsense.\nOur Good Work Pledge underpins all these jobs. It guarantees mental health support at work. An end to all exploitative contract practices. Trade union recognition. In-work progression to turn a job into a career. And the Real Living Wage — £20 a week more than the minimum wage, and much more for under-25s.\nThat firms can pay someone less based on their age is a naked injustice. Employers covering 40,000 workers have now signed up to our Good Work Pledge.\nWhat’s the driving force for this success?\nCollaboration. Co-design. Working with the people on the front line, who do the work in our society.\nI work closely with our trade unions. And I stand with workers when they need solidarity.\nThe Durham Miners’ Gala — the Big Meeting — is about solidarity.\nThe banners. The traditions. The speeches. And I’m sure a few beers.\nIt’s about recharging the batteries of the labour movement for the next phase of the struggle to build a better world.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_get-on-top-of-the-virus/content_159.html": "Get on Top of the Virus\nAugust 17, 2020\nIt was announced last week that we’re officially in a recession. In other news, the Pope is a Catholic.\nMore than a million and a half people have signed-on in the past few months. Many more don’t claim. I spoke to one lad, perhaps in his late thirties. “I didn’t bother signing on,” he told me, “There’s no point. I’ve got savings.”\nHe’s done everything right – worked hard, been careful with his money, saved up. He’s a driver, taking what work he can, part-time, on reduced hours. His lifetime’s savings are evaporating.\nThe idea that we will see a V-shaped recovery is optimistic. That would mean recovering at the same rate as it took to crash. But why is a virus tanking the economy? Our annual winter flu crisis doesn’t.\nTo stop the virus, we have to change the way we work. Fewer people allowed in a building. Goods handled in a different way. Individual tasks taking longer. Whole employment sectors closed down. Because we don’t know who has the virus, and who doesn’t.\nA recovery depends on an effective track and trace system. Until we’re all confident we’re safe, we can’t end physical distancing.\nOn the 11th February, the SAGE meeting acknowledged that Public Health England did not have the track and trace capacity to cope with a pandemic. The existing system had worked for smaller outbreaks. There is a network of skilled professionals in every local area that do this work all the time. Call me obvious, but I would have funded extra capacity for those teams, already in place, on the ground.\nWhat did the government do? Delayed three months before launching a contract tracing system on 28th May. In the mean time, the UK suffered one of the highest death rates in the world.\nOn the 12th April, the Health Secretary announced the new NHS app for contact tracing. You could download an app on your phone that would detect other people’s phones using Bluetooth. If you developed symptoms, those you’d been near would be notified. On the 24th April, we were told it would be ready in weeks. On the 28th April it would be ready by the middle of May. On the 4th May the app was piloted on the Isle of Wight. It would go national at the end of May.\nUnfortunately, the app could only worked on 4% of Apple phones and 75% of Android phones. Undeterred, on the 18th May Downing Street announced that the NHS contact tracing app would be launched nationwide in the “coming weeks”.\nIn mid-June the inevitable U-turn came. After two wasted months, Government asked Apple and Google to take over the design of the Track and Trace app. This might be available by Christmas, but no promises. World beating? You decide.\nSo where are we now? If you test positive, you’re told over the phone to self-isolate. You’re asked who your contacts are. They are then told to isolate for 14 days.\nAccording to ministers, only around 76% who test positive are successfully contacted by the national tracing system. On average, people give 2.5 contacts. This is clearly under-reporting. They might not even know who they were near in a queue or a shop. Of those contacts given, only around 52% are successfully contacted.\nWe have no data on whether people follow the instructions. Or if those told to isolate develop symptoms.\n£10 billion has been allocated via private contracts to run test & trace nationally. It is clearly underperforming. Local public health teams are the experts. Government should fund local authorities to do the job properly.\nThere is growing evidence that people in the lowest-paid jobs are not cooperating. There are 5 million people working in the gig economy. The vast majority cannot work from home. If asked to self-isolate for 14 days, they can’t earn money to buy food or pay their bills. They might lose their jobs.\nGovernment must give all workers the ability to self-isolate without losing pay.\nThe only way to recover the economy is to get on top of this virus. Keeping people safe and protecting the economy are two sides of the same coin.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 17.8.20",

Lots of people did. Colin Firth won an Oscar.\nLast week we had the first King’s Speech since 1951. Or 2010 if we’re talking about the film, with Geoffrey Rush as Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue.\n“Why should I waste my time listening to you?” said Lionel Logue.\n“Because I have a right to be heard! I have a voice!” replied King George VI.\nWhile a therapist may have helped his grandfather to speak in public, King Charles III did well not to choke on the script handed to him by the Government.\n“A Bill will support the future licensing of new oil and gas fields, helping the country to transition to net zero by 2050,” he said, forced to parrot the Government line that burning more fossil fuels will lower carbon emissions.\nAs a lifelong environmentalist I’m sure the King doesn’t buy that argument at all.\nNor did my audience when I spoke at the Net Zero North East summit on Monday.\nAsked if they thought the policies announced by the Conservatives or Labour were sufficient to tackle the climate emergency not a single hand went up.\nThis wasn’t a room full of Extinction Rebellion or Just Stop Oil activists but hundreds of representatives from industry, commerce, universities, and public institutions.\nA desire to pass on a habitable world to our children and grandchildren is utterly mainstream. It’s only Westminster where anti-science arguments hold sway. And some dark corners of the internet.\nI was talking to Nelson, my then 14-year-old son, ahead of last year’s summit. He’d just come back from a banner drop to raise awareness of the climate emergency. He told me, “Logically, Dad,” he said, “we know we won’t keep global heating to 1.5 degrees. That’s gone. We’re on target for over 3 degrees. I know that’s the world I’ll have to live in. We won’t be worried about pensions. Or whether we can afford to buy a house. My generation will be worried about whether the shops have any food. Whether there’ll still be law and order.”\nThis year is already 1.43 degrees above pre-industrial average temperatures. The Earth is a complex system, and feedback loops are kicking in. Less ice means more heat is absorbed. Rainfall changes are causing forest die backs. Permafrost is melting in Siberia, releasing methane. The planet is match-funding human emissions. This October was 1.7 degrees hotter than the 1880’s baseline. The 2016 Paris Climate Accord has failed. It doesn’t sound much. But ecosystems are collapsing and crops failures are increasing.\nThere is no bigger challenge. But the Government fiddles while our planet burns. I don’t know if Mr Sunak plays the violin like the Roman Emperor Nero. But some of his MPs and Lords are on the fiddle. Or distracting the public with familiar culture war tunes.\n“You can’t call for an armistice on Armistice Day.”\n“Young people can’t afford to buy property because they’re wasting money on avocado toast.”\n“Rough sleeping is a ‘lifestyle’ choice.”\nThe self-styled Homelessness Secretary is right when she says, “Nobody in Britain should be living in a tent on our streets.” But wrong to describe this as a preference for life under canvas rather than bricks and mortar. The ongoing cost-of-living crisis is increasing the number of vulnerable people with nowhere else to go.\nThe weirdest one is complaining about 15-minute cities. Why are they unhappy with having a local shop or post office within fifteen minutes’ walk?\nEven the Prime Minister later conceded that people have the “right to peacefully protest.” Wiser heads have cautioned against politicians choosing who does and who does not have the right to demonstrate.\nWhen even the distractions last for less time that it takes to rip up the previous month’s policy you know we are on the road to nowhere. Where even the talking heads struggle to keep the party line.\n“You still stammered on the ‘W,’” said Lionel Logue. “Well, I had to throw in a few so they knew it was me,” King George VI replied.\nWhen it comes to net zero, Westminster is still stuttering. Whoever writes the King’s Speech.",

Arriving in the green room, stripping off layers of overcoat and fleeces, I offered my hand to fellow guest, ex-Conservative MP, Lord Timothy Kirkhope.\n“Should I call you Timothy or Tim?” I asked. There was a pause. “Or Lord Kirkhope?”\n“How about Tory scum?” he asked, without making eye contact.\nFew things in politics shock me, but that did. This was not a jocular ice breaker.\n“I don’t go in for that kind of language,” I said, “not my style at all.”\nIt’s true. I’m very much a ‘hate the sin, love the sinner’ kind of guy. It’s the Golden Rule: treat others as you would wish to be treated.\nBy the time we’d chatted and done the show, we’d found common ground that the Government should treat asylum seekers better. He offered me a lift, but I was going in a different direction. Literally as well as politically.\nI walked home across the Town Moor. Frost was glistening on the footpath. Frozen blades of grass stood sharp. It’s rare to have a clear, panoramic view in the middle of a city. Our horizons are usually cluttered with buildings and vehicles and noise. It literally gives you a different perspective.\nAstronauts experience the ‘overview effect’. Last year, William Shatner, Star Trek’s Captain James T. Kirk, became the oldest man to go to space. On his return he wrote, “While I was looking away from Earth, and turned towards the rest of the universe, what I understood, in the clearest possible way, was that we were living on a tiny oasis of life, surrounded by an immensity of death. I saw the deepest darkness I could have ever imagined, contrasting starkly with the welcoming warmth of our nurturing home planet.”\nStar Trek looks dated now, but was revolutionary in its day. Mr Chekov was a Russian serving on the USS Enterprise at the height of the Cold War. Lt Uhura was a black woman bridge officer. The first interracial kiss on US television. Star Trek’s Prime Directive is anti-colonial.\nThere’s a different vision of the future, too. Most pre-Star Trek sci-fi was dystopian. But Jean-Luc Picard explains, “The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.”\nThe recurring plot theme was seeking mutual understanding. Aliens have the same strengths and failings we have.\nAnd so it is in politics. To change someone’s mind requires understanding their point of view. Sometimes you can reach agreement. By working with government ministers, we’ve got £10’s of millions of extra investment in the past year.\nYet the philosophical differences in politics are real. Sometimes, as in Star Trek, diplomacy fails and we launch photon torpedoes at each other.\nI cannot accept any suggestion that children growing up in poverty is a tolerable or inevitable consequence of a modern economy. Those MPs who voted to deny children free holiday school meals are just morally wrong.\nI cannot accept that people fleeing persecution should be deported to Rwanda. Or that we should turn our backs on people’s sons and daughters drowning in the Channel.\nA lamb and a wolf are never going to agree on what to have for dinner. But if you go in “shields up”, with hostility, no one communicates.\nTrade unions are winning disputes using the power of rational argument. Forensic accounting, for example, proving that pay rises are affordable. Mick Lynch won the public over by defying the stereotype and sticking calmly to the facts.\nAnger can make you feel better, for a while. But anger is not a plan. That suits those who benefit from the status quo.\nI want change. I want a world without obscene wealth inequality. Where we invest for a sustainable future for our children and grandchildren. I’d like a politics where evidence trumps abuse – we have work to do.\nAs William Shatner said, “I had to get to space to understand that Earth is, and will remain, our only home. And that we have been ravaging it, relentlessly, making it uninhabitable.”\nIn the end, we all want to live long and prosper.",

To a Zoom screen of blank faces. A pithy phrase loses its pith when you have to explain it.\nA friend told me that they’d been to this excellent restaurant in Wall, near Hexham. They pronounced it “Huh-gem”. Erm…Hjem, maybe?\nIf I said “Ahm gan hyem” how many people, apart from Geordies, would understand me? Hjem, hyem – one word’s Danish and one’s Geordie, but they both mean the same thing – home. And home is not just a word or a place, it’s a powerful emotion. Ask Lindisfarne.\nIs cultural identity the reason Scotland and Wales have significant control over their own affairs, yet the English regions have so little? English regions don’t share the same sense of identity with each other as different parts of Scotland do. Scotland was an independent nation until the Act of Union in 1707.\nYou have to go back a long way to find the independent Kingdom of Northumbria. Or even Deira or Bernicia. That history is not taught in schools. Maybe I should commission a director to film an army of proud Geordies, faces painted black and white, all defiantly mooning a southern army who are shooting volleys of arrows at us? The Scottish Independence movement certainly got a boost from Braveheart. Ironic, since Mel Gibson is Australian-American.\nWelsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford said this week that Labour should prioritise local identities in its approach rather than pursuing a “pan-British sense of Labour”. Welsh Labour had “maybe noticed a bit earlier than some other places the strengthening and importance of identity in people’s sense of political affiliation.”\nLabour needs, he said, “a manifesto that speaks to the bread-and-butter stuff that people see in their everyday lives.” Spot on. I’ve been saying that in every interview and article on the subject since we emerged from lockdown. Wherever you are in Britain, or the world, we’re all united by wanting the security of a home and a decent income.\nDevolution is about shaping our future. Our heavy industry powered the industrial revolution. North East livelihoods depended on what we took out of the ground, and what we fashioned it into. Now we rely on what comes out of our minds, not our mines. We’re becoming a leading research centre, digital hub and pioneer in green technology.\nThere’s the feeling, too, that people are friendlier in the North. My niece, from Oxfordshire, was visiting our region checking out universities. Slightly lost, she was taken aback when ‘some old guy’ in the street (she’s a teenager, so anyone over 35 has one foot in the grave…) asked her, “you alreet, pet?” She was astounded that someone in the street would volunteer help. Mind you, this isn’t universal. A colleague at work, who is disabled, has been on the receiving end of some ugly abuse, and feels that Northerners are ‘more forthcoming’ rather than more friendly. That’s not something to be proud of.\nWe should be proud of our region, and our sense of place. We live in an area with an amazing array of towns, cities and landscapes. From urban estates, to the rural fastnesses of Northumberland, to the wild and beautiful coastline.\nAnd pride, as in house proud, impels us to make our homeland better. What sort of a region do we want to leave for our kids, for those coming after us?\nWe do want to be known as ‘friendly Geordies’. So let’s be friendly. We should ask people who are lost whether they’re okay, and not leave them wandering about. We should chat to strangers on buses and on the Metro. (Ever tried doing that on the Tube? I wouldn’t advise it). We should help people who look like they need it. Lord knows, there are enough poor souls around at the moment who could do with a helping hand.\nWe want people to enjoy being in our region, and to be both welcoming and welcomed. We want everyone who’s born here, who lives here, or who just visits, to think of the North East as hyem.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 20 June 22",

It would be a memorable way to call a General Election. But he didn’t. It was Oliver Cromwell, 371 years ago when he dissolved the Rump Parliament at the end of the English Civil War.\nThe deadline for a General Election on 2nd May this year has now passed.\nThe media focus will shift to local elections, and, because of the way the media works, the Mayoral elections. Will the Tories hold on in West Midlands and Tees Valley? Will the people of the North East reject the Westminster parties and elect Jamie Driscoll?\nOnly 12% of people trust political parties. That’s according to polling by the Office of National Statistics from September and October last year. Before Gaza. Before Labour dropped its £28 billion green investment pledge.\nNew polling from the Centre for Cities found that 51% of voters will choose their mayor based on the individual candidate, not their party.\nThe reality is that either I’ll win, or the Labour candidate will win. There is no second preference. Yet members are flooding out of the Labour Party. Meanwhile, thousands of people have donated to my campaign. An army of people are pushing my leaflets through letterboxes from Berwick to Barnard Castle.\nThis is not about Westminster, it’s about the North East. You can vote for me as Mayor and vote on party lines in the General Election. If you want the Tories out of Westminster, you can still vote Jamie for Mayor. People from all parties have told me they’re voting tactically for me.\nDuring this campaign you’ll hear some heartfelt words from other candidates about equality. About the environment. About how the North East is left behind. How our local businesses need more support. How our public transport system barely functions in rural areas. I agree with all of that.\nBut warm words don’t fix things. Neither do vague statements like, “I will look at…” or “we need to convene people…” We’re less than 5 weeks from the election. If you can’t say exactly how you’ll fix a problem, you’re not ready for the job.\nAnd if you believe everything politicians say during an election campaign, then I’ve got some magic beans I could sell you.\nPeople want competence from their politicians. They need competence from their politicians, after seeing Boris Johnson and Liz Truss as Prime Minister.\nYou want honesty, of course, and integrity too. I’ve claimed £0 in expenses since I was elected. I turn down every offer of corporate hospitality. If I go to the football or the theatre, I pay for my own ticket.\nAs for honesty, I have a 5-year track record you can interrogate. And it stacks up.\nAs North of Tyne Mayor I have one main target set by Government – create 1,667 new jobs in five years. What have I achieved? 5,377 full time, permanent jobs. That’s 320% of target.\nJobs in digital security. In renewable energy. In advanced manufacturing. In culture and creating industries. Good, well-paid jobs, in small local firms, in growing local businesses, and in big firms I’ve persuaded to set up UK headquarters here, instead of London.\nGet everyone a decent, well-paid job, and half our other social problems will disappear overnight. If people have money in their pockets, health will improve, and crime will fall.\nIn my 2019 manifesto, I said I would unite the region so we could get devolved transport powers and funding. I’ve kept that promise – and it took a lot of work. Many people in our region didn’t want to unite into a Mayoral combined Authority. Central Government didn’t want to give us anywhere near the money we now have. It is the best funded devolution deal in the country – £6.1 billion in total.\nI’ll use it to create a Total Transport Network. Fully accessible publicly controlled buses. Extended Metro lines. Integrated ticketing. Safer walking and cycling routes, especially around schools. Capped fares and free travel for 18s and under and students.\nJust ask yourself, if you were on the interview panel employing the CEO for the region, would you choose someone with 5 years’ experience of doing the job, with a track record of value for money, of bringing in investment, and of working cross-party to get things done? Or take a punt on someone who hasn’t?\nRe-elect me, this time as North East Mayor, and I’ll deliver again.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_valuing-the-arts/content_284.html": "Valuing the Arts\nSeptember 19, 2021\nSetting aside the Damien Hirsts of this world, most artists don’t take up their craft with the expectation of a private jet and a villa in Tuscany. They do it to satisfy an artistic drive – it’s part of who they are.\n‘Every child is an artist. The problem is staying an artist when you grow up’. That’s Pablo Picasso. The artists at the Lime Street Studios in the Ouseburn Valley would agree with him.\nThey agree, too, that the arts and the economy are inextricably linked.\nThe Government seems to think the arts has little importance. Why else would they be drastically cutting arts education in schools, colleges and universities? It’s a false economy. The arts not only enrich our lives, it employs over 137,000 people.\nI visited the artists at the Lime Street Studios recently. It’s sandwiched between The Cluny and Seven Stories on the Ouseburn Valley. I asked them what they needed to keep their artistic businesses vibrant.\nThey all have a ‘portfolio’ of ways to make a living. Selling artworks, taking commissions. A bit of teaching. Community art projects, music gigs and music therapy sessions. Putting on exhibitions. And art therapy work in hospitals, particularly for those with mental health problems.\nCovid, of course, completely pulled the rug out from under all of this. The artists have shown their resilience, and adapted. But many of the areas and people that needed the arts most have been hardest hit.\nWe talked about the value of art in education. How it produces more rounded individuals who have insights into other aspects of life that you don’t always get if you only study science or maths. That’s what the arts give you – it’s not only about becoming an artist or a musician – it’s about having a wider personal scope.\nThe future is going to be all about adaptability. My kids are good at science and maths – but unlike me, they’re also good at music and fine art. It will serve them well in a changing world.\nI asked what their economic barriers were. They told me there was a need for more buildings like the Studios. The need for accessibility and affordable rents. How artists need the confidence that they can build up their businesses and community networks without the worry of being moved on. And how these spaces are needed across the region, not just in Newcastle.\nThey need broadband in the whole building, so they can continue the online work they’ve been able to offer during lockdown. Which brings us back to diversity again. People with disabilities and mental health issues have had unprecedented access to the arts online. The Studio artists were very keen to make sure that wasn’t withdrawn.\nThey stressed the importance of having a space like the Lime Street Studios, but they need investment. Although they each run their own businesses, the Studio premises is run as a cooperative. All of the artists in the old bonded warehouse are part of its collective management, and make their own decisions about how to manage the space. But co-operatives find it difficult to attract investment.\nThat’s where the Combined Authority comes in.\nOur Cultural and Creative Investment programme provides steppingstones to support organisations to emerge from COVID on a more resilient, and sustainable, footing. Every business’s finance needs are different. That why our £2.625 million fund has numerous finance options. Small grants up to £5,000 each. Loans of around £50,000k to £150,000 at interest rates from 0% to 10%. And equity investment of up to £75,000.\nThere’s a separate offer for freelancers to help develop commercial skills such as protecting their intellectual property or developing their brand. We’re working in partnership with Creative England on the fund – have a look at what we’re offering at www.creativeengland.co.uk/northoftyne\nThe Studio artists told me how important it was to be able to access funding like this, without the strings or reams of paperwork.\nEconomic development has to be low-carbon and inclusive, so everyone benefits from it. It also has to be enriching. We need a culture of valuing the arts for their own sake.\nAnd the Combined Authority’s here to help with that.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 20 Sept 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_cutting-safety-is-false-economy/content_346.html": "Cutting Safety is False Economy\nMay 22, 2022\nTwenty years ago this month was the Potters Bar rail crash. On the 10th May 2002, a train from King’s Cross to King’s Lynn derailed at 97mph. The last carriage flipped, hit a bridge, and wedged between the platform and station buildings. Seven people were killed. 76 people were injured.\nThe subsequent inquiry found a set of points had separated when the train passed over them. The bolts had come loose. Yet the records showed the points had been fully inspected just nine days earlier by Jarvis PLC, the private railway maintenance contractor. Jarvis claimed the points must have been sabotaged.\nThe investigators found no evidence of sabotage. They did find the other points in the area had similar maintenance deficiencies, which “arose from a failure to fully understand the design and safety requirements.” In short, private maintenance firms were paying too little attention to training and safety. Jarvis concocted a cock-and-bull story to cover their backs. They were eventually prosecuted in 2010.\nTwo years before Potters Bar was the Hatfield rail crash. One of the rails had metal fatigue – a series of small cracks that weaken the metal. On the fateful day of 17th October 2000, the rail finally fractured. A GNER train travelling from King’s Cross to Leeds derailed at 115mph. The restaurant car separated from the rest of the train and collided with a gantry. Four people were killed, more than 70 were injured.\nPrivate contractors Balfour Beatty were responsible for maintaining the track. On 13th Nov 1999 – 11 months before the crash – Railtrack’s Head of Track wrote to the Head of Safety and Risk Management:\n“The balance between commercial drivers and safety are currently overwhelmingly towards the commercial. The culture in the Company is currently such that Zone Track Engineers are in fear of losing their jobs if they do not accept non-compliance.”\nFour days before the crash he wrote, “the significant increase in broken rail numbers and growth in traffic is increasing the risk of derailment”\nPeople knew this would happen. Senior management were warned this would happen, but they quite literally put profit before safety. In both cases, the private contractors eventually admitted their guilt, and paid £millions in fines and out-of-court settlements.\nIn Chuck Palahniuk’s novel Fight Club (and the film) the narrator describes “the Formula”.\n“A new car built by my company leaves somewhere travelling at 60mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A. Multiply it by the probably rate of failure, B. The multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A time B times C = X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don’t do one.”\nFree market capitalism at its purest.\nIn October 2002 Network Rail took over safety responsibility for rail infrastructure – track, points, signalling. For over a decade, Britain’s railways had the best safety record in Europe. But from 2019, government demanded that £3.5 billion be cut over the next five years.\nNetwork Rail plans to cut the wage bill by £100 million a year. That’s 2,660 rail maintenance jobs. Analysis from the RMT union shows that equals 670,000 fewer maintenance hours – a 34% reduction. Analysis by the TUC shows that bringing all the outsourced services back in house would save £115 million a year. But for some reason, this option is not being taken.\nThe RMT are currently balloting their 40,000 rail members on taking industrial action. This covers Network Rail and 15 train operating companies. The other rail unions, ASLEF, TSSA, and Unite, are also in dispute. They are all campaigning to defend rail jobs, pay and conditions. And to keep rail safe and reliable.\nLethal crashes make the headlines. But we typically experience poor rail maintenance as delays and cancellations. Twice last week I had to go to Leeds. In two return trips I experienced two trains cancelled, and two delayed because of signalling faults. Cutting safety is a false economy. The true cost of all those delays to passengers and freight will be huge. We can’t run Britain as a pound-shop country.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 23 May 22",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_we-must-break-the-production-line-metaphor-of-education/content_315.html": "We Must Break the Production Line Metaphor of Education\nAugust 28, 2022\nThursday was a big day in the Driscoll household: my sons got their GCSE results. I’ll not embarrass them by stating their results, but my 16 year old is off to sixth form to do his A-levels. My fourteen-year-old worked out that if he blitzed a few subjects early, he’d have more free time for other things. I think that warrants a merit in initiative.\nAlong with thousands of other parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles across the country I was proud of what my kids achieved. And grateful for everyone who helped: it takes a village to raise a child.\nThe essence of childhood should be joy. Education should be about discovery. But for many kids, probably most, exams are a source of stress. Those who’ve not the grades they hoped for will be coping with disappointment. Or worse still, not coping.\nWhat would an anthropologist from another planet make of our education system? Twelve years at school gets boiled down into a set of numbers from 9 to 1. Or A* to E, in old money. Grades get analysed. Published in league tables. Statistical comparisons made in press articles.\n“Why do you have this obsession with individually ranking children?” our alien would ask. “Why don’t you measure whether the kids are healthy? Or happy?” Even if you believe the sole objective of public education is to prepare kids to be efficient work units, you should measure the really important things, like whether they can collaborate and work well in a team. Or be self-directed.\nAnd most bizarrely, in all the discussion about education, no one talks to the children. Childhood is not a preparation for life. It is life. Sacrificing the joy of childhood for some promised economic future is self-defeating.\nWhen I was at school, we were told a story that if you worked hard and did well at school, you’d get a job, and a house, and be better off than your parents. If you had a degree, you’d have a good career. Kids today don’t believe you. And they’re not wrong. You’re better off with a degree, but it’s no guarantee of a job. Or that you’ll be able to pay your rent, your energy bills and save up to buy a home. You could be paying-back your education until well after you’ve got kids of your own.\nPublic education is a political football. League tables. Changing the curriculum. “Back to basics.” “In my day, we learned the 3 Rs.” Or as Michael Gove insisted, we can’t have kids learning foreign authors like John Steinbeck. Yet oddly, Greek and Roman classics were okay. I like both.\nWhat never gets examined is the actual basics of education. That’s the relationship between the teacher and the learner. Teaching is not a delivery system. There never will be some perfect formula of “knowledge” to be downloaded into young minds.\nChildren have a vast appetite for learning. We don’t need to teach kids to speak. Or to use mobile phones. Children, like adults, learn more from observation and imitating others than from following instructions. And the most important skill anyone can master is how to form productive relationships with other people. That hasn’t changed since we were hunter gatherers, and it won’t change in future.\nEvery child has feelings, motivations, interests, aspirations, passions, ambitions. The proper role for politicians in education is not to dictate, or legislate, or direct. It is to empower education professionals to have better teaching and learning relationships with their students.\nTo get this shift in education, and the willingness to fund it properly, requires winning the argument and telling the Little Englanders a harsh truth. The world they pine for has gone. And it’s not coming back.\nIf they’re lucky, a child leaving school today will retire in 2074. How do we educate our children to take their place in that future, given we don’t know what will happen with our economy next year?\nWe must break the production line metaphor of education. Our kids will need independence, self-awareness and interpersonal skills to solve the problems we’ve left them. And the best way to foster that, is to keep the joy in learning.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_dear-prime-minister/content_340.html": "Dear Prime Minister…\nOctober 30, 2022\nDear Prime Minister,\nI hope this letter finds you well and still at this address. Congratulations on your appointment – second time lucky, eh?\nToday was due to be the fiscal statement. You’ll forgive me for saying I don’t envy the challenge you’ve inherited from Ms Truss, Mr Johnson, Ms May and Mr Cameron. When you said, “mistakes were made,” the whole country nodded in agreement.\nYou announced how our country faces a profound economic crisis. Seeing as you held the purse strings and lived next door for most of the past few years, you’ll be fully aware of the challenges you’ve inherited from yourself.\nYou warned of the “difficult decisions to come”. I fear you missed a beat here. Millions of citizens face difficult decisions right now. Between heating and eating. Between paying their bills and buying their children winter clothes. With this misstep in mind, I hope you’ll allow me – as someone who was directly elected to my post – to offer some advice.\nWe do indeed face an extraordinary financial challenge. We all saw the graphs with plunging lines after Dr Kwarteng’s ‘mini-budget’. But don’t use the North to plug Westminster’s gap in public finances. You promised to bring “unity” to the UK. A noble aim. If we’re to navigate our way through the treacherous waters ahead, we must do so together. On a level.\nThat means following through on the levelling up commitments of your predecessors. Before you entered No. 10, I’d been working for three years with Ministers and Local Authority leaders – north and south of the Tyne – to get a North East Devolution Deal that works for our region. It would deliver billions to invest in jobs, homes, skills training, and much more. It would deliver greater control over things that matter to people – such as transport. It puts tackling inequality at its centre. It would empower us to take stronger action against the climate crisis. We just need your Government to let us sign on the dotted line. Please don’t let this be another Westminster casualty of chaos.\nWarnings about “a return to austerity” are concerning. Partly, because I’m not sure how we can return to something we never left. The gaping holes in local authority budgets have never been closed. Teachers, nurses, firefighters, police, rail workers, posties, university staff, ambulance drivers, physios, council workers – pretty much every keyworker has seen their pay fall far behind inflation. There’s a recruitment crisis. Every public service is creaking.\nAusterity doesn’t even work. It didn’t fix the public finances under Cameron; it won’t under you. You cannot cut your way to growth. What does work – and I speak from experience – is investing now to save later. We’ve proved that at the North of Tyne. We’re creating over 4,600 high-quality jobs. We’ve invested millions into our region and communities and trained nearly 30,000 people so they earn more and power our economy. And it pays for itself with long-term prosperity. Every £1 I invest returns over £3 to your Treasury in payroll taxes alone.\nNice one on re-instating the fracking ban, though – well done. The climate emergency is upon us. This summer it was 40C in a country otherwise infamous for being cold and wet. Floods displaced 33 million people in Pakistan. Forests are burning and crops are failing. Demoting Alok Sharma and not going to COP27 does not send a good message.\nI urge you not to miss the opportunity to make Britain a clean energy superpower. Here in the North East, we’ve made huge investments in offshore wind and electric car battery plants. Our Tyne Taskforce is supporting industry. We’re skilling thousands of people for green jobs. We’re teaching climate education in schools. We’ve got a plan ready to insulate homes and keep down energy bills. Back us – with your support we can lead the world.\nAnd support our Northern transport network. Londoners receive nearly three times more investment per head than we do. You have the power to reverse that – let’s invest in the transport we need to power up the North.\nYour Government’s 2019 mandate was built on a promise to level up Britain. Don’t abandon us: the North remembers.\nYours,\nJamie",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_twenty-twenty-vision/content_143.html": "Twenty-Twenty Vision\nJanuary 12, 2020\nTwenty twenty has a ring to it.\nLast year was politically turbulent. In the North of Tyne, though, we just got on with delivering prosperity for our people.\nI’ve been Mayor for eight months. Much of 2019 involved setting up a brand new combined authority. Recruiting staff, building relationships, and getting our first programmes underway.\nCentral government set the Combined Authority a target of creating 10,000 jobs over thirty years. That’s 1,667 jobs during my five year term.\nOur business expansion programme will create 200 jobs in rural Northumberland, 252 across Newcastle and North Tyneside, and another 70 at Newcastle Helix.\nOur Inward Investment Programme planned to bring another 600 jobs here. I’ve met directors of companies, talked up our area, and promoted our region. It’s working so well, we’ve expanded the programme to create 2000 jobs. Good jobs – permanent, well paid, with career prospects.\nThe five-year aim was 1,667 jobs. We’re on target for 2,522 in under a year.\nWe’ve set up a Returnships programme, supporting people who’ve been out of employment caring for loved ones. It boosts their confidence and skills to get back in to employment. Our Working Homes Programme helps people in social housing who’ve had difficulty getting in to work. It’s a supportive programme – not a coercive, benefit-sanctions approach.\nOur United Nations Accredited Climate Change Teacher programme is rolling out. We’ve implemented STEM programmes to promote science through stargazing, with the mobile observatory. The kids love it! Our industrial history project with the Woodhorn museum has been a hit. Our high-speed broadband programme will reach every public building in Northumberland. We’ve partnered with the Newcastle United Foundation, to rebuild Murray House and do youth work across the whole of our region. Giving kids a good start in life is a sound investment.\nAnd it’s important to lead by example. The Combined Authority has a gender pay gap of zero. The women get paid as much as the men.\nWe’ve more than tripled our budget by leveraging in money from private investment and other sources.\nWe’ve built a great team. I might be the centre-forward, putting the ball in the net, but behind me is a team of hard-working officers, and my cabinet colleagues.\nThere are too many good staff to list. Pat Ritchie, my Interim Chief Exec, deserves a special thank-you, for getting us up and running. Pat’s moving on to a new role. North Tyneside’s Paul Hansen is replacing her. With the support of my two new directors, Henry Kippin and Ruth Redfern, 2020 will see us breaking new ground.\nWhat’s in the pipeline for this year?\nSimple. Deliver the manifesto you elected me on.\nThe Good Work Pledge is a cornerstone of our work. It rewards good employers. Those who pay real living wages, promote career progression, and who look after their staff. Whether large or small, good employers will get an advantage when tendering for public sector work. This will raise the standard of employment across our region.\nOur Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Change will run this year. You, the public, will get a direct voice in making the tough choices we face to protect our future.\nWe’ll be setting up our first Community Hubs. There’s strength in our communities. With some funding and a bit of specialist support, we can enable people to take back control over their lives. Community hubs will be led by local communities.\nOn transport, we’ll see trials of the technology needed for joint ticketing. This is so you can swipe in and swipe out on any public transport, so it will automatically get you the best fare, even across different bus companies.\nFrom 1st August, we’ll be running Adult Education programmes. We’re awarding over £6mn of contracts to local providers to support our communities with skills and life opportunities they need. Education is the route not only to better jobs, but also richer lives.\nAnd starting this spring, I’ll be holding regular Mayor’s Question Times around the region, so I can talk to more of you in person.\nSo that’s my twenty-twenty vision. Happy New Year!\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 6th January 2020.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-people-just-want-someone-to-fix-it/content_28.html": "The people just want someone to fix it\nApril 7, 2024\nI was in Barnard Castle yesterday, talking to people in the Market Place. The owners of a catering business. A teacher. A retired surveyor. An engineer in renewable energy. Dozens more. They had one thing in common: no one trusts political parties.\nSome had been Conservative voters. Some Labour. For one woman “climate change is my number one concern”. The cost of living was high on everyone’s list. Every one of them was persuaded to vote for me. Which I was chuffed about, because I was also trying to eat a tray of loaded hash browns. Campaigning means food on the go.\nThe ex-Tories liked the pragmatism. The fact I get things done. Everyone likes the fact I haven’t charged a penny in council tax, and claimed £0 in expenses.\n“It’s a time for independents, especially for Mayor,” said one woman, a lifelong Labour voter, “But I’ll vote independent in the General Election if there is one.” Her husband, a trade union member, nodded in agreement.\nNext up was the Railway Institute in Shildon. Most politicians do a “launch” with handpicked guests and a glossy backdrop. I put a social media advert out, and anyone of any politics can come and ask me any question.\nI ask them questions, too. “When was the last time a politician in power came to speak to you?” I asked. “Never,” they answered.\nWe spoke about their food bank, and food poverty. The worries of the Hitachi workers – Shildon has never recovered from the loss of the wagon works forty years ago. Crime. Buses. Lots on buses. Domestic abuse. Local newspapers. Poor housing. Crime again, especially drugs. And underlying it all, the fear that yet again Shildon would be left behind.\n“We have no secondary school here,” said one woman, to much nodding and agreement. “What are you going to do about that?”\n“I’m not going to make false promises,” I said, “I can’t set up a school. What I can do is get a bus system that’s fast and reliable, and under public control. And I’ll make transport free for under 19s and students. Would that help?”\nWhat struck me is that everything they wanted was reasonable. They didn’t want a premier league football club or an international airport. They just wanted secure jobs that paid a decent wage, and the means to get them. That’s the core of my political philosophy – Britain should be run in the interests of the people who do the work.\nSomeone approached me afterwards. “I found that quite moving,” he said. “No one comes to places like this and listens. You didn’t just listen, you gave them answers in detail. You didn’t patronise them, either. You trusted them to understand what you were saying. And you were honest about what you could and couldn’t do.”\nPart of the reason the people don’t trust political parties is because political parties don’t trust the people. We get spoon fed sounds bites and platitudes.\nPart of the lack of trust is weasel words. “I will look to…” is a classic. “I would like it if…”. Or the go to, “I will launch a consultation on fixing this very serious problem.” The Mayoral election is less than a month away. If you haven’t got a plan, or can’t show where the money is coming from, you’re not ready to take office. We can’t have a Mayor who spends their first year running consultations.\nBut mostly it’s a complete refusal to take responsibility. I’m standing on my record. I’ve done the job for five years. I can point to thousands of people picking up a pay packet this month as a result of my successful policies. The tens of thousands of people who are matter trained, and earning more money. The people who’d lost confidence and are now earning good money. I’ve met hundreds of them, it has changed lives. I’ve seen the homes built. The schools where we’re helping tackle child poverty. The new railway line opening from Ashington to Newcastle.\nYet all we get from most politicians is, “it’s someone else’s fault.” The people have had enough. They just want someone to fix it.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_manifesto_total-transport-network_take-buses-under-public-control/content_88.html": "Take buses under public control\nWe finally have the powers to franchise the buses. It’s a legal process that takes some years, and I’ll weigh the evidence as part of the process. In effect it means the Mayoral Transport Authority will specify timetables, routes and fares. But it does mean paying a bus company to run the bus, so we must increase passenger numbers.\nBus improvements on the road, including smart traffic signals that prioritise buses, and smart phone ticketing will speed journeys up, so buses are almost as quick as cars – and without the need to park.\nPrivate bus companies like to cherry pick the most profitable routes and times. Bringing all the buses into one system means we can cross-subsidise routes, giving them time to build up their passenger numbers. As more destinations are part of the network, passenger numbers increase further, making previously uneconomic routes viable. This can only be done by bringing the buses into public control.\nIn time I would like to create a community and worker owned bus company, so we don’t face privatisation by a future Tory government that could deregulate buses and undo all our good work.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_democratic-accountability-is-now-optional-in-our-political-system/content_117.html": "Democratic accountability is now optional in our political system\nNovember 19, 2023\nThis week saw an unelected Prime Minister pick up the phone to a resigned former Prime Minister.\nTheir conversation may have gone something like this:\nMr Sunak. “Hi Dave. You up to much at the moment?”\nMr Cameron. “Oh, not too much since Greensill Capital went belly up and I lost my £1 million salary. Shame you couldn’t sort those extra Covid loans out for me. The £400 million from the British Business Bank wasn’t enough in the end.”\nMr Sunak. “Fancy coming back into Government?”\nMr Cameron. “Not sure. It didn’t go so well last time around. I never really enjoyed getting grilled in the House of Commons.”\nMr Sunak. “Oh, don’t worry about that. I’ll stick you in the Lords, you won’t even have to see those nasty opposition MPs asking you difficult questions.”\nMr Cameron. “But what about basic democratic accountability? I haven’t been elected by the public.”\nMr Sunak. “Don’t worry, neither have I!”\nOf course, none of us was in the room when Mr Sunak made the now Lord Cameron Foreign Secretary. But the signal is pretty clear – democratic accountability is now optional in our political system. The world is in intense geopolitical turmoil, while we have an unelected Foreign Secretary, unaccountable to the elected House of Commons.\nThe return of Mr Lord David Cameron to frontline politics feels like the plot-twist nobody wanted in the ongoing Tory psychodrama. The last 13 years has been plagued by Conservative Party manoeuvring and infighting, while fixing Britain’s problems has dropped off the end of their to-do list.\nBoris Johnson’s flagship ‘levelling up’ policy is a distant memory to voters in Blyth or Bishop Auckland. And as for ‘taking back control’ – we haven’t seen the £350 million a week for the NHS that was on the side of a bus. These days, you’re lucky to even see the side of a bus. We did see £335 million go to Greensill, though, before it collapsed, taking our taxpayers’ money with it.\nJust 11% of the British public would trust Mr Sunak to keep his promises. Only 21% trust Sir Keir. And that was before the Gaza ceasefire row. The 4th of his ten pledges was “No more illegal wars… put human rights at the heart of foreign policy.”\nThere is a democratic deficit in this country. The British public decisively voted-in only two of the last five Prime Ministers. Mr Sunak has a personal mandate of 193. No, I’ve not missed off some zeros. That’s the total number of people who actively chose our current PM. You couldn’t win a local council seat with 193 votes!\nI spoke at the Break up of Britain conference in Edinburgh on Saturday. Packed with people who want to improve our democracy. Britain is one of the most centralised countries in the developed world. Far too many decisions are made behind closed doors.\nWe used to control our own energy system. Our own water system. Now they are run for private profit. I’d be happy with public profits being reinvested to provide a better service. But they are cash cows to funnel £billions through overseas tax havens into the bank accounts of billionaires.\nOur transport system is chaotic and our buses are unregulated. The Go North East strike is dragging on. People can’t get to work or education precisely because all governments since 1986 have allowed buses to be run for short-term profit when they are clearly critical services that underpin our economy. I met with Unite the Union, and with Nigel Featham, managing director of Go North East, last week.\nI successfully persuaded him return to the table and negotiate with union representatives last Monday and Tuesday. But with no democratic regulation over bus services, management were able to refuse to budge, so talks broke down.\nTransport is the reason I pushed so hard to extend the North East Devolution Deal. From May next year, we’ll get powers to control our bus system. I intend to build a fully integrated Total Transport Network from Berwick to Barnard Castle, where one ticket will take you on bus, rail and Metro, with free travel for under-18s. That’s what taking back control looks like.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_like-our-spectacular-bridges-devolution-should-bring-us-together/content_63.html": "Like our spectacular bridges, devolution should bring us together\nFebruary 11, 2024\nCrossing the Tyne is one of the most stunning views from a train in this country. The view over Durham Castle and Cathedral, in the loop of the Wear, is spectacular too. As is the long, sweeping curve of the viaduct crossing the Tweed at Berwick.\nRivers define the North East’s physical geography. And in recent years, our politics too.\nPeople on both sides of the Tyne cross it to get to work, go for a night out, see friends and family. The Metro currently has 60 stations. 36 of them north of the Tyne. 24 to the south. But politics hasn’t caught up. Until now.\nThe ‘North of Tyne’ was always a slightly artificial construct. A necessary first step to show local politicians that devolution brings benefits. But the North East needed more.\nThat’s why I fought so hard to bridge the divide and bring the South of Tyne into the new devolution accord. A bigger, better deal. The best-funded deal in England. A deal that gives the people of Sunderland, Gateshead, South Tyneside, and County Durham the same resources and opportunities that people north of the Tyne already have. And more.\nOur Brownfield Housing Fund is enabling 2,133 homes to be built. Most of them are north of the Tyne, but we’ve now got an extra £17 million to spend south of the Tyne. Cleaning up industrial sites so they are fit for house-building means more homes can be built. It also reduces the pressure to develop on green belt land. New sites have already been signed off in Hebburn.\nNew capital investment, agreed as part of the North East devolution deal, is already coming online. My cabinet and I have signed off £3.5 million in additional funding for the Gateshead Quays International Conference Centre and associated cluster of hotels and restaurants.\n£9.2 million for the Aykley Heads Innovation District in Durham, already home to existing businesses like Atom Bank, the UK’s first app-based bank.\n£10.7 million to help expand NETPark in Sedgefield. A centre for science with bespoke lab space, office space and clean rooms. More good jobs and opportunities to build a career locally.\nOn top of the devolution deal money we have the new North East Investment Zone negotiated with government, worth £160 million over ten years. It’s designed to support growth in advanced manufacturing and green industries. And the capacity to attract 10,000 skilled jobs.\nIt’ll cover four sites. Blyth Energy Central and the banks of the River Tyne, to boost the offshore wind sector. The International Advanced Manufacturing Park in Washington where a battery gigafactory is already under construction. And NETPark, with high-tech and low-carbon innovation. When we talk about a Green New Deal creating good jobs, this is it, in action.\nJust like the rest of the devolution deal none of this will cost local residents anything – at least not with me as Mayor. I haven’t charged a penny in council tax in five years, and if re-elected, I won’t again. But all of this funding was dependent on uniting the region in the new devolution deal.\nIt also proves that devolution is not Newcastle-centric. Investments and opportunities are already being spread throughout the North East, from Berwick to Sedgefield.\nAnd with the new transport powers and funding we’ll be able to build a Total Transport Network. London-style fully integrated public transport under public control. With cross-ticketing on Metro, bus, rail and ferry. Low fares for everyone, and free travel for young people 18 and under. Every city, town and village connected by buses, the Metro and rail system, including the new Northumberland Line that opens later this year. No longer will jobs be out of reach for people who can’t afford a car. No longer will socialising cease at 6pm. It’ll also lower traffic for everyone. A real win-win.\nLast week, I gave approval for Government to start the Parliamentary business of merging the North of Tyne into the new North East Combined Authority. Investment and opportunities for everyone running right across the North East.\nOur rivers should not keep us apart. Like our spectacular bridges, devolution should bring us together.",

We feel the need, the need for speed.\nTop Gun: Maverick did not disappoint.\nNow, I’m no film critic; Maverick may not be your cup of tea. But there’s something about a cinema blockbuster that you just can’t experience at home.\nYour seat rumbles as the fighter jets roar past. Almost ducking because the big screen fills your vision. The magic of a shared experience when the audience laugh at the same jokes and gasp at the same stunts.\nCritics have described Top Gun: Maverick as the last stand against streaming. A film conceived to be watched in cinemas. The footage of the pilots was filmed inside actual F-18 fighter jets. No CGI, no green screens. When Maverick is launched from an aircraft carrier, Tom Cruise’s head jolts forwards in a way that can’t be acted. The film and the character share the same defining quality: they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore. It’s nostalgia done beautifully.\nDennis Waterman’s death a couple of weeks ago led to a conversation around the Driscoll dinner table. In 1984, at a time when the UK population was just over 56 million, over 16 million of us tuned in to watch a single episode of Minder. That’s more than one in four of the entire population doing exactly the same thing at the same time. And then talking about it the next day. The boys were amazed.\nCaroline and I tried to explain to the boys – now 16 and 14 – what watching telly was like in the 80’s. There were adverts, and you couldn’t fast forward through them. The whole family watched it in the living room at the same time. We thought remote controls were flash – before that if you wanted to change the volume, you had to get up and press a button the TV set. The idea of watching on your phone? The phone was a big clunky device that lived in the hall and needed its own table. When you answered it you introduced yourself and possibly recited your number.\nWhat are our shared experiences in an era of internet shopping, working from home and streaming TV?\nPerhaps that’s behind the centrifugal force weakening the UK’s identity. Scotland may leave. Northern Ireland may follow. For the first time since the middle ages, self-determination for England’s regions is on the agenda.\nThe English word “patriot” derives from “compatriot” – fellow countryman. George Orwell contrasted patriotism with nationalism. “By ‘patriotism’ I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force upon other people.” Nationalism, Orwell said, was about one group subjugating another.\nPatriotism is about making your homeland a better place to live. Serving in our armed forces to protect us. Working in our public services, keeping us safe on a double bank holiday weekend. Volunteering for charities. Or serving as a local councillor, not for recognition or reward, but from civic duty.\nOur nostalgic, rose-coloured view of Britain ‘pulling together’ overlooks what it feels like to be excluded from the community. Whether through poverty or bigotry, our government is a past master at that. Ask any of the Windrush generation.\nThere’s a map of Britain’s foodbanks trending on social media. You know the kind of Google Map where a pin represents a location. The UK is submerged in food banks. I’m simultaneously proud that Britons are stepping up to help their fellows. And ashamed that we need to.\nThat’s another change since I was my sons’ age. Despite growing in Teesside in an era of mass unemployment, there were no foodbanks, no homeless people sleeping in subways.\nSome newspapers and politicians stoke culture wars to distract and divide. Dr Johnson said “Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.” He was wrong. It’s usually the first.\nThe challenge we face is to find cultural unity based on our common humanity.\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 6 June 22",

He wanted to catch the natural light. He liked the books in the background of my home office / spare room. We took some pics in the garden. And important questions – like should I suck my stomach in? “I would in your position,” he said. Harsh, but fair.\nThe photos were for a profile piece following on from the recent North East devolution announcement, confirming a £4.27bn deal for a combined authority area stretching from Berwick to Barnard Castle – a lovely town with not one, but two opticians.\nWe’d done the actual interview the day before, over the phone. In fact, I’d submitted an opinion piece highlighting what we’ve delivered in the North of Tyne. It’s important to fly the flag of the region, and remind the rest of the UK that the North does not stop at the M62. The North East has the potential to be an economic powerhouse. If we can get the up-front investment, it pays for itself many times over.\nThe journalist rang me, asking could they follow it with a profile piece? So we spoke about the deal, and the future of the North East.\nLevelling-up and devolution aren’t the same thing. Devolution is about moving power and budgets away from Westminster. Levelling-up is about reducing inequality. And you can’t do it on the cheap. The deal is very welcome, but it won’t give nurses a pay rise or restore our council funding. As I said, “If you’ve seen your library close and leisure centre close and now your social care is crumbling, it’s only human to see devolution as giving a fiver with one hand while taking a tenner with the other.”\nAs devolution deals go, it compares well against other regions. When it comes to the core investment funds, the West Midlands gets £36.5 million a year for 2.9 million people. Greater Manchester gets £30m for 2.8m people. West Yorkshire gets £38m for 2.3m people. The new East Midlands deal is £38m for 2.2m people. We’re getting £48 million a year for 2 million people. It’s the biggest fund in England despite being the fifth largest in population. As regional leaders I think we’ve done a good job for the North East. This is the only funding route available for strategic devolved investment. If the deal is rejected, the money disappears back to Treasury; they won’t divide it between our councils. The investment fund comes with other money for housing, transport and skills training, worth £1bn in total in the first three years.\nThe journalist wanted to check some biographical facts from Wikipedia. It’s wise to check, I told him. Caroline was looking at her phone one evening and said, “It says here you have four children.” We don’t, we have two. “Is there something you want to tell me?” Although why she was looking me up on Wikipedia I’m still not sure.\nMind you, one online source says I made “between $3 million and $5 million” from Yeezy sneakers “enough to rank as one of the biggest celebrity cashouts of all time.” Honestly, you couldn’t make it up. Oh hang on…\nThey were keen to go with the news line that I get on with Michael Gove. The Financial Times had rang up with same angle. I work well professionally with him, I told them, and other ministers too, that’s how you get things done. I’m there to get results for the people I represent. But I don’t share his politics.\nIt’s up to the media to find ways of working that serve the public good. I think politicians should answer questions directly and perhaps share a little of what makes them tick. But don’t believe everything you read on the internet. For the record, my waistline is on a need to know basis.",

My younger son, now 13, clad only in a T-shirt and cagoule jacket.\n“How are you going to keep warm in that? You’ll freeze!” I told him. “I’m a Geordie,” he replied. He was right too. Maybe it’s the energy of youth, running up and sliding down a bank. I even taught him the age-old art of “plaggy bagging” – using a bin liner as an improvised sledge that you steer by shifting your bodyweight.\nGeordies are legendary for hardiness. Venturing out in T-shirts or short skirts when there’s ice on the ground. It’s exaggerated, but based on a grain of truth. The stereotype has taken hold.\nThe rest of the country knows it’s been snowing because it made the news. There must have been a light dusting of snow in Surrey or Kent. Snow up here is less of a story. Anything up here is less of a story.\nWe face regional imbalances in pretty much everything.\nLast week I met with the Research & Development Minister. R&D leads to innovation, the creation of productive industries, and interesting, well-paid jobs. Without it, there’d be no Covid vaccine, for a start.\nLondon, Oxford, and Cambridge account for 46% of the UK’s public and charitable R&D, but just 21% of the population. And I doubt you’ll be surprised that over 70% of capital investment in research infrastructure between 2007 and 2014 were made in London, the East and South East.\nIn the North of Tyne, in a relatively short time, we’ve been backing some exciting projects with devolved funding. Like our Advancing Circular Economy project, joint with industry. It develops environmentally sustainable replacements for household products – detergents, for example. It creates high-paid, high-tech jobs in the process.\nYou may have seen the Ken Loach film, I, Daniel Blake, where he struggles to apply for jobs online. 53% of our people lack the skills or equipment to access online services. Compared that to 35% in the South East. In the North East only 18% of people are highly engaged internet users. In the South East it’s 49%.\nSo we’ve partnered with Newcastle’s National Innovation Centre for Data to support digital adoption for 800 North East businesses. And bought £650,000 of kit so disadvantaged school kids can access lessons online.\nI had a second Ministerial last week – with a Minister from The Department of Culture, Media and Sport. I spend a lot of my time speaking up for our region. In Culture and the Arts, the North East economy benefits £72 per person. London benefits £311 per person. The good news is the Minister agreed to my proposal for my team to work with Whitehall civil servants to address this.\nCommunity arts funding from the Lottery is £50.40 per person in London. In the rest of England, it’s £21.26. We’re making some progress here too. Our Spacehive is matching North of Tyne money with Lottery funds to get community projects off the ground.\nWe are paving the way – but if government is serious about levelling up, they need to match warm words with hard cash.\nLast week saw the sad news that Mary Wilson died. She co-founded The Supremes, and like the rest of Motown, influenced many British musicians. I remember reading a piece on how The Jam wrote Town Called Malice. Bruce Foxton, the bassist, acknowledged that the bass line closely resembles You Can’t Hurry Love by The Supremes. It’s a link few would make, but it hits you as soon as you listen to both tracks.\nTown Called Malice describes a left behind town, something the North East understands all too well. The way the grind of poverty affects relationships and life chances.\nThe Southern establishment imagines Geordies wearing T-shirts in the snow. They see the whole North as bleating about being hard done to. We are, but that argument has cut no ice for forty years. So I always offer a solution – how investment will empower us to generate wealth here.\nLike the song says, “I could go on for hours, and I probably will, but I’d sooner put some joy back in this town called Malice\nOriginally Published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 15.2.21",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_a-fair-days-pay-for-a-fair-days-work/content_210.html": "A Fair Days Pay For a Fair Days Work\nNovember 8, 2020\nIn my first few months in office, I made the North of Tyne an accredited Living Wage employer. We’re a small organisation, mainly highly skilled workers already on more than £9.30 an hour. But it did affect the cleaners, receptionists and security staff who maintain the building. We also have a gender pay gap of zero – the men and the women get the same median pay. It was another manifesto pledge, and we’re rattling through delivering them, despite the extreme disruption caused by Covid. Living Wage Week 2020 starts today (9th Nov). It celebrates the 6,500 UK employers UK who do the right thing pay their workers the Real Living Wage. For 2019/20, the Real Living Wage was £9.30 per hour. Next year’s figure is out soon. The amount is calculated on what people actually need to live on, without falling into debt. It accounts for food, clothes, bills, transport and housing. Compare it to the legal minimum wage of £8.21 for the same period, and you can see it makes a huge difference to the low paid. It was an act of deception when the government renamed the minimum wage the “National Living Wage” – it’s not. Which is why we still need the Living Wage Foundation to look at the reality of living with low pay. The Real Living Wage applies to all workers, even those under 25. Under the minimum wage, they can legally be paid as little as £4.55 an hour. People should be paid for the work they do, not discriminated against because of their age.\nEveryone should be paid enough to live decently and provide for their family. No-one should experience the indignity of in-work poverty or low wage exploitation. Yet 21% of all workers across the UK, including 60,000 in the North of Tyne, are still paid less than the £9.30 per hour. It’s a false economy – it causes hardship, and is directly correlated to health problems and educational entertainment. Public services then have to pick up the strain. Low pay affects us all.\nA fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work: it is as just a demand as goverened men ever made of Government.\nThomas Carlyle\nThere’s an indelible moral case for paying the Real Living Wage. But there’s also a sound economic case. Good employers have realized that paying the Real Living Wage is good for business. In 2017, The Living Wage Foundation surveyed 800 employers who had signed up. An amazing 93% reported their business had benefited from paying higher wages. Increased motivation, lower days off sick, and higher staff retention were all good for productivity. Many of our local employers have realized this and have signed up. There are now 59 accredited employers representing over 33,000 employees across North of Tyne area. And I’d like to give a special mention to Sunderland City Council, who’ve joined us as an accredited Living Wage Employer – no mean feat, given the brutal assault on local government finance.\nThis week we’re also launching the North of Tyne Good Work Pledge. To qualify, employers have to demonstrate they’re not using exploitative contracts, they’re paying the Real Living Wage, they look after their staff wellbeing, have career development opportunities, and engage with their workers, including recognising trade unions. We’ll be linking this to public sector procurement so that companies wanting to bid for work will need to be good employers.\nDecent pay is also good news for the local economy. When billionaires get a 10% income increase, it ends up in tax havens. Give an ordinary worker a 10% pay increase, and they decorate the back bedroom, or go out to a gig at a local venue. Their spending creates jobs for local people. Received wisdom says that internet shopping is killing our high streets. That’s undoubtedly a factor. But too few people have any money left after paying bills and debts. Zero hours contracts are a third higher in the North East than the UK average. Low paid and part-time workers are five times more likely than other workers to be furloughed on reduced pay. I’ve lobbied hard to have a floor on furlough – so no one gets less than minimum wage. People simply can’t get by on 80% of £8.72 an hour.\nA fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. That’s not too much to ask is it?\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 9.11.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_live-your-life-with-purpose/content_228.html": "Live Your Life With Purpose\nApril 26, 2021\nStewart Lee was once given some advice on how to earn a living in the transient world of stand-up comedy. “You get 5000 people to like you, and they all give you £10 a year. That’s a living.\n”It’s a risk, pursuing your passion. And it’s not an easy option, as any established musician or actor will testify. Honing skill and building experience takes hard graft. It’s not surprising that most people are encouraged to go for a secure job.\nYoung people are not getting the chance to take a chance. Students now graduate with debts exceeding £50k. Housing costs are so high that unless they can draw on the bank of Mam & Dad, there’s no time to learn the ropes. Working class kids are priced out of following their passion.\nThe flip side is the rise of automation and proliferation of the gig economy. Workers of all ages are feeling the insecurity. Manual and clerical jobs are being replaced with robots and algorithms. The nature of work has been changing for a while. Many “self-employed” or flexible hours jobs were sold with the promise of being your own boss. But too many are finding themselves on a timesheet treadmill. They take the risks of no money coming in, and get only a tiny share of the rewards if business booms.\nThe passion economy celebrates individuality and a hunger to do what you love. Digital platforms like Kickstarter, Patreon and Buy Me A Coffee allow people to earn money from niche creative ideas. In fact, finding that niche idea is a cornerstone described by Adam Davidson in his book, The Passion Economy. Find an idea that’s too small for corporates to bother with, then make it your own. You might only have a few dozen clients, but if you pick the right idea, it could work.\nThe Japanese idea of Ikigai embodies the idea of living your life with purpose. As with most Japanese translation into English, the nuance is difficult to capture. The western interpretation is depicted as a Venn diagram with four overlapping aspects of life. What you love; what you are good at; what the world needs; and what you can be paid for. Or, in other words, find something you love to do, and you’ll never have to work a day in your life.\nOnce I started looking, I saw evidence of this passion economy everywhere. One of my friends set up Sobersistas, which offers support to women who want to control their drinking. Another friend used to teach MMA, giving one-to-one tuition to City of London types. He’s now gone on to set up a successful MMA gym in Newcastle. I’m sure you know people who have had the bravery to follow a passion, maybe you are one of them.\nThe pandemic and lockdown has got a lot of people thinking about their work. Health, economic growth and jobs are all intertwined now. Do you really want to work 9-5? Maybe you do, maybe you don’t. What has been unlocked is seeing what is possible. I’ve seen reports that through furlough and lockdown, tens of thousands of people are considering starting part-time businesses, pursuing their passions\n.I’m keen to support people brave enough to set up on their own. At the Combined Authority our Digital Adoption programme provides technical know-how for people to run businesses. Just Google, “North of Tyne digital adoption”. Our Creative and Cultural fund that will be onstream soon, to support freelancers and creative businesses.\nNot everyone can take such a risk, though. Stagnant wages and rising costs mean too few people get to build up any savings. If you’ve got kids to feed and rent to pay, that regular pay day has a lot going for it. We need to make all jobs more fulfilling. The unleashing of human creativity is one of the strongest arguments for Universal Basic Income. Giving people the freedom to set-up a creative business, or the opportunity to re-skill for a new career, would benefit us all.\nIt’s a vision for the future. But like all futures, some of it exists in the present.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 26.4.2021",

He had an extraordinary ability to persuade people to part with their cash.\nMadoff was asked how he could guarantee such consistently high returns. “I’m not giving away my trade secrets” he’d say, followed by some flim-flam.\nIf anyone wanted their money back, he’d write them a cheque. Money back, plus all the profits they were promised. Word spread that the payouts were real. He’d show investors charts and statistics showing how well things were going.\nIt went on for years. People said the normal rules didn’t apply to him. He was some kind of genius.\nThe thing was, he’d done absolutely sod all with the money. He just stuck it in Chase-Manhatten Bank, and lived the high life. Expensive homes in New York, Florida and France. A big yacht.\nHow did he make the payouts? He took it from the cash pile. As long as ever more people invested, he could keep up the lie. Failure was inevitable. When the scheme collapsed in 2008, investors lost a whopping $64.8 billion.\nLast week’s no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the sound of a political Ponzi scheme collapsing under the weight of its broken promises.\nHe lied about Partygate, of course. More promises and bigger lies, to cover up the other lies. He got caught because, well, he was actually guilty. So now they claim “He got the big calls right”.\nBut did he?\nRemember “oven ready” Brexit? That the UK could leave the European Single Market without jeopardising the Good Friday Agreement? Now they’re talking about breaking the treaty they negotiated, risking a trade war with the EU. Not to mention the queues at ports and airports.\nRemember “levelling up”? We were promised Northern Powerhouse Rail. In writing. Instead we’ve got rail chaos, driver shortages, and signal failures. And a national rail strike because budgets have been slashed and wages frozen.\nHe ignored the first five COBRA meetings, locked down late, causing an estimated 20,000 extra deaths. Remember the failed test and trace system that cost £37 billion? That an inquiry described as “an eye watering waste of money”.\nRemember the dodgy deals for PPE? Ministers’ friends getting multi-million pound contracts for equipment that couldn’t be used. Over £4 billion worth of useless PPE has literally been burned.\nWe keep being told the vaccine rollout was better in Britain. Check the facts. I just have. As of 1st June, Our World in Data, from Oxford University, lists the percentage of population fully vaccinated. In Europe, the UK is behind Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Iceland, Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Greece.\nSchool exam chaos. Petrol has topped £100 per tank full. Foodbank use topped 2 million people a year. Fuel bills at a record high. Inflation passing 10%. National Insurance hikes for working people.\nWhat sickens me most is him flying to Kyiv in a cynical attempt to save his own job. Yet he rewarded Vladimir Putin’s oligarchs with special favours like a seat in the House of Lords.\nThe morning after the no-confidence vote, I was interviewed by LBC’s Nick Ferrari. He was expecting me to put the boot in. No point, his own party are doing that anyway. And people need hope.\nMr Johnson became PM two months after I became Mayor.\nWe’re ten years ahead of the government target in our devolution deal. 4,586 good quality jobs in the pipeline, all underpinned by our Good Work Pledge.\nDespite the pandemic, we’ve funded more training courses. Over 25,000, from HGV driving to computer coding, giving our young people a chance to earn a good living. We’ve built houses with our Brownfield Housing Fund. And we work directly with communities, funding projects like community food gardens from Hexham to Heaton, and beach wheelchairs in Cullercoats.\nEconomic competence is possible. Compassionate policies are deliverable. But not if you run government like a Ponzi scheme. Like Bernie Madoff, Boris Johnson made promises people wanted to believe. When he couldn’t deliver them, he made more promises, and told more lies.\nWith energy prices so high, all this gaslighting must be costing him a fortune.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 13 June 22",

Will Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak replace him?” Both, was the answer. 2022 turned out to be the year of three different Prime Ministers. Something the country last experienced 170 years ago.\nBut whoever’s in power the same problems need fixing. And this government seems to have given up trying. Despite the Brexit rhetoric they’re not willing to ‘take back control’ and tackle the cost-of-living crisis. They hide behind pay review bodies. Train operating companies. “Global headwinds.” Excuse after excuse.\nMillions of people are struggling to pay their bills. Workers are forced to go on strike to avoid real-terms pay cuts. Businesses are struggling to stay afloat. Child poverty is spiralling. Savings are evaporating. Debts are mounting.\nThe first step to recovery is admitting that you’ve got a problem. Blaming everyone else doesn’t cut it.\nSo what could the government do instead?\nWell first of all – you can’t cut your way to success. You don’t improve people’s lives by axing services they rely on. Austerity sucked the life out of much of our local resilience the first time around. We don’t need a reboot. Every time a child grows up hungry you’re knocking points off economic growth, while simultaneously ignoring that family’s suffering.\nInvestment is critical. You don’t create jobs out of thin air. The services we rely on are not just about emergency response. Health, education and transport are the long-term foundation of wealth generation. You don’t bring energy bills down by relying on foreign fossil fuels. You don’t improve productivity by forcing people into insecure jobs.\nIndustrial disputes didn’t cause our economy to fail – it’s our failing economy that’s causing the industrial disputes. Railway workers, nurses, and posties are reasonable people. They’re not asking for golden wallpaper. They want what we all want – to be paid properly for the job they do. We called them ‘key workers’ and clapped for them during the worst of the pandemic. We cannot abandon them now.\nWe know what’s true for the North East is true for the rest of the country. Our region’s economic decline was caused by disinvestment. We can only fix that by putting money back in – investing in businesses, infrastructure, and people.\nInvest now, save later. Every £1 invested by the North of Tyne returns over £3 to the Treasury in payroll taxes alone – income tax and National Insurance. And that’s not counting the health, wealth, and education benefits to families of having skilled workers in good jobs.\nOur current devolution deal says we’ve got to create 10,000 new jobs over 30 years. 3 and a half years in and we should have 1,200 jobs in the pipeline. We’ve actually got 4,685. And we saved another 2,643 by investing in firms during the pandemic.\nThat’s 14 years’ progress in 3 and a half years.\nWith a deeper deal on a wider footprint we can do even more when the new North East devolution is signed into law.\n170 years ago the British Empire was in crisis. Ireland was just emerging from the Great Famine. One million people had died from starvation and disease. Two million had emigrated. A fifth of the country’s people gone. Ireland’s population has never fully recovered.\nA famine is not simply a natural disaster. It’s the result of human action or inaction to prevent it. The Government in Westminster at best did too little, at worst exacerbated the problem.\nThat’s the nightmare scenario. But the drip drip effect of hoarding power and resources in the centre means potential lies fallow in the regions. It’s not just crops that are at risk of blight. People’s talents are being wasted.\nSoon after the year of 3 Prime Ministers Charles Dickens wrote ‘A Tale of Two Cities’. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times”. We don’t want a country permanently divided between rich and poor. We need a new doctrine of universal wealth generation: where no place and no person is left behind.\nThat’s the challenge for 2023. Like the fireworks on New Year’s Eve, if we work together we can light up the sky.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-have-the-unions-ever-done-for-us/content_244.html": "What Have The Unions Ever Done For Us\nMarch 22, 2021\nWhen I was a ward councillor for Monument – Newcastle City Centre – our police liaison officers showed exemplary sensitivity and emotional intelligence when dealing with challenging members of the public. We know, though, that any organisation can have bad individuals in it – serving police officer Wayne Couzens has been charged with the murder of Sarah Everard.\nThat’s the age-old question, asked by the Roman satirist Juvenal: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – roughly translated as “who will police the police?”\nHome Secretary Priti Patel’s response is that she shall police herself. The Crime Bill going through Parliament gives her the power to make new laws without new acts of Parliament, and decide what should constitute illegal protest.\nThe legislation will make “serious annoyance” illegal. A judge will be able to jail a person for up to 10 years. A police officer will be given powers to take “such conditions as appear necessary” to that officer “to prevent disorder, damage, disruption, impact or intimidation.\n”Did you notice the word “impact” snuck in there? What the hell is the point of a protest that has no impact? “Down with this sort of thing,” and “Careful now” will be the only actions allowed. The legislation should be renamed the Father Ted Bill.\nIt took until 2012 for the Hillsborough families to get justice for the 1989 tragedy. For years, senior police officers and the sitting government covered up the facts, lied, and shifted the blame. Just seven miles down the road is Orgreave,a site of another police cover up blamed on the victims, with the collusion of hostile elements of the media. I bet many people reading are still influenced by the early media propaganda – that somehow Liverpool fans were to blame for Hillsborough, or miners for the injuries at Orgreave.\nIn their 2019 campaign, the Conservatives included a plan to outlaw people withdrawing their labour in protest over their pay or working conditions. It used the example of transport, because it’s a key service. There are around 1.5 million transport workers in the UK’s 32 million strong workforce. But most workers could be categorised essential under such a law. Health workers, education employees, refuse workers, retail workers, delivery staff, postal and telecomms. The right to withdraw your labour – to strike – is a foundation stone of a free society. There’s a name for that, it’s called forced labour.\nTrade unions were only decriminalised in 1875. They were tied up with reforms to voting rights. For centuries, working people who didn’t own land could not vote. Because you didn’t own part of the country, ran the argument, you got no say in its future. Today most people don’t get a vote on how their workplace is run – because they don’t own part of it. Despite the fact that it’s their skill, time and energy that make the organisation function. Enlightened employers know that engaging their workers benefits everyone – staff, owners and customers. The Bank of England’s Chief Economist, Andy Haldane, said the anti-trade union laws had lowered workers wages across the economy.\nThe real trick that’s been played on the British people is this idea that Trade Unions are separate from working people. To paraphrase Monty Python, “what have trade unions ever done for us?”\nFor a start, unions stopped child labour. Unionised workplaces are safer, with 50% fewer accidents. Every year unions train 10,000 safety reps. Union members earn, on average, 12.5 per cent more than non-members. They have better job security, and stay in their jobs for an average of five years longer than non-members. Unionised workplaces have higher productivity and fewer industrial tribunals.\nApart from that, though, trade unions have only gained us paid holidays, maternity and paternity leave, paid sick leave, equal pay legislation, pensions, and workplace anti-discrimination laws. Oh, and the weekend. It was unions that fought for a five day working week.\nAnd, of course, furlough was a result of unions negotiating with the government. We’ve all benefited by keeping the economy afloat.\nThe good news is that trade union membership is rising – with a net increase of 200,000 over the past three years. Why not join them?\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 22.3.21",

Whereas if you put it into tepid water and heat it up, the frog will not notice, and passively be boiled to death. Firstly, don’t try this at home. Secondly, it’s not true.\nIt comes from an 1869 experiment by Friedrich Goltz. He discovered that a frog will jump out of water once it is heated to 25 degrees C. But a frog with its brain removed will do nothing, and be boiled to death. This leads to two thoughts. Firstly, did it really take an experiment to discover that removing a frog’s brain impairs its survival instincts? Secondly, why is humanity behaving like a brainless frog?\nI refer, of course, to COP26 and the impending climate catastrophe. “Keep 1.5 alive” has as much meaning as “levelling up” or “make America great again”. Optimism is not a policy. If we look at the actual real-world policies, Climate Action Tracker says we’ll see a global temperature increase of between 2 degrees and 3.5 degrees, with a 50% chance of 2.7 degrees.\nWhat do those numbers mean? Well, in the depths of the last ice age, global temperatures were 5 degrees lower. Newcastle was under an ice sheet 300 metres thick.\nWe’re already 1.2 degrees warmer, and it’s causing floods, droughts, forest fires, sea ice to melt and sea levels to start rising.\nThe North China Plain is twice the size of Britain. It’s home to 400 million people, and the source of much of China’s food. If global temperatures increase by 2.9 degrees, they will experience extreme heatwaves by 2070. Heatwaves so hot that a healthy adult, sitting still in the shade, will die within six hours. Children and the elderly much sooner. Similar effects will be seen across India, Africa, coastal cities in the Middle East, and Central America. What do we think will happen when food production collapses? States will fail, civil wars will run rampant, and people will flee. The world economy as we know it will collapse. Their problems are our problems. Yet this is the policy path our planet is currently on.\nDespite the spin, it’s not simply the fault of other countries. How many of the clothes on sale here were made in Britain? Or the electronics? Or even our food. 50% of the UK’s food comes from abroad. Covid showed us the vulnerability of our food supply chain. If we’re offshoring our emissions, we share responsibility.\nAnd we have to cancel the Cambo oilfield off Shetland, the coal mine in Cumbria, and drilling for oil in Surrey. In the North of Tyne we’re creating thousands of well-paid, economically-viable, low-carbon jobs. Government can create hundreds of thousands more if they want to.\nTwo things have come out of the Glasgow climate summit. A failure to meet the promise of $100bn a year to help decarbonise developing economies. And a failure to even agree we should stop burning coal at some point.\nWhat COP26 needed to do was agree a plan to phase-out all fossil fuel production, starting immediately. Replacing it with energy efficiency and renewables. Instead we got “efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and a phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. There are more qualifiers in that sentence than Andorra’s route to the World Cup.\nIn 2009, at COP15, rich nations promised developing nations $100bn a year to decarbonise their economies. Much of that would be spent, of course, buying technology from Western owned corporations. Glasgow’s COP26 failed to deliver that. The IMF reported that last year, fossil fuel subsidies were $5.9 trillion. We can’t even find $100bn to save our own planet, when it’s only 6 days worth of fossil fuel subsidies.\nWhy did COP26 fail? Because like the brainless frog, our Prime Minister and other world leaders are seduced by creeping normality. The idea of tackling the vested interests of billionaires seems more shocking to them than our civilisation collapsing. So they bathe in the warming waters of kick-backs, paid consultancies, and a revolving door of corporate directorships once they’ve served their time in office. We’d be safer with a frog in charge.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 15 Nov 2021",

Boris Johnson is on the ropes. Will Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak replace him? Who will wield the knife? Yada, yada. It might seem surprising, but I don’t really care who is Prime Minister. Not as an end in itself, anyway. I’m far more interested in what Governments actually do.\nOver two years ago the Conservative election manifesto promised to “level up” every part of the UK. What does that mean?\nPage 29 said, “This is an agenda which shows that the days of Whitehall knows best are over. We will give towns, cities and communities of all sizes across the UK real power and real investment to drive the growth and the future and unleash their full potential.” And “We will publish an English Devolution White Paper setting out our plans next year” i.e. 2020. It’s now 2022, and still no White Paper on English Devolution.\nThere may be a “Levelling Up” White Paper out this month. There’s certainly a lot of talk about it. Whether it delivers what’s promised is a different matter. The same manifesto promised “We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail” (p27). That promise was broken in the recent (Dis)Integrated Rail Plan. Mind you, in September they broke their headline promise that “We will not raise the rate of income tax, VAT or National Insurance” (p2), with the National Insurance increases.\nThere has been a pandemic. I’ll understate the obvious and say that has been a serious distraction. But it’s not a ‘get out of jail free’ pass for the Government.\nI’d only been mayor for ten months, and still building a brand new Combined Authority team, when lockdown happened. It hasn’t stopped us from smashing our targets. Creating thousands of jobs. Training tens of thousands of people in new skills. Implementing our Green New Deal. It hasn’t stopped me delivering over half of my manifesto, despite being only half way through my term of office.\nSo for me, this year’s big issue is: will we in the North East get the level of independence we need to secure our own future? I will agree with the Tory manifesto on one thing: if we leave decision making in Whitehall, the North East will continue to miss out.\nI’ve been working behind the scenes, and advocating publicly, for wider North East devolution since I was elected in May 2019. We need to speak with one voice.\nDecision making has to reside at the right level. To quote Plato, “we must carve nature at the joints.” International law and war crimes should reside with the UN and International Criminal Court. Foreign policy should be the responsibility of national Government. Income and corporation tax should also be national, to prevent a race to the bottom.\nEconomic development, though, works best at the functional economic area. In most places, that’s the conurbation and its rural hinterland. Buses, metros, trams and local rail work best at the city region level, simply because 80% of all journeys occur on that geography.\nI’ve heard rumours that the latest draft of the White Paper proposes the creation of a statutory levelling-up quango. That’s precisely what we don’t need – another layer of government in Westminster to oversee the de-layering of government.\nWhat we do need is the devolved power to make our own decisions in the North.\nDevolution needs to be a constant work-in-progress, though, not a tick box exercise.\nYou remember the Monty Python sketch, “what have the Romans ever done for us?” I’m asking what will devolution do for us?\nDevolution means good jobs – proper, career-level jobs.\nPaying higher-than-average wages.\nEliminating unemployment.\nAffordable housing.\nImproving our already-thriving cultural scene.\nDecarbonising our economy and restoring biodiversity.\nFaster and more reliable public transport.\nCreating a region – economic and cultural – that means our young people want to stay and make their lives here.\nAnd significant financial independence, meaning that money generated in the region stays in the region.\nIf we can get all that, I don’t really care which Tory MP replaces Boris Johnson.\nOriginally published in The Journal and Evening Chronicle 3 Jan 2022",

People are suffering.\nIn 21st century Britain our daily lives depend on a functioning power system. We can be stoic about losing Netflix for a week. But boilers and central heating systems use electric pumps and control systems. Wrapping up warm is easier said than done for families with babies or the elderly. Kids can’t properly study by torchlight, and anyone working from home or their business is likely to need a computer or electrical equipment. Access to the internet requires wifi. At the very least a charged mobile phone. And mobility devices from chair lifts to wheelchairs need power. Not to mention electric vehicles and spoiled food in freezers. I spoke to one family who use a septic tank in their rural home. Their pump is electric.\nI’m hearing great reports of communities looking after each other, and helping out vulnerable neighbours. Thank you to everyone who is showing kindness and generosity. But no one should be in the position of needing wonderful neighbours simply to live their life. Especially when you’ve paid your electricity bill.\nThe last thing we need is politicians posing with pictures of fallen trees or downed powerlines. Getting in the way of recovery efforts. Better to keep out of the way of the engineers and technicians doing their job on the ground. They’re working long hours in difficult and dangerous conditions. A big thank you to everyone involved.\nBut who runs our electricity supply?\nIt’s been fragmented since privatisation in 1990. A multitude of companies run the power plants. National Grid PLC run the large pylons, and are responsible for making sure there’s enough total power going into the grid at any given time. The local distribution networks are responsible for maintaining the connection between the national grid and your premises. In the North East, that’s a monopoly held by Northern Powergrid (Northeast).\nThen there’s the electricity retailers. They buy and sell electricity to customers, but don’t generate it or maintain the infrastructure. I’ve lost track of the number who’ve gone bust. It’s approaching 30. A system requires us to use our spare time to switch suppliers to stop being overcharged is a broken system in the first place.\nThe whole lot is overseen by OfGem, the regulator. Government gives OfGem limited powers. Fining companies after the event is no substitute for making them get it right and preventing a crisis.\nI met with OfGem in August. As we deal with the climate emergency, we know storms will become more frequent and more intense. We also know that shifting to electric vehicles, green hydrogen, and heat pumps will place more demand on the grid. Our current grid is inadequate to this challenge. In fact, it’s not even resilient enough to deal with one storm. I’ve called for a major review.\nNorthern Powergrid (Northeast) is owned by Northern Powergrid Holdings, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, previously known as MidAmercian Energy Holdings Company, which is 90% owned by Berkshire Hathaway, which is run by Warren Buffet, who has a personal net worth of $102 billion.\nA quick look at Northern Powergrid (Northeast)’s accounts shows an operating profit of £125 million on a turnover of £355 million. That’s 35% of revenue taken as operating profit. Before tax, £93 million a year leaves our region instead of being reinvested.\nI can’t help thinking there’s a better system.\nI want companies and organisations to make a profit. It’s essential that they have money left over to invest in new equipment, in staff training, and maintaining a financial reserve. But in company accounting, that’s already been included in the operating expenses. As have the salaries and bonuses of the executives and board members.\nOur electricity system is essential infrastructure. We have to invest in it. It’s also a natural monopoly. We need a system whose primary goal is to create a resilient, environmentally sustainable electricity system. No one should be suffering weeks without electricity. If that £93 million a year was invested into resilience, we’d be a lot better prepared for a stormy future.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_does-it-have-to-be-higher-taxes-or-more-borrowing/content_25.html": "Does it have to be higher taxes or more borrowing?\nFebruary 4, 2024\nIf we want better services, we’re told, it’s either higher taxes, or more debt. We’re told it so often – by the Government and the Opposition – that journalists don’t even challenge it. We just get cliché bingo. “We haven’t got a magic money tree.” Or, “You can’t pay the rent on the credit card.” Metaphors that imply cuts and low wages are somehow an inevitable law of nature. They’re not.\nAs North of Tyne Mayor I’ve raised no taxes and borrowed no money. I have the power to do both. I can put a precept on the council tax bills. But I think North East householders pay enough tax. Especially in the middle of a cost of living crisis.\nThat’s why for the fifth year in a row I have set the Mayoral precept at £0. I haven’t borrowed any money either. Zero tax raised from residents. Zero pounds borrowed.\nYet in my first term as Mayor, our programmes are creating 5,377 jobs. Building 1,948 homes on brownfield sites. Running child poverty prevention programmes in 100 schools. Training over 35,000 people a year to get better jobs and earn more. Not to mention youth centres re-opened, festivals and culture venues sponsored, and funds for community projects from rewilding to repair cafes.\nSo have I found a magic money tree? No. The only magic is building a good team and delivering good policies. We’re funded by our devolution deal, and from levering in £304 million of private sector investment so far, and counting.\nGrid Finder is one example. It’s a video gaming start-up company founded in late 2020. It helps online racing gamers to find other people to race with across Playstation, Xbox and PC. eSports is a rapidly growing industry, already worth billions. So it’s clear there was a market.\nThere’s nothing particularly magical about this – just sensible financial management. Grid Finder got the funds they needed to grow. We took a stake in their company in return.\nThe founders have just sold their company to US-based motorsports group, RAFA Racing Club for a 7-figure sum. A huge windfall for them. And for the North of Tyne too. Because that £100,000 comes back to our investment fund with a huge return.\nSo we’ve helped a North East start-up to grow and become successful and we got a return on our investment too. It’ll be invested again, and again, and again. Devolution has allowed us to be more innovative and provide better value for money to the taxpayer.\nInnovation is behind our financial success with skills training, too. The courses people need to skill-up for jobs – welding, catering, computer skills. Including green skills repairing electric vehicles and installing heat pumps.\nBefore adult education was devolved to us in August 2020, it was run from central Government. I felt it was organised in a scattergun way. The links between training providers and businesses were sparse at best. The links from Government to learners were even sparser. Neither learners nor employers seemed to have been asked what worked for them. Or why people might have dropped out.\nWhen it was devolved, we change the approach. We created a long-term framework to give training providers certainty. They’re often freelancers and small businesses, who now have long term, rolling contracts, so they can plan ahead. They can retain their good staff, because they can offer security of work.\nWe spoke to learners to find the real barriers to participation – a lack of wifi at home or a course clashing with the school run. We worked to overcome them. We spoke to employers, and got them involved in recruitment. Many of our courses now come with a guaranteed interview.\nWe’ve increased enrolments from 22,000 a year to 35,000 a year. On the same budget. It shows what can happen when a branch of government listens to its people.\nA 60% increase in value for money from a branch of government. In the old days, Sir Humphrey would have wanted to hush it up! Today it’s been rewarded by an expanded North East devolution deal – the best-funded deal in England. £6.1 billion for the North East, and I’m immensely proud of it.\nFor every £1 we invest in job creation, over £3 is returned to the Treasury in payroll taxes alone. The organisation I lead is a wealth-generating centre and has no net cost to the taxpayer locally or nationally.\nSo there’s no expensive layer of bureaucracy. No magic money tree. No metaphorical credit card. And no taxes. Just sound financial management. And more money for the people of the North East.",

The Key workers who kept our communities going throughout the pandemic, or the Russian oligarchs whose dirty money sloshes around the City of London? The health service workers who risked their lives to look after our loved ones, or the PM’s political cronies?\n“Sir Gavin Williamson.” If you don’t remember him, I’ll remind you. Sacked as Defence Secretary by Theresa May for leaking about Huwei and the UK’s 5G network. He denies it. Then sacked by Mr Johnson in September last year, as Education Secretary this time. Remember 2020 A-levels fiasco? The dodgy algorithm that marked down kids from disadvantaged areas? That was Mr Williamson, now Sir Gavin. It brings to mind Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\nThe PM didn’t even attempt to justify Sir Gavin’s knighthood. When he was Tory Chief Whip, he kept a tarantula in his office. More than one Conservative politician I’ve worked with has described him in terms that are unprintable in a respectable newspaper. So why knight him? Maybe it was services to Boris Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign. Either that or “Services to ineptitude.”\nThe Government now talks tough on Russia. But the cosying up to Kremlin-backed oligarchs has earned Britain’s capital city the nickname Londongrad. Transparency International estimates that Kremlin-connected dirty money has snaffled up £1.5 billion worth of luxury property. London property has provided fertile ground to bury suspicious wealth for years.\nIt’s not the only indulgence. Since 2008, 12,000 of the global super rich have purchased indefinite UK residency via the “golden visa” scheme. It’s described as a gold-plated invitation to launder money. A £2m “investment” buys residency within five years. £10m shortens it to two years. The “investment” can be buying property. And later selling it. Through shell companies. Compare and contrast with the Home Office’s abysmal visa performance for people fleeing the war in Ukraine.\nI’m not a fan of the honours system. At least not for leading politicians and wealthy businesspeople. These jobs come with enough prestige or money. Sometimes both. What about the charity volunteers? What about those who really keep the country running, but go unnoticed, and barely rewarded? Bus and train drivers, refuse workers, environmental health inspectors, social care workers, NHS staff, classroom assistants and teachers. All in the front line through the pandemic.\nAusterity meant a lost decade for pay. Council care workers in 2021 are down more than £1,600 a year in real terms compared to 2010. Their latest pay offer is 1.75%, while inflation surges to 8%. Nurses’ real wages are down more than £2,700 a year since 2010, but are getting just 3%. Yet billionaires got 54% richer through the pandemic.\nI’m sure you’re all too aware that household energy bills are rocketing by an average of £700 next month, and a further £1000 in the Autumn. But it’s not costing any more to pump it out of the ground. Prices are rising by 54%, but workers in those industries are not getting a 54% pay rise. Someone, somewhere is making an absolute fortune out of this. I’ll bet dimes to dollars it’s billionaires.\nThe Spring Statement is next week, 23rd March. We’ll see whose side the Chancellor is on. Will he watch millions of Britons slide into poverty? Choosing between heating and eating, trapping people in a cycle of debt?\nOr will he cancel the National Insurance rises – taxes on working people? Restore the £20 a week Universal Credit taken away from 6 million families last October, 66,000 in North of Tyne. Will he uprate benefits for families and people with disabilities in line with inflation? Do anything about the 2.5 million people so desperate they used food banks last year?\nI hope I’m wrong, but my guess Mr Sunak will say Britain can’t afford it. I disagree. A wealth tax on Britain’s richest 1% would raise £70bn to £130bn per year. Anyone with net assets over £3.4 million would pay 1% of their wealth, each year. So if your house, shares, savings, all add up to £4 million, you pay £6000 a year. Sounds fair to me.\nWhat Britain can’t afford is the rich getting richer while poverty crushes our people.\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 14 March 2022",

In a Mercedes? With a single refugee as your passenger? Staying in five-star hotels along the way? Sound expensive? Well it won’t cost as much as the Government’s new scheme to house refugees in vast camps 4,000 miles away from Britain.\nAnnounced with great fanfare as ‘the solution’ to global migration it’ll more than likely prove unworkable. Cruelty is expensive. As well as being immoral and unjust.\nThe Government has no idea how much it will cost. In a remarkable twist, Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s most senior civil servant, publicly wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel saying he couldn’t sign off the policy as value for money. Examples from around the world support his concern.\nAustralia spends about £2 million a year per refugee held on the island of Nauru in the Pacific. Even if the Rwandan version turns out to be a tenth of the price that’s still £200,000 per refugee per year.\nBoris Johnson and Priti Patel have made much of the £4.7 million a day hotel bill for asylum seekers. But that works out at about £130 per day per refugee or about £47,000 per year. Obviously accommodation isn’t the only cost but that looks like good value compared to the Rwanda plan.\nYet the money shouldn’t be our biggest concern. Morality should. Rwanda is already home to 150,000 refugees living in huge camps. The welfare of those that Ms Patel would ship off to East Africa is cause for concern. It has now emerged that the Rwandan authorities plan to evict survivors of the Rwandan genocide from their accommodation to make way for the arrivals from Britain.\nThe starting point is all wrong. If I was caught up in a civil war I would’ve tried to get out with my wife and children. I’m sure most people reading this would too. And if that’s our starting point then our asylum and immigration system would be very different.\nUkraine shows us how different it could be. Ukrainian refugees, at least in theory, get to be treated as human beings, deserving of help and support. The British public have responded with generosity – more than 100,000 people have registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. But only 12,000 Ukrainians have reached the UK so far, a fraction of the 240,000 welcomed by Germany or the 2.5 million taken in by Poland.\nYou could blame bureaucracy, as Priti Patel appeared to recently. Which is odd, since she’s in charge of that bureaucracy. But I think the real cause is a political culture that sees refugees as a problem to be dealt with rather than as people to be helped. If you spend years demonising your fellow human beings don’t be surprised when your institutions fail to respond quickly when you decide to help a few of them.\nMany of the intentions for Ukrainian refugees are good. The Homes for Ukraine scheme gives refugees the right to work, something refugees from other countries are often denied. Every refugee or asylum speaker I’ve met wants to work, and wants to contribute. If we were to lift the ban on employment for all asylum seekers we’d save money and give people back their dignity.\nDignity is the least anyone should expect. That’s why the North of Tyne Combined Authority has supported the Action Foundation, a local charity in Newcastle. We’re helping refugees and asylum seekers learn digital skills, get online, keep in touch with loved ones, and find work. It’s making a real difference to people’s lives, giving them a chance to flourish in their new country and put down roots here.\nThe country you came from shouldn’t determine whether you get to stay here or not. It’s a bit odd that if you come from Ukraine you could end up living with Grant Shapps but if you’re from Iran a tent in Rwanda is your more likely destination.\nOriginally printed in The Journal and Evening Chronicle 25 April 22",

I wanted the people of our region to have a say on this issue.\nThat’s why I was the first Metro Mayor to commission a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Change. I wanted a cross-section of the community to look at the issues in depth and tell me what they thought we should do. 30 hours of their time, 30 recommendations for the North of Tyne. It’s democracy in action.\nA Citizens’ Assembly is composed of a randomly-selected but representative group of people convened to consider a specific issue. People learn about the topic, including hearing evidence from expert witnesses, then weigh possible policy options and make actionable recommendations. It was overseen by a panel of experts from local authorities, trade unions, business, the voluntary sector, environmental groups, scientists, and academics.\nThe Assembly met over two months in early 2021 and produced 30 recommendations on housing, transport, energy, financing carbon reduction and raising awareness of the climate emergency. We then worked with our partner organisations to work out how to make them happen.\nWe’ve now agreed initial funding of £1 million to make an impact in three main areas:\nThe £2 million green skills programme includes delivering training to meet the skills demand in areas such as offshore wind (power generation & supply chain), retrofit and green construction. This complements the Just Transition work we are undertaking with the Energy Democracy Project and Transition Economics. As part of the research underlying this work a survey of those working in the fossil fuel sector was carried out over Summer 2022.\nThe community energy sector has constantly encountered barriers to progress. Work has been done which recommends ways of overcoming these barriers, along with a potential plan for supporting community energy in the region. We are now working with partners (North East LEP, LAs, community groups and regional stakeholders) to develop further support for community energy projects which is being led regionally by the North East and Yorkshire Energy Hub. Several organisations in Northumberland have already benefitted from Rural Community Energy Funding.\nRetrofitting is a necessary first step to reducing energy use. We have now audited the region’s housing stock to provide the evidence base for a large-scale retrofitting programme. I’m lobbying Government get that funding.\nAnd this isn’t the last of it.

The resignation of a Cressida Dick. The interminable saga of when, exactly, Boris Johnson’s MPs will topple him. Liz Truss’s flood of taxpayer-funded photo-ops.\nAll political stories, but none comes close to relevance of the cost of living crisis. The cost of your groceries, fuel bills, rent and rapidly dwindling savings has an immediacy beyond the news bulletins. The drag of poverty is as urgent as the climate crisis, and it causes long-term scarring to our whole society. They are aspects of the same problem – an economic system that thinks making a profit is divorced from the social and environmental impact it causes. In the end, someone has to pay. And the burden never seems to fall on the mega-rich.\nThe Government, unsurprisingly, isn’t joined-up in this. To give just one example, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has a scheme encouraging people to save energy. Called the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive, it encourages households to install a heat-pump. This month, the BEIS select committee published a report called Decarbonising Heat in Homes. It calls on the Government to help householders financially.\nMost of us followed the lockdown rules – with some famous party exceptions – so work like installing heat pumps was delayed. Now time is almost running out to get the work completed and become eligible for the payments – but BEIS hasn’t extended the deadline. So people are paying out shedloads of money, with the best of green intentions, while the Government sits and watches them. Undermining its own policy. It’s like living in a Kafka novel.\nGovernment could take action. But so far it hasn’t. What’s worse is this kind of incoherence is so commonplace, no one is surprised.\nA few years ago, North East based social housing organisation Gentoo published a report about ‘Boilers On Prescription’. The idea was that warmer homes lead to other positive effects. They launched a pilot scheme to gather evidence. They worked with local GPs to ‘prescribe’ a housing retrofit for patients with health conditions associated with cold damp homes. They fitted double glazing, insulated walls and lofts, and installed energy efficient heating systems. The results were astonishing.\nCustomer after customer reported a positive effect on their health, and their family’s health. Retrofitting produced the energy and financial savings that Gentoo was hoping for – a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, and a £125 average reduction in annual fuel bills. Homes were warmer, despite using less fuel.\nBut crucially, it reduced emergency hospital admissions. It reduced emergency re-admissions. It reduced visits to GP surgeries, and GP call-outs. It improved patients’ self-care and sustainability. It improved the quality of life for people with long-term health conditions. It increased the life expectancy of the local population. And since an emergency hospital admission costs £2,500, it saved the NHS a fortune.\nWin. Win. Win. Win. Win. Win. Win.\nI raise these questions with ministers and government officials. The need to join up policy. How tackling poor housing improves health, reduces carbon emissions, saves the NHS money, and creates jobs all at the same time. I even wrote a detailed policy paper, showing where the money can come from (Google Jamie Driscoll, Regional Wealth Generation). But it’s like trying to turn a supertanker.\nAt the North of Tyne Combined Authority, happily, we’ve got a different approach.\nOur Green New Deal Fund provides financial backing to projects that deliver real carbon savings, and create new, well-paid jobs. And it develops skills in our region’s low-carbon industries.\nWe’re providing between £200,000 to £1 million per project to support all kinds of initiatives. Community energy schemes. Electric Vehicle charging solutions. Building retrofits. Small scale renewable energy generation. Natural capital. Low-carbon heating systems.\nOver the next four years our Green New Deal Fund will invest at least £18 million in low carbon projects in the North of Tyne. We’re offering low-cost loans and patient equity, which recipients can repay from their energy savings or business growth. So the fund is recyclable, meaning the money can be spent again. And again.\nJoined-up projects like this seem blindingly obvious to me. It’s a pity the Government doesn’t see things this way. But we see it very clearly.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_build-back-fairer/content_236.html": "Build Back Fairer\nFebruary 28, 2021\n“Build Back Better” has become the mantra. Good as far as it goes, but unless we build back fairer we’re back to the status quo. High levels of economic inequality and deprivation are damaging to health and wellbeing. The core objective must be providing good jobs.\nKen Loach’s Sorry We Missed You was a superb swipe at zero-hours Britain. The main character, Ricky, is persuaded by his mate to take on what looks like a nice little earner, van driving for a delivery company. Except it turns out it’s not a job, but bogus self-employment. He gets no holiday, no pension, no sick pay, and yet doesn’t have the freedom of how to work, or even let his daughter ride in the cab with him.\nNo such thing as rest breaks, he has to carry an empty plastic bottle with him for when nature calls. His life rapidly descends in to one of unrelenting stress and financial insecurity which has a toxic impact on his wellbeing and his family life. It’s also set in Newcastle, and worth a watch if you haven’t seen it.\nSelf-employment can be great. It’s hard work, and can be risky. But you get to be the boss, and you get to keep the profits. I’m right behind small businesses and entrepreneurialism. But the gig-economy is not self-employment. It’s serfdom. Gig-economy workers don’t get to keep the profits.\nIf you’re on low pay, you have no choice but to work long hours. Nationally, 56% of people in poverty are in a working family. It was 39% twenty years ago. In the North East, 22% of our workers are paid less than the Real Living Wage (£9.50/hr), the pay rate you need to pay your bills without falling into debt or hunger.\nOver the past ten years we’ve seen an explosion in the gig economy. Pre-Covid, 1 in 6 UK workers were in insecure employment. There is a direct correlation between insecure work, workplace bullying and health and safety violations. Of course, the rest of us have to pick up the bill for the social consequences of that.\nPoor employment contracts are bad for your health. The Good Work Monitor, from the Institute for Future Work, published evidence that lower paid and lower status jobs have increased illness, mortality, and “diseases of despair” – suicide and substance abuse. Our social care workers are particularly vulnerable. Poverty wages and no sick pay means they’re too poor to stay safe.\nThere is an alternative. Last week I spoke at an event organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Future of Work. Alongside my Metro Mayor colleague Andy Burnham and Professor Sir Michael Marmot, the public health guru.\nI highlighted our work in the North of Tyne on our Good Work Pledge. It underpins all of the 3,200 jobs we’re on target to create. It was great to get the thumbs up for the Good Work Pledge from Sir Michael. We’re meeting with his team to explore what more we can do to tackle the health inequality in our region\nCriticising bad business practices is not anti-business any more than criticising dangerous drivers is anti-driving. Calling for better employment practices is pro-business. Our Good Work Pledge was developed with the North East Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the British Confederation of Industry. They hate bad employment – and want to see good employers rewarded. If you’re an employer, and you look after your staff, please get in touch if you want to sign up. There’s a “low-admin” route for small businesses. It’s all on the North of Tyne website.\nIn the crusade to provide good work, stamping out insecure employment is crucial. A word of thanks therefore to the Uber drivers. Their years-long fight to be classed as workers and not self-employed “partners” was finally ruled on by the supreme court a fortnight ago. The court’s unanimous decision was that Uber drivers were “workers” entitled to basic rights including the minimum wage and statutory holidays.\nThis landmark ruling is another step towards making the exploitation of gig economy workers like Ricky a thing of the past.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 1.3.21",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-transport-system-do-we-want-how-do-we-pay-for-it/content_231.html": "What Transport System do we Want? How do we Pay for it?\nJune 6, 2021\nWhen we talk about transport there are two questions. First, what transport system do we want? And second, how are we going to pay for it? It’s the second one that causes all the problems.\nTransport is a fundamental part of everything we do. It’s a mistake to let the market dictate its direction. It needs long-term planning.\nAt the moment, funding is allocated by short-term competitive competitions. Imagine you’ve got to host a meal. But you don’t know your budget, or when you have to serve the meal, or what type of food, or even if anyone is coming until an hour beforehand. You’d have no time to plan, and little opportunity to innovate. That’s why so many transport schemes end up being variations on the last thing that happened, made from left-over ingredients.\nThe planet is on the precipice of a climate catastrophe. In the Budget, the Chancellor announced £1 billion for green transport. Then triumphantly announced “£27billion for tarmac”. There’s a mismatch there and I don’t think I’m the only one who sees it. You can’t level up with concrete.\nWe’ve learned to assume that the way to transport an 80Kg human is with a 1500Kg vehicle. Then leave that 1500Kg vehicle lying around all day before driving it home. I’m an engineer, the thermodynamics of that just don’t work. There’s a place for cars, but they’re not as essential as we think.\nIt’s not so long ago we all assumed that buying videos and DVDs was the best way to watch films at home. These days, streaming is more convenient and often cheaper. Transport should be about moving people, not cars. We should treat Mobility as a Service – known as MaaS. But what would that look like?\nWe could access all our transport needs through one smartphone app. The technology already exists to give us options for every journey – Metro, taxi, bus, bike, walk, and how to integrate them. It can give us real-time location data, buy tickets and reserve us a seat, or an eBike if we need it when we get off the other end. And it’s all integrated so it will calculate the cheapest ticket all the way to your destination. It can even book you a car in a car club and reserve a parking space if you need to drive. When it’s as easy as walking out the front door and turning the key in your car, people will migrate away from cars.\nIf we invest in bus priority gates, and drivers don’t need to spend time taking fares, buses can be faster than cars – once you take parking into account. Mix in secure cycle parking, and invest in showers in workplaces and public buildings, and cycling will increase. Get ourselves fit and trim, and head off a health crisis that’s coming our way.\nSo how do we pay for it?\nThe truth is, we already are. We’re just in denial about it. It costs £4,600 per year to own and run a car. Most of the time it’s parked up somewhere rusting. I’ve just sold my car, and am joining a car club.\nObesity related illness will cost the UK £49billion a year in by 2050. Road maintenance is so expensive because we’re taking 1500kg of steel with us every time we go somewhere. We need to re-allocate the way we spend our national resources.\nWe must fund revenue as well as capital. We’re going to get the first of our new Metro Trains in 2023, but still don’t know if we’ll have the revenue to run them when the current funding runs out.\nIn the North we’ve been underfunded by £66billion. We will only level up when our fate is in our hands. With long-term funding so we can plan. I’ve written about fiscal devolution before – the power to generate wealth here, in the North East.\nWithout this rethink, we’ll be trapped in transport Groundhog Day. Asking why some people are stuck in traffic jams, others are stuck in transport poverty, while type 2 diabetes runs rampant, and our planet is burning around us.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 07 June 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant/content_127.html": "Sunlight is the best disinfectant\nJanuary 14, 2024\nSunlight is the best disinfectant.\nLast week I said that honesty is more than the absence of lies. Sadly I was proved right almost immediately.\nOn the Post Office Horizon scandal it turns out not just Conservatives and Lib Dem Ed Davey have questions to answer, but so too Tony Blair. He was warned in 1998. Memos show their concern was around “political fallout, no matter how carefully we try to handle it”. I think the truth should have come first.\nCloser to home, a Labour PCC and Labour Councillor tried to grab some headlines by dishonestly blaming other people.\nWhat did they say? That “the Government froze Durham out of a key transport fund” that will cause “two-tier devolution.” There’s more, it was reported in the Northern Echo. I’ve put a link to the article below. In short, Carl Marshall did his level best to stop Durham joining the deal, which led to other Labour Leaders freezing Durham out of some of the transport money. To blame it on the Government is just untrue.\nThese were not misguided comments and garbled words. They must have sent out a press release.\nIn my 2019 manifesto I promised I’d work to get transport devolution or the full North East. I worked with Treasury, Transport, Local Government, Education, and Business Ministers to make it happen. That deal is now worth £6.1 billion, and I’m immensely proud of it. The North East needs investment. You can read the history of it in the links, below.\nDurham was originally part of the negotiations from 2020. They then chose to negotiate their own deal in 2021. Government said they would not get transport money if they did that, so in mid-2022 I proposed they rejoin the rest of the region.\nIn August 2022 Durham Labour leader Carl Marshall launched a campaign to stop Durham joining the North East deal. He approached all the Labour council leaders asking them to block Durham. He campaigned against it on social media.\nI persuaded Government Ministers to leave the door open for Durham. But after Carl Marshall’s campaign, I had a hell of a battle with the Labour council leaders to persuade them to agree to let Durham back in. In the end it was agreed that Durham could join, but the Labour leaders insisted that Durham should not get part of the first £475 million of transport money. After that, Durham gets its full share of all future transport investment – including all the new money coming from the cancellation of HS2. This only applies to capital investment, by the way. Durham still gets its share of bus revenue support and pothole money from day 1. And a full share of the next £1.85 billion of devolved money.\nKim McGuinness claimed that Government should confirm Durham will get its share of the next round of transport money. That too is a dishonest call – it’s been confirmed in writing for over a year!\nParagraph 110 of the North East Devolution Deal states unequivocally that spending decisions are made by the new Mayor in conjunction with the council leaders, not by central Government. It’s there, online, in black and white, and in the devolution deal I signed with Ministers and Council Leaders.\nBut here’s the question: what motivates two senior local politicians to put out a press release based on claims they know are untrue? Do they think it is okay to mislead people? Do they think the truth is irrelevant in politics? What other dishonesty can we expect in order to further their careers?\nMore worryingly, how would they ever be able to win the trust needed to work cross-party with different governments and other leaders? I’d say it shows they are unfit to hold office. As Amanda Hopgood, Durham’s coalition leader says, it’s “more than worrying that she [Ms McGuinness] is not aware of the terms of the deal.”\nI hope local democracy journalists press them for answers.\nThis is not peculiarly a Labour Party problem. Dishonesty is spread around politics. As are high standards of integrity. I know that many in the Labour Party are appalled by the untruths from Ms McGuinness and Mr Marshall.\nAs I said last week, we need politicians to subject themselves to scrutiny, not hide behind spin and lies. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.\nOn Wednesday just gone I was in Ponteland. A full hall of local people asked me questions from transport to education, and even to tell a joke!\nI’m in Berwick on Monday (15th Jan), link to future meetings below. I’ll always listen to your questions, and give you a full and honest answer.\nLink to my Bylines article calling them out HERE\nThe Northern Echo article of their claims HERE\nThe devolution negotiation article HERE\nFind out about my upcoming meetings HERE",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_will-closing-ticket-offices-help-improve-rail-services/content_201.html": "Will closing ticket offices help improve rail services?\nJuly 16, 2023\nA couple of weeks back I was standing by the departures boards at Newcastle Central Station. A gentleman asked me what platform a particular train was coming into. I was about to point him to the departures board, when I noticed he held a folded white stick. So I read the board for him, and we found a member of staff to help him to his platform. Just then the Guardian journalist I was waiting for arrived with comic timing – I had to assure him it was not a set up!\nLast week it was announced that almost every ticket office will close. My first thought was for the workers who’ll lose their jobs. My second thought was for that visually impaired gentleman at the station – let’s call him Joe.\nWithout a staff presence, how will Joe navigate our public transport system? Who will help him book tickets? Or get information on train times and platform numbers? If those staff disappear, would he even feel confident using the rail network anymore?\nHow can Joe make his voice heard on these proposed changes? Well, he can register his opposition with the official 21-day public consultation process. But here’s the real kicker – the train companies are not required to put the consultation documents into an accessible format. If I’m Joe, I’m starting to feel like a third-class citizen at this point. If I’m Joe, I’m angry.\nJoe’s freedom to travel will be reduced – possibly removed. He’s not alone. Fewer staff means less support for anyone who’s vulnerable. Government and train operators are saying if you’re disabled, a young person, or a woman travelling late at night, good luck, but you’re on your own.\nAnd as for changing your ticket or working out what time Super Off Peak starts, well, if you struggle with technology, you’ve got no chance. I’ve got a degree in engineering and it baffles me!\nNorthern Trains intend to scrap 53% of ticket office roles over the next two years. They’ve sent out notices of redundancy. Of their 149 ticket offices, they want to close 131. LNER are planning to effectively close facilities at stations – without station staff, waiting rooms, toilets and baby change facilities will eventually close.\nI’ll be at the Maltings in Berwick at 5pm on Friday, talking about this very subject.\nMaybe you don’t use the trains. But this is part of a pattern of behaviour. We’ve been deregulating and selling off public services and infrastructure for 40 years. We were told the profit motive would improve efficiency. Do you believe it has panned out like that?\nMaybe ask the small business owner sending a parcel to the Highlands. Ask the commuter staring at display screens of cancelled trains. Ask the landlady of your local pub if she can afford to keep the lights on and the doors open next month. Ask the child swimming in raw sewage at one of our beaches.\nIf you own a restaurant or a joinery firm, I want your business to be profitable. We’ve helped thousands of businesses grow. They succeed by providing better products and services, and investing for the long term.\nBut privatisation of our utilities, services and NHS is driven by short-term quarterly results. £billions have been taken out and transferred to the mega wealthy, typically non-UK taxpayers, while services crumble and investment shrinks.\nDedicated ticket office staff are seen as a line on a spreadsheet, a potential ‘efficiency saving’, an equation to be resolved. And as for people like Joe, well, they’re just collateral damage.\nEnough is enough. Polling shows two thirds of British people, including Tory voters, support public ownership of our key utilities and services. I agree.\nI don’t want us to be at the mercy of any government. In February 2020 I went to the Treasury and successfully argued for £billions in transport funding as part of our expanded North East Devolution Deal. I want us to control our own destiny and build a Total Transport Network across the region – with integrated ticketing, reliable services, cheap fares, guards on trains, publicly controlled buses and free travel for all under-18s.\nIt’s time to reverse privatisation.

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_i-not-naughty-you-naughty/content_172.html": "I not naughty, you naughty!\nOctober 8, 2023\n“Daddy, my crayon has broke,” said Leon.\nI’m going back to when my boys were toddlers. I’d wound back my business and kept a few clients, to look after the kids while my wife continued her NHS medical career.\n“Oh dear, how’d you do that, son?”\n“It broke on the wall.”\nAlarm bells ringing in my head, I dashed downstairs to find Nelson in full Neolithic cave-art mode. Navy blue Crayloa on magnolia emulsion, Celtic swirls decorating the wall on the stairs.\nCrayons were confiscated, boys calmly but sternly told of the seriousness of their actions. A courtroom drama ensued in which Nelson introduced the plot twist, “No I not naughty. You naughty!”\nMr Sunak’s speech at Conservative Party conference reminded me of this. Someone has made a terrible mess of Britain, he said! We need change, he said! Vote for me, and I’ll fix it, he said! All the eloquence of my toddler son: “I not naughty, you naughty!”\nI’d hoped we’d seen the end of toddler politics when Mr Johnson resigned. Yet toddler politics is proliferating. Sir Keir is demonising the Conservatives’ actions – with some justification – but then adopts their polices! Taxing work higher than unearned income. Punishing kids with more than one sibling, denying them a welfare safety net. Increasing privatisation in the NHS. “No I not naughty. You naughty!”\nIt gets sillier. Presumably dismayed at his failure to outflank Sir Keir to the right, Mr Sunak has started making up nursery yard bogeymen. I will protect you from having seven recycling bins! I will protect you from taxes on meat! And I promise I will never, ever, make you share your car with strangers! I’m not exaggerating. He literally said this.\nHow do you parody that? If you re-elect me, as Independent Mayor for the expanded North East devolved authority, I hereby promise I will not make you hold a chicken in the air, stick a deckchair up your nose, buy a jumbo jet or bury all your clothes.\nYou may have missed it, but Sir Keir Starmer made a speech last week in which he praised Margaret Thatcher’s approach to law and order. Yes, actually, literally. I wonder what the Hillsborough families think of that. Crime, rioting and drug addiction rocketed under Mrs Thatcher.\nIt’s a slash and burn approach to truth. No wonder only 11% of people trust Mr Sunak to keep his promises, according to a recent Ipsos Mori poll. Mind you, only 21% of people think Sir Keir will.\nAs someone who’s striven to build trust by working cross party, putting delivery ahead of political game playing, I’m saddened that there’s so little trust in Westminster politics.\nPart of it is the expenses scandal. And ongoing sleaze. The common complaint, “they’re all in it for themselves.” Dinner with Rishi Sunak in Manchester would have cost you £3300. Dinner with Keir Starmer in Liverpool is £2520. It’s naked cash for access.\nOutside of Westminster, voters are already choosing another option. Independents, Greens, and a slew of local community parties are winning up and down the country, many of them ex-Labour. Don’t get me wrong – there are some good people still in the mainstream parties, too. But Westminster politics is undermining them.\nSome of my campaign volunteers were leafleting in Durham this weekend. One of them messaged me, “My most used line of the day was ‘I’m not Labour or Tory’ to which they replied, ‘Ok I’ll talk to you then.’”\n“I’ve donated to your campaign,” an older gentleman told me in the street just this weekend. “I want the Tories out, but I’m not that hopeful Labour will change anything.” I get stopped in the cinema, at a café, on the Metro, at the shops. Every time I go out people tell me the same thing.\nOver 100 local people turned up to hear me speak in Wallsend last Thursday. It’s been the same in Morpeth, North Shields, Hexham and Newton Aycliffe.

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-would-count-as-the-lionesses-legacy/content_311.html": "What Would Count as the Lionesses’ Legacy?\nAugust 7, 2022\n“Sweet Caroline, bah, bah, bah.” That song gets sung particularly loudly in our house because my wife’s called Caroline. The boys and I were belting it out last weekend, after Ella Toone’s stunning chip. And with a storybook ending, Chloe Kelley’s extra-time winner had us all bouncing. I hope the next door neighbours were watching, or they’d have wondered what was going on!\nThe sheer joy sparking off the Lionesses was contagious. When Chloe Kelly’s excitement burst through and she ran off with the mic in the middle of being interviewed. Gate-crashing the press conference, dancing on the table. The team spirit was exceptional. Sarina Wiegman’s management style is a study in calm, intelligent leadership. The Lionesses made history and are determined their success leaves a legacy.\nBut what would count as a legacy? I was told last week that after Andy Murray won Wimbledon, grassroots participation in tennis declined. I didn’t ask for the evidence, but the person who told me is on the Women’s Super League board. The concern is that success on the pitch doesn’t automatically translate into more vibrant participation.\nWomen’s football is every bit as engaging as the men’s game. I don’t need to be told that women are just as physical, tough and skilled as men. I was a martial arts instructor for over 20 years and had the pleasure of teaching some of the most capable women I’ve ever met. We had just as many women black belts at the club as we did men black belts, and they trained and fought together – there was no gender segregation.\nLook at the cash difference between the men’s game and the women’s. England Captain Leah Williamson earns in a year what England Captain Harry Kane earns in a week. And Harry Kane isn’t the highest paid. That’s Cristiano Ronaldo, reportedly on £400k a week. The average wage of a Women’s Super League player is £47,000. A year.\nEven when a sport has more top level funding, it can just mean more agents, more hoovering up talent for elite squads, rather than more participation or more people playing for fun. You don’t have to be a world class athlete like the Lionesses to feel the benefit, and you don’t have to lift a European trophy to feel great after playing sport. If physical activity were a drug, we’d call it a miracle cure, due to the vast range of physical and mental illnesses it can prevent and help treat.\nThe NHS and Public Health England recommend 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise for adults. School age kids should average a minimum of 60 minutes a day. I looked up the figures – only 43.6% of secondary school kids manage that; 42.3% of boys, and 45.5% of girls. Fully 33.6% don’t manage 30 minutes a day. You could get that from just walking or cycling to school.\nI can’t help thinking our transport system contributes to this. My boys are 14 and 16 now, but like all parents, I worried about them cycling or crossing busy roads when they were younger. With bus prices so expensive, no wonder parents are tempted to drive their kids door to door.\nAnd austerity has salami-sliced budgets so thin that public recreation facilities are threadbare. Youth clubs have all but disappeared, compared to my childhood. It took a fantastic community campaign from the Friends of Elswick Pool, working with Newcastle Council, just to get a swimming pool available for thousands of kids in Newcastle’s West End.\nI’d like to see the North East lead the way with mass participatory sport. We have the world’s biggest and most famous half-marathon – and that’s not just regional pride speaking, the figures prove it. There are Park Runs, and grassroots sports clubs, and gyms across the region. But I’d like to see a programme that’s designed for everyone to take part in, whatever their age, ability or body shape. I’d like to see us come together, in a Great North Festival of Sport, that’s all about intergenerational participation and fun. Maybe we could really bring our region together by closing it with a mass singing of Sweet Caroline.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 8 August 22",

Decide for yourself if my plans make sense.\nI’ve been North of Tyne Metro Mayor since 2019. In my manifesto I promised to unite the North and South of our region so we can control our own transport system. I’ve fulfilled that promise and landed £4.3 billion of investment for us – it’s about time the North East got our fair share.\nTickets are free, but please book in advance to guarantee a place. Doors open 6.30pm. Event starts 7.00pm. You can get a free ticket at Eventbrite HERE\nThis is a public meeting. We don’t have control over any attendee taking photographs or video and posting them on social media. We will also be taking some photographs and video at the meeting. Whilst we can try to accommodate you outside of the main audience, we cannot guarantee you won’t be visible on a social media post.\nNo public money is being spent on this event. All funds come from crowdfunding. 6,100 people have donated to my grassroots campaign. Public meetings are an important part of my campaign to become the North East Mayor. I’m aiming to visit every main population centre in the North East Mayoral region and leaflet around each one. Every penny of our campaign funds will be essential to do that. So if you’ve already donated, thank you. And if you could please spread the word to anyone who can chip in a spare tenner, that would be great! We’re so close to our target, it would be great to get there!",

Or at least since 1971 when L’Oréal first came up with the slogan.\nBut are they? Medieval monarchs asserted the ‘divine right of kings.’ That their political power derived from God so they were not accountable to any earthly authority such as a parliament. A handy get-out-of-jail free card, but one that didn’t work out so well for the first King Charles.\n‘Divine right’ looks transparently self-serving by today’s standards. But is everything we accept now really grounded in solid intellectual foundations?\nWe’re constantly told “there’s no money” – for free school meals, insulating homes or key worker pay. But billionaires have plenty. And there are 177 of them in the UK, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\nWhen over 7 million households have been pushed into fuel poverty, it’s a contrast worth examining. The fuel price crisis is not a law of nature. Wholesalers are charging more for the gas from the North Sea. For the electricity from our wind turbines. The wind hasn’t put its costs up. The workers producing this energy haven’t got a 300% pay rise. Fuel poverty is an exact mirror of billionaire profiteering.\nSo how do we change it?\nLast week my fellow Metro Mayors and I met with Labour front benchers to input into the next manifesto, via Labour’s National Policy Forum. It was like Shadow Cabinet speed-dating. And some were definitely worth keeping in touch with.\nLou Haigh, shadowing transport, was on board with our plans for re-opening the Leamside Line – vital for public transport in our region.\nJonny Reynolds, shadowing business, was sold on the case for expanding employee ownership of companies – one way of shifting the balance of power in favour of those who actually do the work.\nYvette Cooper, shadowing the Home Office, agreed that we need to help people early – by supporting kids who are excluded from school, and stopping them drifting into crime.\nEd Miliband, leading Labour’s net zero agenda, agreed that we need to enforce the ‘local content’ rules – so wind farms in British waters are 60% built here. That’ll create thousands of jobs.\nA Labour Government looks increasingly likely. But I don’t want to wait. And I don’t want to depend on going to Westminster like Oliver Twist.\nWe won’t tackle wealth inequality by raising taxes on working people. We have to be smarter than that.\nWe’ll do a better job if we ditch the L’Oréal doctrine and go for universal wealth generation. Everyone must have the opportunity – and support – to thrive. Wherever they live and whatever their family background. We need tools to generate wealth here, and keep it here.\nTools like Earnback.\nIn my time as Mayor, every £1 we’ve invested in job creation returns over £3 to the Treasury in payroll taxes alone.\nImagine if government let us keep the first year and a half of payroll taxes and benefit savings on those new jobs. We’d reinvest that money, creating more jobs and a stronger economy, in a virtuous circle.\nTools like Invest to Save.\nWhere Mayors can pitch to government that if we achieve a social good, we get the money saved from health, criminal justice or the environment.\nWe agree on how our work will be marked by government and agree a rate of return.\nPeople in warm homes don’t get ill as much. Studies have shown that every £1 invested in home insulation saves the NHS 42p. Add in the long-term energy savings, and the jobs created, then retrofitting homes looks a lot more affordable. We could start by working with private landlords.\nLet’s remove the Whitehall shackles that stop us fixing problems here.\nWe wouldn’t allow anyone to use a sound system that pumped out a billion decibels. It would damage everyone’s hearing for miles around. And it would be millions times more than what’s needed for a good time. So it is with billionaires – extreme wealth concentration harms other people.\nLike the ‘divine right of kings,’ the ‘L’Oréal doctrine’ belongs in the dustbin of history. Nobody should be above the law. And no one should be worth a billion pounds.",

On servicing. New tyres. MOT. Road tax. Insurance. Hospital parking charges. Depreciation.\nAnd 96% of today’s cars are still powered by fossil fuels. It is literally costing us the Earth.\nSo what’s the alternative?\nHenry Ford said, “If I’d asked people what they wanted, they’d have said ‘Faster horses’”.\nImagine a system based around people instead of vehicles. Where the question changes from, “is there enough parking?” To, “how do we make the bus stop more comfortable?”\nWe’ve negotiated a new devolution deal for the North East. I promised we would in my 2019 manifesto. And we’ve delivered. Bus franchising gives us the power to take control of our transport system.\nA single intelligent network covering the North East from Berwick to Barnard Castle. Where every bus has a transponder so passengers can see its location on an app, in real time, and be sure it’s coming. Where we use that data for continuous improvement.\nWhere every traffic hotspot has a bus gate – so when the bus approaches, the traffic lights change and give it priority while the cars wait.\nBuses won’t need to wait while the driver sells tickets, so they’ll be faster. People will feel safe, whether 8 or 80, because we’ll have guards on the trains. You’ll be able to read your book on the way to work. And the smart navigation system will integrate walking and cycling, with safer crossings and more dedicated active travel routes.\nFree wifi on every bus and every train and an integrated Google Maps style navigation system with real-time data. Where you can reserve a bike locker in town so you no longer worry about theft.\nWhere your account is keyed to your smartphone or smartcard and automatically charges you the lowest fare. So once you’ve hit a price cap, you get unlimited travel for free. Whether you switch between bus, Metro, National Rail, or e-scooter. And yes, you’ll still be able to buy a day ticket, with cash, so visitors from outside the region can use it.\nOur villages and hamlets will have transport on demand. Half bus, half taxi, where you book your journey in advance, the computer calculates the best route, and tells you when your bus will arrive. No more standing on a cold wet roadside, hoping you haven’t missed it. And you’ll still pay the same flat fee as people living in the cities.\nIf you want to get away for the weekend, or go to an away game, we’ll have expanded car clubs where you can hire a car.\nAnd the entire fleet powered by renewable electricity or green hydrogen.\nThis is not a zero-sum game, by the way. Better public transport means a better deal for motorists. Who likes cruising around looking for a parking space? Who likes sitting in traffic jams?\nFewer cars on the road means a plumber with a van full of tools or a doctor on call can spend their time doing their job instead of sitting in traffic. It boosts productivity.\nWe have 861,000 cars in the North East. 186,000 households own two cars. If you can get to work or college easily; if you can your shopping delivered, if you can go on a night out without needing a car – why would you own two?\nThomas Edison famously said, “We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.”\nI’m saying, we will make public transport so good that people will choose to leave their cars behind. A transport system where we’re proud of the fact that we pay our key workers a good wage and give them the status they deserve.\nThe job of your politicians is to say “We will put a man on the Moon by the end of this decade.” Well I’m saying if I’m elected for a second term, this time as North East Mayor, we will build that total transport network.\nA zero carbon, zero poverty transport system for future generations to inherit with pride.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_achievements_fighting-for-the-climate/content_24.html": "Green New Deal\n- Green Industrial Revolution\nIf you’re reading this then I probably don’t need to explain why climate change is one of the more important threats to humanity we face.\nBut climate breakdown is not the only emergency we face. I no longer own a car, I cycle to meetings, I have solar panels on my roof. But that’s not an option for everyone. If you live in suburb with no metro and expensive buses, and have to drop your kids off at school before heading to the first of your two minimum-wage, part-time jobs, you won’t be thinking about buying a Tesla – you’ll be too busy putting food on the table. The drag of poverty is as urgent as the climate crisis, and it causes long-term scarring to our whole society. And they are two sides of the same coin. Covid, and the climate crisis, has caused us to rethink how our economy works. It can no longer be about rising share prices or housing bubbles. It’s about a secure future for everyone. That’s how we take people with us. We build a Zero-Carbon, Zero-Poverty North East.\nIf you add up what we have committed on just 2 of our projects; the green new deal and offshore, you get over £50m of direct investment in climate related growth. This is not just talk, we are putting our money where our mouth is.\nNTCA have agreed a strategic approach with an emphasis on:\nWe are not doing this alone, we are using the convening power of a Mayoral Combined Authority to get local, regional and national stakeholders working together on this agenda of supporting decarbonisation whilst also supporting the economic opportunity and creation of good green jobs. We are working closely with our Local Authorities; North East Energy Catalyst; regional universities; Offshore and Renewable Energy Catapult; North East Environment Coalition etc.\nThis is the power of devolution. We can bring organisations together and breakdown the siloed way of working.\nWe’re investing £25 million in our offshore wind and subsea sector. Partnering with the Catapult. Improving infrastructure, like stronger cranes to handle bigger turbines, and funding high-tech solutions like digital technology with sensors, cable arrays, and digital twins to reduce the costs of installing offshore wind.\nInvestment to bring the old Swan Hunters Yard back into productive use. This is an iconic site on the River Tyne. It’ll be a momentous day when this site is up and running again.\nToo many of our brightest and best have innovative ideas, but can’t raise the capital to get them off the ground. Our Green New Deal directly funds investments into solar capacity and energy efficiency. This £18 million fund will create hundreds of jobs, and save our partners, public and private, on energy bills and reduce fuel poverty. It is also aligned with our Good Work Pledge.\nWe’re also working with the Energy Democracy Project and Transition Economics to explore how we can practically support a just and inclusive transition to greener jobs. It is a research project talking to people in a wide variety of industries across the North of Tyne area. This is about capturing the attitudes and views of workers on the ground. Some will be in high carbon industries like plumbers who fit gas boilers. They will be asked how they see their future and what training opportunities they are aware of. But views will also be captured from workers in a wide variety of other industries which could include mechanics, farm workers, hoteliers. Some will be unionised, some won’t be. This will offer a fascinating insight into the reality of delivering a just transition.\nAnd North of Tyne Combined Authority is leading by example. The transition to net zero is embedded into our Corporate Plan.\nOur Environmental Policy commits us to embed climate change into our decision making processes and work towards becoming a net zero organisation – our carbon footprint report explains that we have invested in local woodland creation that will, over time, produce verifiable emissions reductions locally while we continue to work to reduce our corporate emissions.\nOur Strategic Skills Plan demonstrates that green growth and energy are priority growth sectors for North of Tyne, emphasising the opportunities around developing green skills and a just and inclusive transition to a green economy.\nOur Zero Carbon, Zero Poverty Crowdfund commits us to work with communities to tackle the climate emergency and food poverty. This funds projects brought forward by all sorts of communities and could be anything from a community garden, to supporting the reduction of food waste, or a community food club.\nI want to make sure kids and young people are getting a hands-on climate education so set up the Mayor’s School Climate Challenge.\nAnd we have the ongoing work responding to the Citizens’ Assembly’s recommendations around energy, housing and skills.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_achievements_good-work/content_46.html": "Working with Business\n- Community Wealth Building\nGovernment set us a 30 year target of 10,000 jobs. The reality is 4,800 new jobs in just four years and another 2,700 jobs saved by our investment through the pandemic. The jobs we are creating are all permanent, well-paid with good career prospects and are all directly attributable to our funding. Every £1 we spend returns over £3 to Treasury in payroll taxes alone.\nBut good work is about so much more than job creation. The North of Tyne’s employment charter, the Good Work Pledge, was launched November 2021. It is the result of collaboration and co-design with the business community and trade unions. It is backed by the CBI and the North East Chamber of Commerce. It underpins all of the thousands of jobs we are creating. It boosts companies’ productivity and boosts workers’ quality of life.\nTo date, 72 local employers, from both the private and public sectors, have become accredited. Together, these organisations cover over 50,000 employees. I want to see good work becoming the norm through supporting initiatives such as the development of employee-owned cooperatives and community interest companies in sectors which have often been characterised by exploitative employment practices.\nOne such is the supply teacher private agency sector. Since early 2020 we have been working with the teaching unions to develop a social enterprise alternative which will provide better pay for supply teachers and be of benefit to schools. The co-op has now been registered and a provisional launch date is early in 2023.\nAs well as creating good jobs we’ve also started measuring our performance against a Wellbeing Framework developed with the help of the Carnegie UK Trust.

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_has-devolution-been-a-documentary-or-a-political-thriller/content_137.html": "Has devolution been a documentary or a political thriller?\nJune 18, 2023\nThere’s a scene in The West Wing where Democrat President Bartlett is deadlocked with the Republican House. The Budget renewal has passed its deadline. Government is shutdown. President Bartlett walks up to the Capitol to speak to the Republicans directly. They make him wait. A power play. Bartlett calls their bluff and walks out.\nGreat TV, but not realistic. Mind you, if TV was realistic, it would lose its drama. So apologies in advance – this column is more documentary than political thriller.\nI was elected in May 2019, and visited all the council leaders in Sunderland, Gateshead, Durham and South Tyneside. I asked their views on joining with Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland into one regional Combined Authority. All seven councils are together known as the LA7. Local councils lose no powers – everything new is devolved from Westminster.\nWhy? The North East needs to integrate buses, Metro, and rail. So people can get around the region quicker, cheaper and more reliably. The primary barrier to transport devolution is the Tyne & Wear Metro. 36 stations are north of the Tyne. 24 are south. You can’t devolve 60% of a system.\nPlus it was in my manifesto, and politicians should keep their promises. Sure, unpredictable events can knock you off course, but you must make every effort.\nWithin a month, Theresa May resigned as Prime Minister. In July Boris Johnson was elected Conservative leader. His first major speech promised “levelling up.”\nI spoke to Jake Berry, Northern Powerhouse Minister. If the LA7 unites, I asked, what’s on the table? You’d get more money, he replied, maybe an extra £5 million a year. We wouldn’t give you as much as Manchester – they get £30m a year, but have a much bigger population.\nNorth of Tyne gets £20m core funding. £5 million extra to double the size was a non-starter.\nThen Johnson prorogued Parliament. Government was in chaos. I got a letter from Jake Berry on 31st October 2019 offering me powers to fine people for smoking on buses. I’m not joking.\nSo after the 2019 election, I visited Treasury on 3rd February 2020. It’s one of those pub quiz questions – who was Chancellor at the time? Sajid Javid.\nOther city regions were getting 100’s of millions of devolved transport money. We weren’t. Can we have the money if we come together as an LA7, I asked? Not without a directly elected accountable individual, they said. In that case, I asked, can you allocate us the money on condition that we unite?\nThe Budget on March 11th, 2020, allocated hundreds of millions of transport funding for the North East – subject to a Mayoral Combined Authority including all of Tyne & Wear.\nThen Covid hit. And lockdown. And Dominic Cummings’ eye test in Barnard Castle.\nBut the phones still worked. My officers and I plugged away with Government ministers, and on 3rd June 2020 got a letter from Devolution minister Simon Clarke asking me to convene partners in the region to develop an economic recovery plan, and devolution proposals.\nAll seven council leaders worked well together through Covid, putting region above Party. We agreed a joint submission for Government investment in the region. It included the North East transport plan, and an economic package that later formed the basis of the devolution deal.\nIn September 2020 I convened a meeting of the LA7 leaders with the minster, Simon Clarke. Just days before that meeting, he resigned, for genuine personal reasons. The meeting was likely to be cancelled.\nI’d never heard of the new minister, Luke Hall, so Googled him. An MP in Gloucestershire. I rang the Tory metro Mayor for West of England. Got Luke Hall’s details, spoke to him, and the meeting went ahead. Some LA7 leaders had reservations, but all agreed to explore the possibility of LA7 devolution.\nSecond lockdown came. In January 2021 I met with Luke Hall, and Treasury Minister Kemi Badenoch. I pitched how more devolved investment and powers would generate a stronger North East economy. A win-win.\nAfter that meeting they wrote to me, copying in other North East leaders. Offering devolution to the whole LA7, with more money, and transport powers including bus franchising. This was 18th January 2021, and if we could agree outline details by March, we could have the money and powers in place for a new Mayoral election by May 2022. I said I was willing to shorten my term of office to allow such an election.\nHowever, 2021 was an election year for Northumberland, Durham, and the elected council Mayor in North Tyneside. Some didn’t want to be negotiating in the run up to those elections. So the consensus decision was to wait.\nThe May 2021 elections saw Labour lose control of Durham Council. I met the new Durham leadership. They felt a duty to their electorate to explore a Durham-only deal first – fair enough. Let me know if I can help, I said, it’s not a zero-sum game. A stronger Durham helps the rest of the North East.\nSpeaking of zero-sum games, some have criticised devolution deals for not reversing austerity. Our councils, NHS, schools, railways, and just about every public service have been cut since 2010. But devolution is not an either/or. Failing to land a deal gets you nothing, and lets down the people you’re elected to represent.\nIn the September 2021 reshuffle, Luke Hall was replaced by Neil O’Brien. His background was in think tanks. I phoned mutual contacts, and set up some calls. He was pro-devolution. The trick, as always, is getting money out of Treasury.\nAnd so in late autumn 2021 council leaders and I gave a formal mandate to our officials to negotiate a deal. Durham explored a separate county deal.\nNegotiations continued while Boris Johnson was under pressure over Partygate. On 11th March 2022 the council leaders and I met with Neil O’Brien in the Lumen, where the North of Tyne is based. We agreed a process to move forwards.\nI met with Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to add child poverty prevention to the devolution deal.\nAs we approached summer, the Johnson government became increasingly unstable. I wasn’t the only one worried a new PM might kibosh devolution.\nA total of 31 ministers resigned on 5th and 6th July 2022, forcing Mr. Johnson to resign. Government was paralysed. Greg Clark replaced Michael Gove as secretary of state for levelling up on the Thursday. By the Saturday morning I was talking to him to keep our devolution deal front and centre of his department’s priorities. Full credit to him, he came through for us.\nExcept for Metro funding. It’s complicated, but in essence, the Department for Transport said the new money meant they’d stop our existing funding stream. Our officials made a good counter argument, but DfT wouldn’t budge.\nI spoke to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. In Birmingham, or Manchester, people commute on the national rail network, funded by central Government, I said. So why are we penalised for having an efficient Metro system? Long story short, he was persuaded, but said the money would need to come from Treasury, not his department. I met with Simon Clarke, by this time Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In the end, we agreed the Metro funding in addition to the new money.\nAround this time, Durham’s leadership concluded they would not get a good enough deal on their own. They would certainly not get any transport money.\nI’d spoken to Treasury ministers about scaling up core funding from £20m a year at the North of Tyne, to £35 million for the LA6. That gave us more than Manchester (£30m) and almost as much as West Midlands (£36.5m) with much larger populations. It took a lot of persuading, but they agreed to £35 million.\nBut bringing in Durham would take us to £48 million a year. There were differences of opinion – putting it tactfully – about whether Durham could rejoin the deal at this late stage. There was genuine concern that Durham council might reject the deal, and delay the whole process.\nBy now Liz Truss had been and gone, and Michael Gove was back in post. I’d been speaking to him and his team for some time, nudging up the offer to £48m. We thrashed out the details in two final meetings with me, Mr Gove, and our council leaders.\nIndividual councillors might not have been involved in negotiations, but they do have a democratic mandate. That’s where our council leaders did all the work – bringing their councillor colleagues’ concerns to the table and getting agreement. I deserve no credit for that, my role was much more central government facing. As it should be.\nWe’re almost there. Only 3 of the original 7 council leaders are still in post. The council cabinets have all approved it, as have my cabinet and I. There’s a legal process to run, where the Secretary of State lays an order in Parliament this autumn. Then we have an election for Mayor in May 2024.\nAnd then a fortnight ago London Labour HQ took away the right for members in the North East to vote for me to be Labour candidate. Which is ironic, given that devolution is about letting people in a region make decisions. I suspect the devolution story is not over…. maybe it’s more like TV than I thought.\n*For those of you who are guessing what the building in the photo is, it’s the Treasury in Feb 2020",

It will fund the creation of co-ops and worker owned businesses by providing patient capital.\nToo often a local firm is sold when the owner wants to retire. It gets bought by big business, and after a few years, they take the customers, the intellectual property, and then close their North East operations. We’re making the money available for worker buy-outs, along with legal and financial advice.\nWe’ve funded Educo – a cooperative teachers’ supply agency set up by members of the NEU, NASUWT, and Unison. Many supply teachers and teaching assistants are zero-hours workers, who get no pension, no professional development (CPD) and the agencies take a huge slice of their earnings. Educo takes that top-sliced profit and pays the teachers’ pensions and CPD.\nI know it sounds like we’ve got funds coming out of our ears, but they work. Global finance has extracted wealth from regions like ours and laundered it through tax havens. It’s time we used these tools for the good of working people.\nWe’re also using the power of public procurement to help local firms win public sector work.

It will see flooding and storms of Biblical proportions. The economic damage will dwarf the 2007 crash and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIf we pass 3 degrees, we’ll see Southern Asia, the Mediterranean, and much of the US start to turn into a desert. We’ll see billions of people in Africa, Southern Asia, the Middle East and Central America displaced. A collapse in global trade. Worldwide food shortages. The whole world engulfed in a refugee crisis.\nThe UN published that current climate agreements will result in global temperature increases of 3.2 degrees.\nBusiness as usual is not an option.\nThe North of Tyne has already committed £24 million to a Green New Deal, creating jobs in offshore wind and low-carbon materials.

We’re working cross-regionally to develop a net-zero transport system. We’ll be net-zero organisation soon within years, not decades.\nWhat does a Citizens Assembly add?\nI saw a comment from someone committed to tackling climate change, who asked, “isn’t this an engineering problem?”\nIn March, the Chancellor announced £1bn for green transport. In the very next breath, he announced £27bn “for tarmac”. If he understood the climate reality, he’d have put £27bn into public transport.\nA trade union tried to lobby me to support opening a new coal mine. I’ve heard MPs say “if we all just do a little bit” – use a bit less energy, eat a bit less meat – we can solve the problem. I’m not sure how “we all just do a little bit” of installing an offshore wind farm.\nLife has a nasty habit of throwing up issues that don’t have a neat, self-contained solution. What if you’re a low-wage worker who has to drop the kids off to school on a rainy morning, before driving half an hour to work. Is it realistic to say, “cut down your emissions, buy a push-bike?”\nSo no, it’s not just an engineering problem. It’s a political problem, a social problem, and an economic problem.\nOur original plan for an in-person Citizens Assembly was scuppered by lockdown. We’re now tendering for a company to run the Assembly for us, with an online component. Details are on our website. Closing date is 18th August.\nWe’ll recruit a random sample of fifty people. Different ages, jobs, educational background, gender, ethnicity, the works. In a normal consultation, people with strong views are always over-represented. That’s why people selected will get paid for their time – so they’re motivated to participate even if they don’t have strong views. Also so those without much money can afford the time to participate.\nThey spend perhaps thirty hours together. First, getting up to speed on the issues. The climate science, and the local options. Then deliberating on how it would affect their lives. The tradeoffs they would be willing to make. Might I consider changing the way I shop? Would I be up for participating in a community energy scheme? What are the barriers to me walking or cycling more? Is there a hybrid way to travel, perhaps with an e-scooter on the bus? If so, how much better would the bus service need to be?\nThe questions will be guided by an advisory panel. They’ll be local authority officers, academic experts, and stakeholders.\nOnce the Assembly is concluded, the North of Tyne cabinet will evaluate the results. The wisdom of crowds will show us what else we could do, beyond our Green New Deal. Here’s another way to look at a Citizens’ Assembly. It’s democracy. Our lives have got to change.

It’s a long way however you travel. 3 hours by train, 6 hours by car and 27 hours by bike. But we’re even further in terms of media focus. The Westminster Bubble is obsessed with political manoeuvrings in Westminster. Try and get them to cover the creation of thousands of jobs in the North of Tyne, and they’re not interested.\nI guess that cuts both ways. The impression of London from here can be skewed. Many see it as a place of opportunity – career advancement, global HQs, the hub of media, arts and culture. The reality also includes extortionate rents and long commutes.\nOn Thursday I had a chance to correct the imbalance. I showed Adrian Wooldridge, The Economist’s political editor around the North of Tyne. He was keen to get out of the Westminster bubble.\nI love showing off our region. Our beautiful coastline, fascinating history, and vibrant culture. But most of all I love the stories of the people. We are resilient, entrepreneurial, and passionate. Too many lack opportunity, though. We need jobs. My role as Mayor of the North of Tyne Combined Authority is to fix that. Removing the barriers that stop people flourishing.\nI took him to visit the Cedarwood Trust in the Meadow Well. Run by Wayne Dobson and Alison Cunningham, it’s a charity and community centre. There’s a food club – not a food bank – that sells low cost food. And with funding from the North of Tyne, they help adult learners get the skills to earn a decent living. Retraining people on their terms, building confidence and self-esteem. Our visitor from London was struck by way people’s dignity was a priority.\nNext, we visited Phil Souter & colleagues at Proctor & Gamble’s Advanced Circular Economy Project in Benton. It’s a partnership with the North of Tyne, P&G, universities and local firms, developing cleaning products that use less heat and water. Last year Rhona, the R&D Vice President pitched it to me. She was really up-front, and told me her colleagues had said, “Don’t waste your time. Nothing happens for years if you talk to government.” Well, within months the project was up and running, creating high-paying high-tech jobs. That’s the strength of devolving power out of London, to regional Mayors.\nWe visited BritishVolt. Company Chairman, Peter Rolton, and his colleague Charlotte, drove us round the site. It is monumental in every way. Size. Jobs. Scale of ambition. And social and environmental responsibility. We’re working with BritishVolt to provide the training opportunities to make sure those 3000 jobs go to local people.\nNext to Transmission Dynamics in Cramlington. They use both human and artificial intelligence to solve complex engineering problems. Like smart bolts which fit on offshore wind turbines. It used to be that an engineer would have to sail out to the turbines to check all the bolts were within tolerances. With the smart bolts this can be monitored from land. It’s cheaper and saves time and fuel. Adrian asked development director Jenny Hudson what difference it made having a Mayor. “There’s someone to focus investment on our region’s strength – offshore renewables. It means businesses like ours can grow”. We spoke about the Catapult, our offshore wind projects, and how clean energy will replace our coal-dependent past.\nOur last visit was to Verisure, a global security firm now based near Longbenton. Kevin Croft was one of the directors I met when we persuaded them to set up here. “Why did you come here rather than London?” Adrian asked him. “The people are friendlier. It’s really true. And loyal – we want long term development of our staff. Plus I could by a four bedroom house with a garden for two-thirds the price of my 2 bedroom flat in London.”\nAdrian had never looked round our region in depth before. He knew it wasn’t all whippets and flat caps, but he wasn’t expecting to see such innovation and potential.\nI explained my vision. A well-paid job for everyone who wants one, with us as the powerhouse of the new, green economy. I asked him if he thought I would achieve my vision. “Yes,” he said.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 06 Sept 2021",

Two men in a pickup truck drew guns on him. One shot him in the chest with a shotgun, Mr Arbery tried to grab the gun, and was shot twice more and killed.\nPolice did not arrest the killers. They relied on the killers’ evidence, and who said they “had a gut feeling” he must have been a burglar. The prosecutor’s office advised it was self-defence because Arbery had refused to lie down on the ground when challenged. One of the killers previously worked as an investigator in the prosecutor’s office. Later video evidence and a witness reports show the killers standing over Mr Arbery’s dying body saying “Fucking n**ger.”\nOn the 13th of March, 26-year-old Breonna Taylor was shot dead while sleeping in her apartment. Police suspected there were drugs in her house, and without announcing themselves, tried to smash down her door in a dawn raid. Her boyfriend thought it was a home invasion, grabbed a gun, and shot at the door. The police fired 20 shots. Eight bullets hit Ms Taylor, killing her immediately. The police found no drugs. She was an emergency medical technician, a cross between an ambulance driver and a paramedic. She was also African-American. No charges were brought against her killers at the time.\nOn 25th May, 46-year-old George Floyd bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 note. It’s unknown if he knew it was a forgery. Police arrested & cuffed him, and made him lie face down in the street. Police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Mr Floyd’s neck for over 8 minutes. Mr Floyd begged for his life, telling officers “I can’t breathe,” at least sixteen times before he was killed.\nInitial police reports claimed he was resisting arrest. Video footage from multiple eye witnesses show Mr Floyd was calm and not resisting.\nFor each of these three killings there are hundreds of unreported beatings and abuses of power.\nThis week I saw a Newcastle City Council Facebook post in solidarity with the #BlackLivesMatter campaign. It attracted hundreds of comments.\nMany criticised the council’s stance, saying “what about Lee Rigby?”\nLee Rigby was a 25-year-old soldier in the Royal Fusiliers, who supported Help for Heroes. In 2013 he was run down then brutally murdered by two men on his way back to barracks. It was a deliberate and premeditated attack.\nUnarmed police were first at the scene, then armed police. When the killers charged at them, police opened fire, wounding them. The killers were charged, prosecuted, and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum sentence of 45 years.\nLee Rigby’s life mattered. The authorities behaved as if it did, and acted swiftly to uphold the law. Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd died because those in authority didn’t believe black lives matter.\nIt’s about power, intertwined with a long, long history of racism. When the authorities who are supposed to protect you are the same people who are killing you, people are right to be angry. They are right to protest.\nIn the coverage of the protests, black CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was arrested by police officers live on television, despite asking the police where he should move. Just one block away, the police told white CNN reporter Josh Campbell, “Ok, you’re good.”\nSo if you hear someone say, “All lives matter,” ask them to think for a moment. Imagine you’re black. You’ve lived with racism all your life. You see racist graffiti every day. The authorities treat you with suspicion. You have to try that bit harder to succeed. You see black people being killed by white police. And then when you post, “Black lives matter,” someone says “All lives matter!” How would you feel?\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 8.6.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_we-need-to-share-the-fruits-of-our-harvest/content_162.html": "We need to share the fruits of our harvest\nOctober 29, 2023\nYou know the song, Monster Mash, that gets wheeled out at Halloween parties? I’m sure some of us have been guilty of some pretty monstrous dancing to this after a few too many ‘witches brews’. But the title got me thinking. Many of our Halloween traditions are a mash-up.\nWe tend to assume our own childhood was ‘typical’. Why wouldn’t we? It’s when we adopted our cultural heritage.\nChatting with my team at work revealed otherwise. As kids, my brothers and sister carved Halloween lanterns from turnips. Stick in a candle, then off round the streets to knock on doors. Kind-hearted adults would feign amazement at our artistic skills and hand us a 5p or 10p coin. I was once so overjoyed to get 50p, I still remember gazing at it, open mouthed, in the palm of my hand.\nToday kids get sweets, not money. I’d assumed that was the passage of time, and American TV influence. Apparently not. One of my team, only a few years younger, is from London. They had pumpkins, and always “trick or treated”. My wife is from Liverpool. Her mam told her ‘respectable’ children did not ask for money. So she secretly went out ‘tricking’ with her friends. No treats. And despite being out there in the zeitgeist, I’ve never seen anyone bobbing for apples.\nAnd yes, we carved turnips. I was a teenager before I realised that ‘pumpkin’ was actually a different vegetable, and not an alternative name. Don’t get me started on turnip vs swede.\nAfter explaining this to my kids a few years back, they wanted to try carving a turnip. Or swede. Whatever. While you can scoop out a pumpkin with an ice-cream spoon, turnip-swedes need a strong, sharp knife and a firm hand.\nOne year my younger son was going through a James Bond phase. Intrigued by cold war spies and Soviet double agents. He carved a hammer and sickle insignia into his lantern, effected a theatrical Russian accent, and ‘Comrade Turnip’ was born. “Ah, Meester Bond, you will tell us everything once you taste delicious Russian turnip!” Needless to say, Comrade Turnip was a limited-edition Halloween tradition.\nThat’s the thing about traditions – they’re always changing and morphing. Our traditions, like our language, are Celtic, Roman, Saxon, Angle, Viking, Norman… the list goes on. Everything British is an accretion of many cultures. I recall one TV sketch which encapsulates this beautifully.\n“How many times a week, on average, do you eat curry?” asks David Walliams, playing a xenophobic immigration officer.\n“On no, I don’t like curry,” says Matt Lucas, playing a British Asian with a Bradford accent. “No, I prefer English food, you get me? Like pizza or Chinese.”\nYou can watch the full sketch HERE.\nFood is the basis of our cultural festivals. Finding comfort at a fearful time. The coming of winter. Did the harvest yield enough food to see us through to spring? Would winter be harsh and claim the lives of cattle or even family? The reaper felt very close at this time of year.\nSharing these fears and finding comfort remains important. Today’s Britain has no shortage of food. But wealth inequality means there’s a shortage of money to buy it.\nIn agricultural societies, you were dependent on the harvest. In ours you’re dependent on your income from work. Unless you owned large amounts of land, or today, financial assets.\nA hard-working medieval peasant could still starve through bad weather. Today, hard-working people can still be raising their kids in destitution. Unable to afford the essentials of heating, food and shelter.\nLast week’s Joseph Rowntree Foundation report documented 3.8 million people experiencing destitution last year. Including 1 million children. Yet three-quarters of poor children live in households with working adults.\nKeeping people in poverty costs us a fortune. The Conservatives are on their way out. Sadly, they’re more likely to hand out tax cuts to the rich than tackle extreme poverty.\nThree weeks ago I called upon the Labour Party to commit to ending destitution in the next Parliament. It’s morally right, makes economic sense, and would be popular on the doorstep. They should start by scrapping the inhumane two child benefit cap.\nAs Mayor I’ve created thousands of new jobs. Our ground-breaking child poverty prevention programme is doing great work in 98 schools. It has been hailed as a model of best practice. It’s changing lives, but it’s a drop in the ocean.\nMillions are living in fear of poverty and debt. Every day I see communities banding together to help each other. We need our party leaders to find some courage to help them. Like those early societies, we must continue to offer the warmth of our fires and the fruits of our harvest with those that need it most.",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-north-will-remember/content_212.html": "The North Will Remember\nNovember 1, 2020\nOn September 18th, the North East’s council leaders and I asked government for the powers to impose additional restrictions. We knew that cases were rising. We knew that government’s insistence on keeping universities open, with face-to-face teaching was a mistake. Government did nothing, so we did what we could. And it worked, as well as can be expected. Within a couple of weeks our case rate had stopped climbing. As I write, we’re the only place in England where cases have stabilised.\nGovernment still tried to force us into Tier 3, using press leaks to make it seem inevitable. We argued with them repeatedly, and showed their data did not support it. Government’s own medical officers accepted this. But political advisors from no 10 thought that something must be seen to be done, so kept trying to force us. That’s how government operates these days. Evidence is just a secondary consideration. Our fight wasn’t as public as Manchester’s, but all our region’s leaders – cross party – stood strong.\nNow we face national lockdown. We know that the virus spreads faster when the weather is cold, and dark and wet. People are inside more. Windows are closed, ventilation is poor. Winter is coming.\nThe main reason I opposed Tier 3 is because it would not have worked. I’ve been told by public health officials that it’s not spreading in restaurants and non-essential retail. It’s schools, universities, care homes and workplaces. None of which is affected by Tier 3. None of which is closed by the National Lockdown. We need to target infections in those places, and closure is not the only tool.\nWe’ve been pressing for months for better test and trace linked in with our local expert teams. You may have heard me on the telly, asking for support while we were in Tier 2, rather than leaving it too late. I’ve been lobbying hard for powers to close noncompliant businesses or public spaces. Finally, the legislation will go through Parliament this week.\nOne example shows why we need this. A nail bar in the North West had a sign in the window: “Covid is a hoax. No masks allowed in here.” The local public health officials went round to explain how dangerous this was, but were told to eff off. The police went, and the owners took the sign down. Then put it up again after the police left.\nThis is an insult to all the businesses who are keeping people safe. All the pubs and restaurants who are impeccably following the guidance. All the independent businesses that people have put their money and their effort into, and who have paid their taxes for years. I want to protect these businesses.\nSome cases spread because people don’t follow the rules. So please, respect social distancing, don’t mix with people from other households (except for a support bubble), wear your mask in public, and wash your hands. This disease is dangerous. Even if it doesn’t harm you, you could pass it on to someone more vulnerable.\nI always try to build good working relationships with people. Political leaders, business owners, trade unionists, religious leaders, charity workers, and, of course, all the staff in my own team. Political posturing achieves little. My politics are strongly socialist, but I know to implement anything that makes a difference means taking people with me. I look for solutions that work.\nBut this must be said: this government holds Northerners in contempt. As if denying free school meals to kids in poverty wasn’t enough. Now we know for certain that Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove think Northerners are second class citizens. When they were trying to force us into Tier 3, along with the rest of the North, all of the people whose jobs would have been shut down would have got 67% of their wages. We were told it was a red line. Non-negotiable. As soon as London and the South East are going into lockdown, furlough is back up to 80%.\nThis government doesn’t care about the North, or our people. When it comes to the next election, send them a message: The North Remembers.\nOriginally published in the Journal a Evening Chronicle 2 November 2020",

My younger son is the same age I was back in 2022.\nGlobal average temperatures are 2 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels.\nLondon is 6 degrees hotter in its warmest month. The summer heatwave of 2022 is now an annual event.\nMuch of the Northumberland coast is under attack by rising sea levels. Blyth is underwater. Jarrow and Gateshead are regularly flooded.\n400 million people in China have been displaced by flooding and are now experiencing starvation. The 2020 floods there look like puddles by comparison.\nThe remaining Amazon rainforest – half the size it was at the end of the twentieth century – is on fire.\nArctic summer sea ice hasn’t been seen for two decades. The world’s refrigerator is on its last legs.\nGlobal trade has broken down. Global cooperation is strained as new pandemics emerge in hot spots around the world. The 2020 Covid pandemic now looks like a drill.\nAn eighth of the world’s population now live in refugee camps.1.2 billion people. 200 times more refugees than 2022.\nAnd that’s what kills us. Not the weather. The entire world’s supply chains have collapsed. Failed states are the norm in the global South. Our industrial capacity to build a zero-carbon future is gone.\nThat’s one version of the future – the one we’re on target for. And 630 lobbyists from fossil fuel companies are at COP27 in Egypt right now, with the express purpose of making sure we keep burning fossil fuels.\nHow about an alternative?\nThat’s why we’re launching Net Zero North East England this week.\nThe climate emergency won’t wait for the Government to get its act together. So we’re not waiting. Big businesses. Small businesses. Voluntary sector. Public sector. Private sector. Everyone around the table. Everyone with the will to take action. It was also a commitment in my manifesto to bring the region together like this, and it’s happening.\nIn the North of Tyne we’re taking action every day.\nWe’ve put our own house in order. Our offices in the Lumen emit 364 fewer tonnes of carbon than similar office blocks every year. We’ve planted trees to offset the remaining emissions.\nWe’re investing in our future energy system so we’ll never again face the kind of energy price crisis that’s crippling family budgets today: £25 million in offshore wind – 15% of our budget. If the Government matched that percentage it’d be spending £169 billion a year. It’s actually spending £285 million.\nWe’ve launched a £2 million programme to equip people with green skills: retrofitting homes, maintaining electric vehicles, battery storage, wind turbine engineers.\nWe’ve launched a Green New Deal Fund to cut emissions and create jobs. £18 million for schools, nurseries, councils, small businesses, NGOs, housing associations. 28 projects already on the stocks.\nWe’ve audited our region’s housing stock. We’ve developed a plan to decarbonise homes through low-carbon heating and better insulation. As soon as central Government makes funding available – and it will eventually – we’ll be ready to move without delay.\nWe’re bringing new green employers to the region and helping the ones who are already here.\n4,685 new jobs being created. 3,546 more than our target set by Government. 14 years’ progress in 3 and a half years.\nWe’re taking people with us and leaving no behind on our journey to net zero.\nThat’s why we commissioned a Citizens’ Assembly on climate change. A cross-section of the community looked at the issues in depth and told me what they thought we should do. 30 hours of their time, 30 recommendations. We’re implementing them. That’s democracy in action.\nWe’ve run the Mayor’s Climate Challenge in schools across the region. Giving kids the opportunity to grapple with the climate science and gain practical skills.\nAnd we’ve created Crowdfund North of Tyne for small-scale community projects that make a difference to people’s everyday lives. We’ve helped community gardens, rewilders, community kitchens, orchards, beekeeping, bicycle repair and more.\nWe’re just one Combined Authority with a tiny budget. Imagine what the whole country could do led by a government that takes this seriously.\nWell we’re not just imagining – we’re getting on with it, and building a fairer, more prosperous world at the same time.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_transforming-our-region-with-full-employment/content_280.html": "Transforming Our Region With Full Employment\nMay 21, 2023\nI’m old enough to remember Norman Tebbit telling the British public to get on your bike and look for work – like his old man had done in the 1930s. He was Employment Secretary at the time, speaking to Conservative Party conference in 1981.\nWe’d seen riots in Brixton and Toxteth. Riots that had their roots in unemployment, deprivation and racial disadvantage. The Tories were in power, blaming immigrants and trade unions, and inflation was running at over 10%. Sound familiar?\nFull employment means a secure, well-paid job for everyone who wants one. That means more job creation, more access to training for workers, and a better transport system so people can access the jobs wherever they live.\nOf course, not everyone can work, and our benefits system needs to stop trapping people in poverty. That needs change in central government.\nFull employment used to be a core policy of the Labour movement. There are currently 68,725 people unemployed in the North East, and many more ‘economically inactive’. And 25% of all those in employment are in insecure, zero-hours, or temporary work, including bogus self-employment.\nThere will inevitably be what economists call frictional unemployment – where people are between jobs for a month or two, or after leaving education. But we can eliminate mismatch unemployment – that’s where there are jobs available, but people’s skills or life circumstances don’t match what employers need.\nBetter transport will help – I know of young people in Blyth who had to turn down jobs in Team Valley because public transport couldn’t get them there. An integrated Total Transport Network will fix this.\nAs North of Tyne Mayor I have one major target from Government: create 10,000 jobs over 30 years. After four years as Mayor that jobs pipeline should be 1,333. The actual number is 5,049 direct, full-time equivalent jobs. That’s half the 30-year target in just 4 years, through a pandemic, and we didn’t even have pens for the whiteboards on my first day. I’ll stack my record on economic competence against the Government’s anytime.\nWhere are these jobs coming from?\nJobs in digital technology, with companies like Verisure in Quorum business park near Four Lane Ends. Thoughtworks and MonstarLabs on Grey Street. Credra and Leonardo on the Helix, near St James. Plus Omnicom, Version 1 and Xplor. One thousand people employed by these companies already, and they’re recruiting right now – for software engineers, technicians, account managers, and even a global director based here, in the North East.\nJobs in manufacturing. Everything from high-tech sensors for offshore wind by Transmission Dynamics in Northumberland Business Park, to high-tech chocolate manufacture by SweetDreams in Cramlington. Seriously – they have high-tech welding for Easter Eggs.\nWe’ve created Jobs in local small and medium enterprises – like joinery firm Cronin. Helping them switch to a digital tracking system tripled their workshop output. They recruited new joiners and new apprentices. They’re now exporting around the globe – out of their factory in Palmersville, North Tyneside.\nLast year the North East was the number one region in the country for job creation from inward investment. We beat London. But you probably won’t have seen that on the national news.\nI was at a global investment conference in Leeds last week, negotiating to get more investment and job creation here. I bumped into Tony Wells, MD of Merit, who make modular clean rooms for the biotech industry. We helped them buy a derelict factory in Cramlington, and expand their operations. They’ve gone from 130 to 330 jobs, including going from 9 to 87 graduates, and 61 apprentices.\nWe can talk about facts and figures. But I love it when I meet the people who’ve got these jobs. Like Dale, at Norfran in North Shields. I asked him what he did before this job, “I worked away, mostly in the Baltic region. Now I’m home every night. I’ve got a young daughter and now I get to read her a bedtime story.”\nIf everyone has a secure, well-paid job, it would transform our region. Parents will no longer have to raise their kids in poverty. Crime will fall. Health inequalities will close. Why would we ever have an economic strategy that demands less?\nShy bairns get nowt.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_like-bond-lets-just-get-the-job-done/content_272.html": "Like Bond, Let’s Just Get the Job Done\nOctober 10, 2021\nWhen I was elected Mayor in 2019, I joined the group of Metro Mayors already in existence, and became ‘M9’. The first meeting was in London’s City Hall, where SPECTRE was filmed, doubling as villain C’s HQ. I was disappointed Sadiq Khan wasn’t stroking a white cat.\n‘I’m straight out of a Bond movie’ I said to my family, who appeared to be less than convinced. I reminded them that I’m a black-belt in jiu jitsu, and own a tuxedo, but apparently being Bond takes more than that.\nAnyway, we all went to see the new Bond at the Tyneside last week – highly recommend and don’t worry, no spoilers – and it set me thinking about the whole series of films.\nJames Bond has been a British icon since Ian Fleming published Casino Royale in 1953. Bond is always portrayed as a heroic loner. But he depends on a backup team. Q’s extraordinary gadgets – including the visionary message-carrying digital watch from The Spy Who Loved Me. M provides the political cover to operate. Miss Moneypenny’s peerless organisation skills. And a whole team of people providing intelligence and logistical support, sometimes even entire ships’ crews.\nSome of the Bond plots, as with the messaging watch, have been remarkably prescient. Okay, none of them foresaw food and petrol shortages, but then neither did Mr Johnson’s government.\nIn Quantum of Solace, there’s no moonbase or “laser” superweapon. The CIA are involved in regime change and the villains are manipulating utility prices by monopolising the access to water. Take out the stunts, and it’s a documentary. Which makes me wonder – is the chaos of an unregulated market economy causing the latest gas price hikes, or is Blofeld behind it?\nBond villains always have grandiose plans that never work. Often involving improbable construction projects like a bridge to Northern Ireland or airbase in the middle of a river estuary. They treat their underlings with contempt, and make long speeches instead of taking action, in denial that the world is falling into chaos around them…\nBond doesn’t faff about, laughing maniacally. He just gets the job done. As I often say, done is better than perfect.\nWhat would solve our current problems better than Bond’s actions? A high-wage economy, that’s what. Anyone who wants to take over the world would be better deployed making it a better place.\nHowever we view the problem, the solution is the same. We need the people in the North East to have a higher real income. That means generating – and retaining – more wealth in our region. I’m talking about full employment in secure jobs, paying decent wages. This requires and supports a better transport system, higher levels of skills and education, healthier lifestyles, and affordable, secure homes.\nIt requires an economic model where there’s a job for everyone who wants one, and where wages are high enough to live a life of contentment. That includes sectors traditionally regarded as low-paid, including social care, hospitality, distribution and retail workers. We must focus on improving the foundational economy with as much energy as the high-productivity sectors of digital and manufacturing. This means providing more skills training and professionalisation, so the workforce becomes more valued and better paid, resulting in lower staff turnover and higher productivity.\nWe’re succeeding, but not quickly enough to close the gap any time soon. I was elected just two years ago, and already the North of Tyne has attracted global firms that practice what they preach, training and developing workers to have careers, not just jobs. We’re creating jobs in key sectors of offshore renewables, clean energy technology, zero-carbon automotive, digital, and healthy ageing and life sciences. We have programmes supporting small- and medium-sized businesses by the hundred, investing in innovation, digital adoption and job creation. We’re supporting freelancers in the culture and creative sectors.\nThis new economic model for the North East must be built on a green economy. Financial security need not consume more of the Earth’s resources or emit more greenhouse gasses. Our wealth can be spent on art, leisure, entertainment, PassivHaus homes and transport with ultra-low emissions. We can build a wellbeing economy. Like Bond, let’s just get the job done.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 11 Oct 2021",

There’s nothing like a global pandemic to make us realise that simply spending time with our family is the most important thing.\nI know many people will find it tough not seeing their families this Christmas. Like many, my family decided not to spend Christmas together this year, even before the latest announcement. It’s a hard decision but the right one for us. Everyone’s situation is different and you have to do what is right for you. There aren’t many bonuses but one has got to be not being able to fall out over Trivial Pursuit.\nThe fantastic thing about family Christmas traditions is that they develop over time. They morph as families change and new people are added. As kids grow from toddlers to teenagers. They can seem so normal to people brought up with it and only exposed when a new partner or friend observes it for the first time. And then you are outed as the crazy people who open their presents AFTER Christmas lunch!\nAs the social side of Christmas is somewhat limited this year, I’m sure food will be centre stage for many. It definitely will be for me and my family. However, some people do not have that option. There are some unbelievable facts about the prevalence of low wages. Low wages make families have to choose between heating and eating. The New Economics Foundation found that by next April a third of the UK population will be living on an income with which they can’t afford the basics for a decent standard of living. This inequality is causing food poverty. The richest 10% of households in Great Britain hold 44% of wealth. The poorest 50%, by contrast, own just 9%. In the sixth richest national it is just not acceptable.\nI’ll be watching the programme tonight following Marcus Rashford’s food poverty campaign. He’s doing a cracking job but it’s a sad indictment on this country that it’s taken a footballer to step in to help address this problem. It’s shameful that 320 Conservative MPs voted to against feeding kids over school holidays. That Jacob Rees Mogg complained about UNICEF feeding hungry British children.\nImagine if the spacemen who came travelling in Chris de Burgh’s song saw the queuing at food banks. I bet he would be baffled at how a prosperous country could let it happen.\nThis year the North of Tyne Combined Authority chose the West End Food Bank as its charity. The staff have raised an impressive amount of money to donate. They do such a fantastic job of catching and supporting people when they are most in need. A fantastic project that makes me proud to come from the North East.\nWe’re doing what we can through the North of Tyne Combined Authority by creating good jobs on decent wages. We are supporting people into employment through training and looking at innovative ways to address the underlying causes. I’m not going to stop pushing on this issue until there is zero poverty.\nThis experience will not leave us and in time may even be a source of pride that we were there and we got through it together.\nMy youngest son is an aspiring Thespian. His favourite speech is the St Crispin’s day speech from Henry V. That’s the one where Henry V inspires his troops before battle and reminds them how they will feel in the pub afterwards. “Then will he strip his sleeves and show his scars, and say ‘these wounds I had on Crispin’s day’”.\nThis year was not easy, and next year will be challenging too. The North East has stuck together and that feels right. That’s the kind of North East people want to live in. I’ll keep on fighting for the recovery. We can get through this if we stick together.\nLet’s embrace differences, even if it means enduring sprouts for Christmas dinner.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 21.12.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_listen-to-those-you-disagree-with/content_216.html": "Listen To Those You Disagree With\nFebruary 7, 2021\nThe act of listening matters. Hearing viewpoints different to your own is an essential part of a healthy political climate. It’s the only route to effective democracy.\nSo who should politicians listen to first? Billionaires? Newspaper owners? Lobbyists? That’s the list that worries people – that those with influence exercise it unhealthily and selfishly. It’s a legitimate worry.\nAn underplayed danger is politicians listening to people who stroke their egos. It’s human to enjoy being flattered, and made to feel important. It’s self-affirming to meet people who agree with you.\nBut here’s the real kicker: only meeting people who don’t give them a hard time. Listening to someone is not the same as agreeing with them. It does mean appreciating that there is a different viewpoint, and trying to understand it. Today’s politics is so febrile – the slightest Twitter slip is pounced upon – that politicians are increasingly controlling about their public image. It’s a vicious circle that motivates the media to try to outflank the spin doctors and minders, and seek out the member of the public who will have a pop.\nThe best antidote is to not base your self-esteem on your public approval. Denis Healey famously said that politicians require a hinterland. A breadth and depth gained from knowledge and pursuits outside of politics. Literary, artistic, scientific, sporting. And family, of course. I have time marked out when I switch off my phone, and spend it with my kids. It’s too easy to become a workaholic in this job.\nListening isn’t just for politicians. We’d all be wiser to weigh evidence before grandstanding. Some people spend their lives on transmit. Social media gives a platform to arm-chair experts, with evidence-free opinions on everything from the biomedical science of vaccination to the mechanics of international trade. In a previous era, we’d hear these people across the pub, five pints the worse for wear.\nI meet with organised interest groups all the time: big business, small business, trade unions, transport user groups, human rights campaigners, Citizens UK, local business forums, religious leaders, and so on. Their specialist knowledge is valuable. Discussion allows us to drill down behind the strap-lines and find workable solutions.\nMost interesting, though, are when I meet people who have no specific agenda. Last week I met 6th formers online, from schools across North Tyneside. They spoke of the impact lockdown is having on their lives. How they are making their career choices – or deliberately not making choices yet. Their hopes to not have to move away from the North East to have good job prospects. The economic effects on their family when parents lose their jobs. The changes they want to see in the world.\nThese kinds of insights are invaluable. After all, young people are the experts in understanding young people. A core aim of all our work on skills and job creation is to make sure that our young people can have a prosperous and stable future in the North East and don’t have to head to London to have a career.\nThe NHS Patient Charter introduced in 2015 is based on the core NHS principal of “No decision about me without me”. This means listening and consulting directly with patients in all decision making about their treatment.\nFocus groups and the advice of marketing gurus are no substitute for real engagement with real people. Especially those historically marginalised, such as our Red Wall constituencies. Poverty is an increasing problem in our region. The impact of Covid will be severe.\nPoor families are rarely listened to or given a voice. That’s why we are working with the Poverty Truth Network to establish a Poverty Truth Commission for North of Tyne.\nFair pay and secure, unionised jobs are the foundation for dealing with poverty. But the individual causes and consequences of poverty are engulfed in myth and prejudice. Listening to lived experience will help us develop the interventions that will make a practical difference.\nPutting listening into practice this way is well worth the effort. It makes democracy work\n.Originally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 8.2.21",

Despite the pandemic, I’ve already delivered on 92% of my manifesto pledges, including my promise to bring the region together into one single Mayoral Combined Authority.\nI left school at 16, and returned to education as a mature student, gaining a degree in Engineering at Northumbria University. I went on to run my own business as a software developer. When my wife and I had kids, I wound back my business and became the main carer for our children – and loved (almost) every minute of it!\nI have always been an active campaigner against racism. I am a black belt in jiu jitsu. My commitment to the climate emergency prompted me to give up owning a car, I now cycle and use public transport – which raises a smile when I turn up at mayoral events on my bike, wearing a suit and tie! I am a White Ribbon Ambassador, the campaign to stop men’s violence against women and girls.\nI didn’t become a politician until I was 48. My Dad drove a tank in the army, and was a shift worker at ICI after he left. My Mam was a youth worker, trade unionist, and set up the first Women’s Refuge from Domestic Violence in Middlesbrough.\nI live in Gosforth with my wife Caroline, who’s a GP in Gateshead, who I’m still head over heels in love with after 28 years together, and my two sons, who are studying GCSEs and A-levels.\nPolitical Positions\nWhat matters above all else is that we elect a Mayor who can actually deliver for the people of the North East. I’ve given you bucketloads of evidence that I already have. Inevitably, though, people want to know: what do you believe?\nI’m an engineer. Fixing broken systems is what I do.\nMy politics are simple – I believe Britain should be run in the interests of the people who do the work. That includes those unable to work, and those retired from a lifetime of work. It’s not left-wing. It’s not right-wing. It’s common sense.\nI value patriotism – and believe it’s expressed by public service, not xenophobia. My Dad drove a tank in the army, my brother served in the navy at the time of the Falklands. My Mam set up the first Women’s Refuge from Domestic Violence in Middlesbrough.\nThese are policies I support, but can’t promise to deliver because they are central government matters. That said, I do lobby for them.\n- Stronger democracy. People in local areas know what’s best for them.\n- A fully public NHS. Roll back the creeping privatisation that extracts profit.\n- Wealth Tax. Huge concentrations of wealth damage our society and hamper our economy. An annual tax of say 1% of all assets above £2 million would raise enough money to end poverty, provide free tuition, and end all NHS waiting lists.\n- Common ownership of utilities. Including rail, mail, power and water. In our region alone, an American billionaire makes £135 million profit a year from Powergrid, and a Hong Kong billionaire makes around £200 million a year from Northumbrian Water. That money should stay here.\n- Universal Basic Income. As artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles develop, we face a choice. Do we let the rich get richer, or do we give everyone the financial stability to retrain, re-educate, and contribute in other ways?\n- Proportional Representation. And federalism. Britain’s first past the post system is dysfunctional, and far too much power is centralised in Westminster and Whitehall.\n- Repeal of repressive Trade Union laws. Not just this year’s Minimum Service Levels legislation, but all the anti-union laws of recent decades.\n- Repeal of oppressive anti-freedom laws. The right to protest has now been redefined in the UK as a privilege that exists at the discretion of the police. And Prevent is not having its claimed effect, but engenders racism and discrimination.\n- Free tuition. Education is an investment in society. Tuition fees – and the outrageous interest rates on them – are saddling young people with decades of debt. Poorer families are paying more than affluent ones.\n- Regulation of the media. Full implementation of the Leveson recommendations. The billionaire press is no friend of progressive movements, and undermines our collective future.\n- I’m also a White Ribbon Ambassador, and have made the North of Tyne a White Ribbon organisation. This is the campaign to get men to take a stand against other men who use, excuse, or remain silent about men’s violence against women.",

Appointments to committees, scrutiny reports, and dozens of pages of accounts.\nBut they are a keystone of democracy and accountability. It shows the public, amongst other things, what we’ve spent. The corporate budget is our running costs: staff wages, office accommodation, IT spending, legal fees, that we spend delivering our targets.\nWe’re smashing those targets out of the park. We have a commitment to government to create 10,000 new, full-time jobs over 30 years. It’s two years and one month since I was elected, so we should have 700 jobs in the pipeline. The actual results? Across 66 live projects, we’ve leveraged in £193 million of extra money, we’re creating 4,193 jobs, and safeguarded another 2,673 jobs. Over 10,000 people have had new training opportunities. We’ve a whole catalogue of projects tackling climate change, helping communities, building homes, supporting local businesses and protecting vulnerable people in our region.\nAt the same time our corporate running costs came in £599,000 under budget. Given the disruption of the last fifteen months under the pandemic, that is a remarkable achievement. I’m proud staff team we’ve built at the North of Tyne. National government could only dream of being this effective and efficient.\nYet you won’t see a headline anywhere that reads, “Mayor quietly exceeds his targets while coming in under budget.” Despite the fact that the vast majority of people want their politicians to do exactly that. So if you could spread the word, I’d appreciate it.\nInstead politicians criticise England footballers for taking the knee. Or Gareth Southgate’s open letter defining Englishness. For what it’s worth, I agree with the England manager. But like me, his tenure should, ultimately, be judged by results.\nSo back to the excitement that was the North of Tyne Combined Authority’s Annual General Meeting. Since March 2020, the emergency Covid regulations have allowed us meet and take decisions online. But in their wisdom, those who write the regulations coming out of Whitehall tell us we must now meet in person.\nInfection control procedures are still in place, and we lead by example, and maintaining the highest standards of public health. Masks, distancing, hand sanitizer. So it was still far from back to normal. And quite right too – the Delta variant is highly transmissible. As I said in my opening remarks at the AGM, please make sure you get both doses of your vaccine as soon as you’re eligible. I had my second dose weeks ago.\nWe rotate our meetings around the region. So there we were, in a function suite in Newcastle Civic Centre, distanced so far apart that we needed microphones to talk to each other. A warm welcome to new cabinet members Karen Kilgour from Newcastle, Carl Johnson from North Tyneside and Richard Wearmouth from Northumberland.\nPlacing thanks on record to our outgoing cabinet members Joyce McCarty, Bruce Pickard and Richard Dodd. Continuing our partnership with the North East LEP, represented by Lucy Winskell, and the voluntary sector, represented by Robin Fry.\nAnd agreeing our corporate plan for the next three years, strongly backed by our existing cabinet members, Norma Redfearn, Nick Forbes and Glen Sanderson, leaders of our three local authorities.\nZero-Carbon, Zero-Poverty is our objective. We’ve completed our Citizens Assembly on Climate Change, and our Green New Deal is motoring. The best way to defeat poverty is to create thousands of good, green jobs – and we’re doing that in spades. But at Tuesday’s AGM, we also agreed our Child Poverty Prevention Programme. A series of initiatives to directly assist families who are struggling financially.\nThat 22% of kids in the North East are in poverty is a moral outrage. It’s also economically dysfunctional – we all benefit when bairns get a good start in life. The irony is that over 70% of kids in poverty come from working households. We need to make work pay.\nWe’ll know the job’s done when our regional economy is so rich and vibrant that everyone can build a life here, and our young people don’t need to move away to pursue their dreams.\nAGMs can be a compelling part of democracy after all.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 14 June 2021",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_when-the-boat-comes-in/content_223.html": "When The Boat Comes In\nApril 5, 2021\nI just about remember the TV show ‘When the Boat Comes In’. It was set in the fictional town of Gallowshields in the North East. If you’ve seen it even once, you’ll remember the theme tune, “Thou shalt have a fishy, on a little dishy, thou shalt have a fishy when the boat comes in.\n”It’s sung by Alex Glasgow – who also wrote and sang ‘The Socialist ABC’ with its wonderful sardonic ending. ‘Dance To Thy Daddy’ is based on old Geordie folk song, and predates the chapbook “Songs of the Bards of the Tyne” from 1850. We’ve been fishing from the Tyne for a long, long time.\nThe origins of North Shields Fish Quay date back to 1225 and Tynemouth Monastery. It was a natural safe anchorage, where the Pow Burn flowed into the Tyne. Today it’s the heart of our fishing industry and England’s biggest prawn port.\nThe central harbour is known as the Gut, and the Pow Burn still flows into it, albeit through a culvert nowadays. The concrete jetty protects the fishing boats from weather and waves, and the strong tidal currents. Boats moor up at the landing quays and unload their catch. Close by is the fresh fish market, and the processing plants, fish shops and restaurants.\nThe Fish Quay attracts visitors all year round to eat, drink and take in the heritage of the place. There are beautiful outdoor areas to spend time and enjoy. It’s a unique and valuable part of North Tyneside and is a real celebration of local trade.\nYou could set up a fish restaurant anywhere, and people do. But it’s the Fish Quay that provides the anchor (see what I did there?) for all these other local businesses to flourish. In a global world of corporate fast food, local character should be cherished.\nBut the Jetty needs repairing. This part of the harbour has been closed for access since November 2017. The harbour is still in use, but if the jetty goes altogether, we’ll lose our fishing industry.\nWhich is why the North of Tyne is co-funding the rebuilding of the jetty. This will protect 56 local businesses that support over 300 jobs. I’ve been working with Norma Redfearn at North Tyneside Council on a whole raft of investments.\nThe North Shields ferry landing is being moved to the Fish Quay. This will integrate local transport links, and strengthen the local businesses.\nWe’ve provided funding to North Tyneside Council to help with the regeneration of North Shields Town Centre. The North Shields Masterplan is a hugely ambitious piece of work to build hundreds of new homes, regenerate derelict land, and protect our fishing industry while improving the local transport, and the look, leisure and economy of the area.\nThe North East’s heritage is one of heavy industry and heavy work. Unfortunately that has left heavily contaminated land in its wake. In North Tyneside, we’re using our Brownfield Housing Fund to remediate old industrial land in places like North Shields. And, as you’d expect from a region with a rich seam of coalmining history, there’s a lot of old coal workings underneath our feet. We’re using our Brownfield Housing Fund to grout coal seams to ensure that development that takes place above is safe and secure.\nBut what are we helping to develop? Norma is the North of Tyne cabinet member for Housing and Land. We have designed our Brownfield Housing Fund programme to reflect the wide variety of housing needs in the area. It’s not just more homes we need. We need affordable council housing available for social rent. We need affordable properties for first time homeowners. We need new rented sector properties for young professionals to make sure we have somewhere for our young graduates to live. And we’re co-funding major regeneration works to the public spaces to make the area somewhere people want to live, work and socialise.\nIt’s great to be building for the future whilst protecting our heritage. These industries defined our culture. And when it comes to locally sourced food, we need to protect it. Even if future generations haven’t watched When the Boat Comes In.\nPublished Originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 5.4.21",

In the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing, the memorial crowd spontaneously sang Don’t Look Back in Anger.\nTheresa May’s snap election had looked a certain bet. Then the Labour manifesto was launched. Bold social democratic policies captured the imagination: public ownership of rail, mail, water and energy. Strong on workers’ rights and reversing austerity. From 20 points behind, we were closing rapidly. Then came the attack on the 22nd of May, a suicide bomber murdered 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert, 1,017 others were injured.\nPolitical orthodoxy predicted a “rally round the flag” effect would consolidate the Tory vote and halt Labour’s progress. But Labour defied orthodoxy, and in the spirit of that Manchester crowd, said if you want a peaceful Britain, you have to work for a peaceful world. With 41% of the vote, Labour came close. But not close enough.\nFast forward five years – yes, it’s just five years ago – and hope wears thin. Grenfell, Cambridge Analytica, Windrush, Tommy Robinson, Burqua letter-boxes, “Funny Tinge” Change UK, Farage wins the European elections, Alistair Campbell votes Lib Dem, May resigns, Johnson PM, levelling up promised, Parliament prorogued, Johnson landslide, Keir Starmer’s Ten Pledges, Brexit, Covid ignored, Covid rips through care homes, PPE corruption, Zoom, clap for carers, test & trace massive waste, Andy Burnham & co fight Tiers in the north, bodies pile high in their thousands, Jeremy Corbyn whip removed, vaccine bounce, Hartlepool by-election, Labour proscriptions, Andy McDonald resigns, £20 universal credit cut, COP 26 fails to deliver, number 10 cake ambush, Brexit unravelling, Ukraine invaded, energy hikes, inflation bites, Forde Report, Johnson defenestrated, Truss on the march, rail strikes, Mick Lynch wins the argument, Sam Tarry sacked, unions fighting back, the world is burning.\nNo wonder you’re exhausted. And angry. It sounds like a Billy Joel song.\nYou might have joined Labour with the Corbyn surge of hope. You might have been in Labour all along. The temptation to say “stuff it” and walk away is strong. Some have left the Labour Party. Others have been expelled for innocuous social media likes. But it’s called struggle for a reason. I don’t like Johnson or Truss, but I won’t remove myself from the electoral register. I’ll keep my vote and use it.\nA world where billionaires extract wealth by impoverishing people, then offshore their profits while the planet burns, is unsustainable on any level. The British public agree with us. On a policy-by-policy basis Labour’s 2017 & 2019 manifestos are hugely popular. Survation’s poll this August showed 69% want publicly owned water, vs. 11% who want it privately owned. It’s the same for buses, rail, mail, and energy, to within a couple of percent. You’re in the majority, and you’re on the right side of history.\nThere’s a reason inflation is rampant and poverty is endemic. There’s a reason workers are striking and coordinated industrial action is on the cards. The world is still using the economic model that caused the 2007-8 crash. Debt, speculation and fossil fuels are preferred to investment in people and public infrastructure. Unless that changes, any Government, under any leader, will fail to provide financial security.\nBuilding a better world means challenging the status of the mega-rich. It means challenging the right-wing myths as myths. Reversing privatisation, reversing inequality, and taxing wealth. Eradicating hunger and homelessness for good.\nWe know that paints a target on our backs. There is no route to a Labour victory by appeasing the Murdochs & Rothermeres. Times have changed. Millions are unable to pay their bills. The public back the unions. That 2017 manifesto is even more needed today. Our First Past the Post system means only Labour can deliver it. What stings most is that you saw this coming, and cried out “why is no one listening?”\nOur demands are pragmatic, not dogmatic. I work with businesses every day to create jobs with good pay and conditions. I work with them in our child poverty prevention work, our Green New Deal and tackling the climate crisis. Britain has 5.6 million small business owners. Labour should be pro-business – where businesses are ethical. But strategic infrastructure and services should be in public hands. Surpluses should be reinvested, not extracted for distant shareholders.\nThe UK’s next Prime Minister will be chosen not by the British people, but by 160,000 Tory members. In the last fifty years, there have been ten Labour leaders. Win or lose, there will be another leadership election. And another one after that. And Parliamentary selections. Keep your vote, and use it. In 2015, 2016 and 2020 Labour members chose leaders who promised to renationalise rail, mail, energy and water, end tuition fees, and reverse anti-union legislation. We need you.\nHope fades when change seems impossible. But we’re on a rollercoaster of change. It’s 25 years since the 1997 victory. The 90’s playbook is history. When John Major fought a leadership election in 1995, around 60% of the public said they’d vote Labour. In 1997 we polled 43.2%. Today, Labour has an 80 seat majority to overturn, voter suppression and possible boundary changes to deal with. Whatever the polls say, we need you.\nThe next 25 years will be more unstable than anything since World War 2. The struggle for dignity, equality and prosperity will be fought against a backdrop of climate breakdown, resource shortages, and global instability. We haven’t got time to sit this one out and wait. We need you.\nDon’t look back in anger. Take your inspiration from the Jam: stop apologising for the things you’ve never done; time is short, life is cruel, but it’s up to us to change this Town Called Malice.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_why-do-we-have-a-housing-crisis/content_54.html": "Why Do We Have A Housing Crisis?\nDecember 22, 2018\nPrivate rents are so high that people have in any given year to work from January 1st until 31st May to earn enough to pay the year’s rent. That’s nearly half a year’s hard graft going on rent.\nSince the 1970’s, median wages have pretty much remained at the same level – once you account for inflation. But property prices have rocketed. This chart shows the difference between wages and house prices.\nThroughout the 1970s, Britain’s built 240,000 homes a year, while the population rose by 40,000 a year.\nSince 2000, we’ve only built 140,000 homes a year, despite a population rise of 400,000 a year.\nYet house building is more profitable than ever. Take a look at the accounts of building firms, and you’ll see a 20% profit margin is not unusual.\nTwo strategic housing polices have caused this crisis. Finally, under Jeremy Corbyn, we have a manifesto committed to reversing them.\nFirst is the destruction of social housing. Right to buy was introduced by Margaret Thatcher. It deliberately penalises councils who build council housing. Only three years after building them, councils can be forced to sell them at least 30% below market price, without any compensation from central government. The law prevented councils from using the proceeds of sales to build new houses.\nThe loss of social housing skews the market. With over a million families on waiting lists, and only 290,000 homes available last year,the private rented sector can continue to push rents ever higher. Housing benefit goes straight into thelandlord’s pockets, so where’s the incentive to keep rents affordable? Market forces have failed: the freedom to be homeless is no freedom at all.\nThe second policy causing the crisis is the deliberate financialisation of our economy. Throughout the 50s, 60s and 70s, banks and finance houses made about 5% a year profits, while manufacturing made about 15%returns. From Thatcher onwards, those figures swapped place.\nManufacturing builds real things, and provides large numbers of well paid jobs. Banking makes money from debt. Before the crash, centrist politicians really believed that the housing boom was a genuine economic miracle. The miracle was a mirage, but the centrists still cling to failed economic models.\nMedian house prices may have rocketed, but median wealth hasn’t. All those houses were bought with debt. Some working people were lucky to be born at the right time. They bought when they could afford it, and have made a tidy return. Although much of that equity is lost with social care costs later in life.\nIn a generation no working class people will own property.We’re heading back to the Victorian era, albeit an era with iPhones instead of monocles, but where work is precarious and millions depend on charity to avoid starvation.\nIn 1981 2 million people lived in private rented housing. Now it’s over 5 million and rising fast. We pay over £50 billion a year in rent. All those buy-to-let mortgages are enriching the shareholders of banks. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from the working people to rich asset owners. Private renting is rarely a choice, for most tenants, it’s either that or be homeless.\nWe need a Labour government to change the law on council housing.\nYet there are things councils – and Mayors – can do, even with the powers we have now. But only if politicians seriously believe in democratising wealth. Wringing hands about Tory funding formulas won’t cut the mustard.\nWe can rebuild social housing. Not enough to turn the tide, but enough to create islands of decent, affordable housing for hundreds and thousands of people. That’s my mission.\nHousing cooperatives are exempt from right-to-buy legislation. They are owned by the people, not the state. The new Mayor has powers to set up development corporations.A Mayor who believes in centrism and neoliberal economics could partner with developers, which is mostly what happens now. Developers build the houses for sale, with a few ‘affordable’ ones thrown in. But affordable means costing80% of the other homes in the development. Even 80% of unaffordable is still unaffordable.\nA Mayor like me, who believes in democratic ownership, can partner with cooperatives. We can help them secure low cost capital to buy the land and build the homes. We can provide training and support through adult education on community enterprises,so the tenants learn to self-manage their cooperatives. Instead of paying rent to private landlords,the profits from these community housing coops can fund local services. We can create financially self-sufficient services like gardens and parks, and youth & community work.\nWe can mix Community Housing Coops with Community Land Trusts. This is where the land is owned communally by the residents. People can buy the homes on the land at a lower price than normal. In return, when they come to sell, they share the profits back into the Trust. The legal format creates an asset lock. This means the whole enterprise can never be privatised – it’s always owned communally by the people who live there.\nEven people who can afford a mortgage are working to pay the bank. For every £1 you borrow on a mortgage, you pay back £1.60, even at today’s historically low interest rates. That 60p buys you nothing – and funds bankers’ bonuses and ends up in tax havens like the Cayman Islands.\nWe can tackle this financial drain by creating our own banks. Banks whose legal form requires them to use their profits for the benefit of the community, instead of distant shareholders. These are already happening in Britain; in fact mutuals used to be the standard way of getting a mortgage. It will take a couple of years to go through the regulatory process. Then all those £millions paid in interest can be reinvested in local communities: cooperative nurseries,building repair companies, whatever the community chooses. This makes us independent of central government funding.\nNeoliberal thinking got us into this mess. Only a change in thinking can get us out of it. These policies work – they’re already happening across our country, in a small way, with solid results. The task is to accelerate them and scale them up. That takes a Mayor who believes in socialism and always has.\nWhen I interviewed John McDonnell this summer, he spoke of an irreversible shift in wealth and power. He said that for real socialists, not centrists, the whole point of getting power is to give it away to the people. That’s what I’m going to do if you elect me as Mayor.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_can-we-fix-our-broken-transport-system-yes-we-can/content_179.html": "Can we fix our broken transport system? Yes we can!\nAugust 13, 2023\nYou wait ages for a bus and two turn up once. Although these days you’ll be lucky if a bus turns up at all. Since 2010 England has lost half its bus routes – down from 17,394 to 8,781.\nThat statistic hides the towns and villages cut off from public transport. The jobs and courses people can’t get to. The second hand cars people are borrowing money to buy because there’s no bus service.\nPlenty of European counties have clean, efficient, affordable public transport. A series of poor political decisions has undermined Britain’s. In 1985, while undermining North East industry, Margaret Thatcher found time to introduce the Transport Act. It deregulated bus services outside of London – not in London, mind. It created a wild west where bus operators compete on core routes while quieter routes wither.\nAn economist would call it market failure. If a transport network has big gaps, people can’t get end-to-end journeys, and so don’t use public transport at all. The long term effect is a year-on-year reduction in passenger numbers. Public transport becomes an afterthought when planning new shopping centres and housing developments.\n65% of people think buses should be publicly owned. I agree. In fact, they already are. Just not by the British public. Our largest bus company Arriva, headquartered in Sunderland, is owned by Deutsche Bahn – owned by the German public. If you take the 306 to the coast or the 553 to the Freeman Hospital, your fare is subsidising the German rail network. I’m all for Germans having good public transport. I just don’t think we should pay for it.\nIn the North East alone, bus companies extract £30.7 million a year to pay shareholders. That could be reinvested in better services and electric vehicles.\nI should declare an interest – I don’t own a car. I get around by bike, train, metro and bus. I think our public transport system would be better run if more politicians actually used it.\nBut I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. When I studied engineering at Northumbria University in the nineties, I wrote a whole paper on what future integrated public transport could look like. Thirty years on and we’ve gone backwards. So how do we fix it?\nIn my 2019 manifesto I said I’d negotiate to bring the whole region into one Mayoral Combined Authority to get transport devolved. Well, we’ve done that. And got £4.3 billion with it.\nIf I’m elected North East Mayor, I’ll build a Total Transport Network – fully integrated public transport under public control. With free travel for all young people under 18.\nFrom May next year we’ll have the power to bring buses back under public control. It’s not a magic bullet, mind. We still have to pay for it, and if mismanaged, the council tax payer foots the bill. I’ve not charged you a penny in council tax as North of Tyne Mayor, and I don’t intend to start now.\nA better system means more passengers, so more revenue. A single intelligent network covering the North East from Berwick to Barnard Castle. Where every bus has a transponder so passengers can see its location on an app, in real time, and be sure it’s coming. Where we use that data for continuous improvement.\nWhere traffic hotspots have bus gates – so when the bus approaches, the traffic lights change and give it priority while the cars wait. Faster buses means fewer cars on the roads. So a plumber with a van full of tools or a doctor on call can spend their time doing their job instead of sitting in traffic.\nJoined-up on demand buses in rural areas to connect everyone, whether they drive or not. Reservable bike lockers in town centres so you’re not worried about theft.\nA single account keyed to your smartphone or smartcard that automatically charges you the lowest fare. So once you’ve hit a price cap, you get unlimited travel for free, whether you switch between bus, Metro, National Rail, or e-scooter.\nI was an engineer long before I became a politician – fixing broken systems is what I do. As one famous cartoon builder said, “Can we fix it? Yes we can!”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_understanding-the-emotion-of-betrayal/content_119.html": "Understanding the Emotion of Betrayal\nApril 14, 2020\nThere are nine layers of Hell in Dante’s Inferno. The first is for those who were not baptised. The second for those who committed the sins of lust. Third, gluttony. Fourth, avarice. Fifth, anger. Sixth, blasphemy. Seventh, violence. Eight, deceivers and liars. The ninth and final circle of Hell is reserved for traitors. After making his way past Cain, who slew his brother, Abel, after passing Brutus who stabbed his friend and mentor Caesar, Dante describes Judas Iscariot. Frozen in ice, his head gnawed in the jaws of Satan, the flesh from his back scourged by Satan’s talons for all eternity.\nI’m not religious, and I don’t believe in the supernatural. But Dante’s work was a stinging satire on the politics of his day. His identification of treachery as the most viscerally despised of all behaviours speaks to a universal truth. It’s hard to describe the special kind of anger that betrayal invokes.\nThe leaked release of the Labour Anti-Semitism report describes just such a betrayal. The 851 page report cites a vast amount of primary source material. It is utterly damning. Abusive insults. Claiming the membership is mentally ill. Hyper factionalism, conspiracy. Dirty tricks and factional politicking doesn’t cover this. It’s an absolute and total betrayal of every decent quality and every value the Labour movement stands for.\nThe deliberate derailing of disciplinary cases of racism and Anti-Semitism to undermine the Party and its leader. Senior Labour Party staff actively working to lose the 2017 General Election. Let that sink in. The report details the people who were paid to run the Party deliberately sabotaging our election campaign. They put the Tories into power. They didn’t just betray the Labour membership. Every council worker whose job has been cut, every Universal Credit claimant waiting weeks for money, every person struggling to pay their bills in the gig economy. They betrayed them all. And blamed it on Jeremy Corbyn and the wider Party membership.\nWe don’t need an inquiry into why the report was published, or how it found its way into the public. The case has been made in its quarter of a million words. The accusations stand in need of answer. All those who stand accused must be brought up on charges. They should get a fair hearing, with representation. But we must know the truth. Those who are found to have betrayed their comrades, their employer and their movement must face expulsion. This should not be a kangaroo court. It must be done by the book. We can only have unity by ensuring that justice is carried out with full transparency. The role of an inquiry must be to see where this stops.\nWhatever the result, my job is campaigning for socialism. I ask anyone who shares my politics to stay in the Party with me and fight the good fight. I will continue to build the grassroots, I’ll work as an elected representative, and I’ll strive to change the world to a place that reflects the Labour values of compassion, fairness, equality and solidarity.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_a-green-new-deal-for-all/content_197.html": "A Green New Deal For All\nSeptember 28, 2020\nUnemployment is the worst of the economic scourges. Pundits obsess about debt-to-GDP ratio, interest rates, inflation targets, and trade imbalances. But it’s unemployment that fuels anxiety, crushes mental health and lays waste to communities.\nHaving citizens unable to earn a living is a blight on prosperity. So Rishi Sunak was right to take action. But millions have lost their jobs, and his decision to cancel the budget means he’s not creating any new ones.\nLet’s look at his Job Support Scheme. Suppose your normal salary is £20,800, or £400 a week. You come back part time, and get up to 77% of your pay (a 23% pay cut). So now you get £308, a loss of £92 per week. If you only have to pay 77% of your rent or mortgage, and the supermarkets only charge you for 77% of your food that’s fine. As long as your kids only need 77% of the clothes they grow out of, and your energy supplier gives you a 23% discount.\nThere are millions that Rishi’s Scheme won’t help. Anyone who worked in a cinema, a theatre or a night club. All those who worked two or three jobs to make ends meet. The millions of freelancers in arts and entertainment. Self-employed musicians and people who worked on turnstiles on a Saturday. When the state says “you must close your business”, it has a moral duty to provide an alternative to bankruptcy.\nUnemployment is deep seated in the UK, and disguised by many names. Zero hours contracts. Bogus self-employment. Working Tax Credit is a symptom of an economy that cannot provide enough well-paid work to keep people’s heads above water.\nRishi Sunak’s ideology is showing. Just like giving £10 billion to inexperienced private firms to run a failing test and trace system, he’s relying on the market to create the new economy.\nFree market capitalists believe that money is king, and the market will solve every problem. That the birth of the new is worth the pain and a certain mortality rate of jobs. Democratic socialists believe the state is the midwife for its citizens. That no one should be abandoned. That we should devolve decision making and empower people to build their own futures.\nThe economy has shifted. Millions of people will never again work full-time in offices. Whole sectors cannot operate. Internet shopping is affecting High Streets.\nRishi’s had seven months since the first Covid support was announced in the March budget. You can’t keep treating a broken leg with sticking plasters and pain killers. Sooner or later you have to set the bone so it can heal properly.\nThis is the perfect time for a Green New Deal.\nWe have millions who live in fuel poverty. We know that insulating homes saves people hundreds on their fuel bills, and saves the NHS a fortune in ill health. So why aren’t we launching a massive programme of retrofitting homes? It pays for itself over time.\nWe know our transport system is dysfunctional. Those without cars are unable to easily access work or education. Those with cars are trapped in congestion and air pollution. If Rishi gave us the power to use Land Value Capture, we could fund our own Metro and rail extensions now. They pay for themselves by increasing the value of the land around them. Everyone says they want to end land banking, so let’s do it.\nWe know our start-up companies need investment, not just debt. Other countries have a Sovereign Wealth Fund to support their people. We need a Regional Wealth Fund to invest in start-ups and local small businesses. We can shape our economy and reward firms who look after their staff and work sustainably.\nWe know the world needs an energy system that’s not dependent on oil or gas. We can install enough wind turbines in the North Sea to power the whole of Western Europe, and earn money from exports. If Rishi just enforced the existing rules that all wind turbines in British waters must have at least 60% British content, it would create 9000 jobs along the Tyne immediately. Think of all those well paid jobs in engineering. All the young men and women who could get apprenticeships and a secure future.\nAs a cabinet, the North of Tyne all know that supporting jobs is urgent. But the real task is creating a new, sustainable economy. I’ve asked the government for all the components for a Green New Deal. Our submission to the Comprehensive Spending Review understands the fact that there’s no conflict between sustainable public finances, a clean environment, and a secure future for our people. Warm housing, reliable transport, better health, and above all, a secure job for everyone who needs one.\nPublished Originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 28.9.20",

She was asked, as a result of crashing the economy “will you cut public services?” Her words dodged the question. But she blinked 70 times in 35 seconds. Ms Truss lacks credibility in pretty much every way possible. With non-verbal signals like that, no wonder she struggled to negotiate trade deals as Foreign Secretary. Even her own eyelids don’t believe her.\nShe won’t last. Michael Gove immediately came out and stuck the knife in, decrying “the sheer risk of using borrowed money to fund tax cuts. That is not Conservative.”\nThere was a sense of belief and confidence at Labour Conference last week. Much has been made of Labour’s 33 point lead in a YouGov. I’m not convinced the margin is that high. Survation has called every election in recent years, accurate to within 1%. They put Labour 21% ahead, picking up votes not just from the Tories, but also the Greens. Labour’s commitment to clean energy will have helped.\nThe Tory collapse gives me no sense of joy. I would prefer a competent government that isn’t wrecking the livelihoods and businesses of Britain. I’d prefer to win on better polices, not the personal failings of lying about Covid parties.\nI recall Billy Bragg saying in a concert at the Sage, Gateshead, that as a young man, he didn’t vote in 1979. He couldn’t see any difference between Jim Callaghan and Maggie Thatcher. And how he regrets it.\nBut a clear gap is opening up.\nOn climate, Labour will invest in clean energy, so 100% of our electricity is fossil fuel free by 2030. Plus massive investment in insulation and low-carbon heating systems. The Conservatives want to restart fracking.\nOn energy, Labour will set up publicly owned Great British Energy to guarantee security of supply. The Conservatives will write Vladimir Putin a strongly worded letter. And possibly return the donations Russian billionaires gave them. Or possibly not.\nOn working conditions, Labour’s New Deal for Working people outlaws fire-and-rehire and zero-hours contracts. It guarantees sick-pay and holiday rights from day one. The Truss Conservatives want to force workers to work even if they’ve legally balloted for strike action.\nOn rail, Labour will nationalise the railways, ending the chaotic franchising system. The Conservatives think privatisation works fine. So long as workers accept pay cuts.\nOn buses, Labour will allow public control of bus companies. The Conservatives still think the free market is king.\nOn cost of living, both parties would cap the price of energy. Labour would fund it by taxing the excess profits of energy giants. The Conservatives are funding it by taxing you. That’s right – their “price cap” is being funded by borrowing, which means we, the people, carry the debt. It will come from reducing our public services, as Ms Truss blinking well confirmed.\nOn justice, Labour will bring in a Hillsborough Law, requiring a legal duty of candour and disclosure from all public officials. Families in any tragedy or injustice will be able to get to the truth. The Conservatives have brought in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Protesters can be arrested if their protest has an impact. What’s the point of a protest that doesn’t have an impact?!\nThe worst part of it, the Truss-Kwarteng “growth” plan won’t work. The UK is awash with money in asset management funds. Tax cuts aren’t needed. What we are short of are investable propositions. The reason we’ve created so many well-paid jobs in the North of Tyne is by working closely with businesses and people. We match businesses directly to investment. We work with residents to get them the training they need. It’s remarkable we’ve achieved the results we have: 12 years of austerity has left us an under-skilled workforce, devastating health inequalities and obsolete infrastructure.\nThe public mood has changed. I spoke at the Enough is Enough rally in Newcastle on Saturday. 1500 people assembled at the Monument. Ms Truss may be in a political death spiral, but a General Election could be as late as January 2025. The foodbanks could run out of food before then. It’s time for a mass movement of protest. Enough is Enough.",

Gentle exercise, catching some sunshine, and of course, talking with the public.\nAn unexpected benefit is seeing the vast diversity of front gardens. From manicured lawns and colourful tulips, to weeds and piles of rubble. I’ve concluded, in a totally unscientific way, that there’s a correlation between how neat someone’s garden is, and how likely they are to vote.\nPolitical parties can get a copy of the electoral register, marked with whether people voted in each election. How they voted is secret, of course. But from talking to people, there is no correlation between how tidy someone’s garden is and who they say they’ll vote for.\nPeople do curious things for status. One person told me that since her husband was now a high earner, she was thinking of switching from Labour to Conservative. Status, like fashion, is about emulating people you want to be associated with.\n“Do you really see yourself being like Boris Johnson and the Conservatives?” I asked. I left unspoken the record of tax dodging, law breaking and contracts for their mates. She didn’t. Like me, she wanted people in charge who’d create a safe place for her kids to grow up. This was just before Tory MP Neil Parish was caught watching pornography on his phone in the House of Commons.\nI’ve said before that I don’t believe all Labour politicians are saints, and all Tories are sinners. We all know that any group can have a rogue member. What angers people is the covering up and closing ranks.\nIt’s a pattern of behaviour. Tory Whips did nothing about Neil Parish for days after it was reported. Priti Patel’s bullying. Boris Johnson’s law breaking. Not one, but two Tory Chancellors – Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak – have benefited from non-dom tax avoidance. They seem to base their moral response on whether they’re getting bad headlines. This is low status. Any truly upstanding citizen would condemn it.\nOne Tory voter told me that although sleaze was a problem, Mr Johnson had led the country well through the pandemic. I didn’t ask which newspaper she reads.\nI mentioned that I was North of Tyne Mayor, and had many meetings with government ministers. That we didn’t know what government policy was from one day to the next. Like in January last year, when the PM said on Sunday morning that schools would definitely stay open. And on the Monday, he closed them. That he missed five COBRA meetings in a row because he was writing a book about Shakespeare, because he needed the money. And said he’d rather “let the bodies pile high in their thousands” than have another lockdown. And then had another lockdown anyway, but only after the bodies had piled high in their thousands.\nShe remembered all those events. By chance, she had just picked up her postal vote off the doormat, and had it in her hand. “You’ve convinced me,” she said. “I’ll fill it now.”\n“But the council haven’t cut the grass,” or equivalent statement crops up a lot. Local councils get blamed for underfunded services. The PM keeps repeating untrue statements at Prime Ministers Questions. Even if a known liar says something, people of good faith still think it might be true. So let’s check the facts.\nIn the last decade, the Conservative government has taken £413 per person per year from councils in the North of England. So says IPPR’s State of the North report. £413 cuts a lot of grass.\nFullFact.org shows that average council tax per household is £1,256 for Labour run councils, £1,592 for Conservatives, and £1,700 for Lib Dems.\nThe most typical response in a doorstep conversation is “I don’t know which way I’ll vote.” Politics, at its heart, should be about a social contract. What do we expect of our citizens, and what do we want our government to prioritise? Instead, British politics has sunk into a grotesque reality TV show.\nOnly 1 in 3 people vote in local elections. Do we want a country run by someone whose only interest – and only skill – is self-preservation? If you want better politics, and better politicians, please vote on Thursday.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 2 May 22",

Perhaps it’s wrestling back some work-life balance, returning to that hobby you did when you were younger. If that’s the only part of your life out of control, you’re not doing too badly.\nI see too many people trying to take back control of their finances. One in three working families are a single paycheque away from not paying their rent or mortgage.\nSocial isolation is at record levels. For millions, taking back control of their mental health is a distant dream. Those trapped in abusive relationships. Victims of persistent racial abuse. For them, even hope itself can be hard to imagine.\nAny clinical psychologist will tell you that feeling powerless is toxic for your mental health. The sense of not having control over what is happening to you.\nIf & when we leave the EU, there’s going to be a lot of people wondering why they still feel out of control. Because, if we’re talking politics, “take back control” is an illusion. How can you take back something that was never yours?\nBillionaires can take back control. S*n owner Rupert Murdoch and Daily Mail owner Viscount Rothermere are champing at the bit. They back Johnson & Farage’s low-wage low-regulation agenda with their low-fact newspapers. Should foreign domiciled tax avoiders have that much control?\nIn fact, since when have people of ordinary means ever had control over our economy? In or out of the EU, could you fund a dubious think-tank to deny climate change? When bankers rigged the rates and crashed our economy, they got bailed out, and kept their bonuses. But if you lose your job, or your small business fails, who will bail you out, and maintain your standard of living? Could you take advantage of the “freedom” to buy the NHS? The Johnson-Farage agenda is about ordinary people losing control.\nThe question that doesn’t get asked in the TV debates is: who is the economy for?\nI wrote last week about the Glendale Trust in Wooler. They own flats, shops, a community hub and a youth hostel. Their commercial operations pay for themselves, and keep their community vibrant. It keeps money recirculating in the local economy. It gives young families a chance to live near where they grew up. It tackles one of our greatest social problems at its root – people not feeling part of a community.\nThe People’s Powerhouse met in Sunderland this week. It’s a growing coalition of groups who think Northern communities should be at the heart of the Northern Powerhouse. Too much of our future is decided in London.\nCouncil leader Graham Miller and I were both there. We share a vision of community wealth building. We need a focus on developing small, local enterprises, owned and run by local people. I’m working with organisations like Power To Change and the National Lottery to roll out a series of pilot projects. A democratic economy is a more resilient economy.\nThere’s strength in our communities. People want them to thrive. The missing ingredient is often a bit of specialist support. An accountant or lawyer to help with the set-up, a worker to get things up and running.\nTake Second Bite as an example. It’s a catering academy based at the Cedarwood Trust in the Meadow Well estate. It’s also a social enterprise. People trying to turn their lives around from substance misuse struggle to get back into paid work. Second Bite gives them training and work experience, and crucially, self esteem by feeding people in food poverty. It enables them to start to take control over their own lives, often for the first time. Hedge funds would never invest in this, but local communities do. And it makes a difference.\nBuilding a rich network of community hubs so everyone gets a foot on the ladder. That’s what taking back control really looks like.\nThis article was first published in The Journal and The Chronicle on Monday 25th November 2019",

The train I was working on went over a damaged line at more than 100mph and it shattered beneath us, hurling everyone everywhere. As the train split, I was flung around like a rag doll, desperately trying to find something to hold on to. I’ll never forget those terrifying minutes,” writes a rail worker who now works in an LNER ticket office.\nFour people died needlessly that day because proper maintenance had not been carried out. The laws of physics make no distinction between staff and passengers. Cuts to safety endanger everyone.\nThe RMT has stated they want to negotiate a deal with the employers. They’re not even asking for a real pay rise – they’re just asking for pay to keep pace with inflation. A deal would also involve working conditions, the right to time off, protection from compulsory redundancy, and proper training standards. But government won’t let the employers settle.\nNetwork Rail hasn’t raised pay since 2019. Staff shortages are rife, low pay will make it worse. We’ve got one of the safest railways in Europe – for now. But it could quickly become one of the most dangerous. Network Rail’s plans would pay some safety-critical staff about £22,000, including nights and unsocial work, and using their own vehicles and fuel to reach different sites they’d have to work at.\nThe train operating companies (TOCs) are all private companies, although around 70% of them are owned in part or in full by foreign governments. The rail industry makes £100’s of millions in profits. I’m pleased that German passengers have a good rail system. I just don’t think our ticket-buyers and underpaid workers should pay for it.\nI’ve been saying for years that Britain needs to be a high-wage, high-skill economy. Last year, the Prime Minister said the same thing. I’m not a Professor of Logic at Oxford University, but I reckon a high-wage economy means paying people high wages.\nStrip out the erosion of workplace pensions, and real wages – what you can buy after inflation – have fallen in the UK over the past fifteen years. They’re now being gobbled up by unchecked inflation. Yet the UK’s top ten billionaires’ wealth has increased from £48 billion in 2009 to £182 billion in 2022. An increase of 281%. It’s time for a wealth tax.\nWage claims follow inflation, they don’t cause it. 58.7% of the current inflation spike is caused by profiteering. 8.3% from increased labour costs – and that’s mainly staff shortages. The rest is supply chain disruption.\nSo that’s the economics. But what about the morality?\nThe tired old media lines of yesteryear have been wheeled out to attack workers defending their livelihoods. “Union barons” “ordering 40,000 members to down tools” “causing misery”. Tory MPs blaming rail workers for delays to NHS treatment is pure gaslighting.\nIt’s a democratic ballot. When unions strike, they give four weeks’ notice of a ballot and two weeks’ notice of the strike. I sit on the Transport for the North Committee, and the Rail North Committee. We’ve told government for years that the system is crumbling. All they have to do to stop the strikes is turn up and negotiate.\nStrikes are not the weapons of billionaires. Or the people who make the laws. Who give £millions to their mates in dodgy PPE deals. Who have offshore bank accounts. Strikes are the weapon of last resort for working people seeing their real wages fall and the safety and sustainability of their industry crumbling before their eyes. It’s the railways now. But teachers, NHS workers, postal workers, airport check-in staff, telecoms engineers, and even criminal barristers are actively considering industrial action.\nMinisters were quick to publish videos of themselves clapping for carers on Thursday nights through lockdown. Now it’s time to reward the people who do the work in our country.\nWhen billionaires want to advance their agenda, they do it through the newspapers they own. If no one is listening to workers, industrial action is their only tool to protect their livelihoods and our public services. I stand with the RMT and so should the Labour Party.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 27 June 22",

The people are friendly and hard working. The landscape is beautiful, our heritage impressive. We have world-leading industries. But let’s not sugar-coat the truth. Our productivity is too low, and our healthy life expectancy is the worst in England. Widespread deprivation goes hand-in-hand with the lowest levels of asset ownership.\nThe reason is simple: long-term under-investment. Investment in businesses, investment in infrastructure, and investment in our people. This is what devolution must fix. Our region needs investment, and productive people. People are only productive, in the sense of a modern economy, when they are happy, healthy, and have the skills to contribute. Everything else flows from this. The solution is to make the North East a powerhouse of wealth generation.\nI have been making the case that the investment is already there to be found. The remaining ingredient is political will. I’m standing ready to make the North East an economic powerhouse. This is about breaking the mindset that the North is inevitably poor. I’m not asking for fish. I’m asking for a fishing rod.\nThe answers to the economic problems of the North East lie in generating more wealth here. This will result in a virtuous circle of reducing health and skills inequalities which, in turn, will lead to greater prosperity.\nBut wealth generation depends upon the freedom to innovate. This should not be limited to the private sector. Whole swathes of services and infrastructure are run or administered by local, regional, and national government. Too often, they don’t coordinate well. Funding mechanisms and convoluted lines of accountability disincentivise both long-term strategic action, and agile innovation. You cannot level up the North from Whitehall.\nNor can regional economic inequality be addressed by raising taxes locally. The unevenness of the tax base would just exacerbate the inequality.\nMayoral combined authorities would gain these fiscal mechanisms:\nThis is a win-win. It pays for itself. It creates incentives for stronger regional leadership. It grows the national income. It reduces pressure on public services. And it improves the lives of our citizens.",

People looking for a single reason to explain the behaviour of 32 million voters. It was the media. It was Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn was too peacenik. Boris was a lovable rogue.\nLet’s start with the most basic fact. Boris Johnson is Prime Minister.\nHe has a heavy responsibility. I hope he’s up to the task of guiding us out of the EU without crashing our economy. So far we’ve only seen the withdrawal bill. There will be a trading relationship with Europe, and the details have to be worked out. I’ve not yet seen any economic analysis that shows where greater prosperity comes from.\nI hope he does well. I mean that. Because if you believe in democracy, as I do, you have to respect a mandate.\nI hope he’ll live up to his promises to devolve power and budgets to democratically elected Mayors, who have our own mandates. Taking back control means making decisions in the North East, not in Whitehall.\nI hope he’ll do a better job as Prime Minister than he did as Foreign Secretary. If Britain’s striking out on our own, we cannot afford those kinds of gaffes.\nI worry about the threats made against the BBC and Channel 4, when they criticised him. We need diversity in our media. Eighty percent of the British press is owned by a handful of tax-exiles who don’t live in Britain.\nI worry about the scale of cuts our councils face. Their finances are already unsustainable. I worry that Johnson will transfer even more of the burden onto council tax payers. Global corporations like Amazons and Starbucks must pay their share.\n14 million people voted Conservative. 18 million voted for other parties. However you slice it, there’s a case for proportional representation.\nFewer people voted for Johnson in 2019 than for John Major in April 1992, despite the increase in population. In September 1992, Sterling crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. Labour took a 20 point poll lead. John Smith was on track for a 1997 landslide before his tragic death. Tony Blair took over and won with a 12.5% margin. Tory support only recovered after the 2008 financial crash.\nThere’s much talk about who’ll be the next Labour leader.\nAll politicians get attacked by the media, most of it is unjustified. According to the press, Ed Miliband couldn’t eat a bacon sandwich. Gordon Brown was miserable. Tony Blair was labelled a liar even before the Iraq war. With Jeremy Corbyn, the vilification stuck. A long history of campaigning for peace and against oppression gave the tabloid press their targets. Labour’s nuanced stance on Brexit reinforced the negative image.\nUnder Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership Labour polled more votes, with a higher share of the electorate, than under Ed Miliband in 2015, Gordon Brown in 2010, or Tony Blair in 2005. I don’t ascribe that to Jeremy personally. All my conversations with voters convince me it’s our policies that are popular. Every poll confirms it.\nI want to see a government prioritise wellbeing for everybody, weighted towards those most in need. I want to see a government support small businesses and see they get paid on time. I want a government that will tackle racism and bigotry. That reverses the crippling poverty ruining the life chances of kids born to poor parents. That ends the epidemic of poor mental health. That sees low pay and homelessness a thing of the past. That unleashes the talents and creativity of millions of our fellow citizens. That recognises an economy based on financial speculation is not good enough. We need one based on a green industrial transformation.\nI’ll support a leadership candidate who offers that hope.\nI don’t believe that’s what we’ve got with Boris Johnson. I’d be delighted to be proven wrong.\nIn the meantime, I’ll be delivering my manifesto as Mayor.\nThis article was first published in the Journal and the Chronicle on Monday 16th December 2019",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_what-makes-me-tick/content_34.html": "What makes me tick?\nMarch 17, 2024\nI shared a bedroom with two brothers. My sister, older than us, got her own room. One afternoon when I was about six years old I was lying on my bottom bunk drawing a picture. A searing wave of pain shot through me. I started screaming. My older brother had shot me on the backside with a .177 air pistol from six feet. “Accidentally,” he claimed.\nNot long after that I was watching him pass out from his naval basic training at HMS Rayleigh in Plymouth. A couple of years later was the Falklands War. Thankfully he was safe. That’s families. Arguing one minute, proud of each other the next.\nWherever we grew up, our perspective is normal for us. We can’t see our blindspots. I’ve been asked a few times recently about my background, and what make me tick.\nBefore working at ICI, my Dad was a tank driver in the army. He believed in keeping your word, fulfilling your obligations, and not drawing attention to yourself.\nMy Mam was, and still is, a molten ball of moral courage. I’ve always prized bravery as one of the highest virtues. She set up the Refuge from domestic violence in Middlesbrough. Despite having four kids at home, she commuted an hour and a half each way to Sunderland to get a diploma in Youth & Community work. She became the union branch chair. She always aimed to take people with her. Fight if you have to, but try diplomacy first.\nI remember her taking me to the Durham Miners’ Gala, pointing up at balcony on the County Hotel. I had no idea who those politicians and union leaders were. She took me on the first Reclaim the Night march in Leeds in 1977 as a young boy. It was an all women march. I grew up assuming it was normal to stand up to injustice.\nAt age 11, my Dad was one of many laid off by ICI. With his redundancy, we moved across Middlesbrough. Teesville where we’d come from was pretty rough. Hemlington was rougher. One day after school six lads from a different school attacked me in an alley. I’ll never know why. Younger, smaller, and hopelessly outnumbered, I was quickly on the floor, getting kicked and stamped on. I arrived home covered in blood, and needed stitches. After that, I took up martial arts.\nThe new school had a good number of kids from the Pakistani community, including soon, my new best mate, Zahed. I had not realised until then that everyone in my previous school was white. There were certainly lots of things that were insensitive and ignorant, including from teachers. But I never witnessed anything akin to racial hatred, or even intolerance. I don’t believe racism is natural or inevitable. It comes from incitement.\nI left school at 16 and started working at a plumbing factory on Skippers Lane. The blokes got one of the apprentices to go to Jewson’s next door with an order for “Qty: 1, long stand”. It’s an old classic, but the poor lad fell for it.\nIt’s funny what sticks with you. Not long after I started, there were redundancies. Sid worked in the warehouse, manual handling. In his mid to late 50s. “I’ve got irons in the fire, Jamie, don’t worry!” he told me one night walking home from work. There was a shaky defiance in his voice, born of pride.\nI saw him again a few weeks later. “Those irons never came to anything,” he told me, his eyes downbeat. Pride replaced with fear of the future.\nFast forward a few years, and I started an engineering degree at Northumbria University. Despite never having A-levels, I got on a foundation course on the strength of my O-levels.\nI loved engineering, and university. This was before tuition fees. I was in my 20s, and if I’d had to take on debt, I wouldn’t have gone. Educating people is a public good – we should not be saddling young people with debt for being educated. I worked as a night club bouncer to pay my way through. I worked out that Netto on Shields Road sold the cheapest pasta and battery eggs anywhere. It was the only way to make £5 stretch a fortnight.\nDuring these years, Stephen Lawrence was murdered in London. The subsequent inquiry showed institutional failings. On Tyneside, I was involved in the anti-racist movement. Some public campaigning. But mostly behind the scenes. One family in Washington were being harassed by local thugs. Things posted through their letterbox. We’d take turns to sleep on their sofa so they had some peace of mind.\nOne night at a jiu jitsu class in Eldon Square, I looked up and there was a new starter. Athletic, confident, and radiating energy. Turns out she’d done martial arts since she was 11, and she was awesome. It was love at first fight!\nCaroline graduated medicine the same time I got my engineering degree, and we bought a house together. That was possible in the 90s. Today, young people are priced out. After a few years working as an engineer, I switched to developing the software that runs factories and plans production, and ran my own business.\nWhen we had kids, Caroline wanted to develop her career. She was an NHS GP by now, working in Gateshead. Our finances made it possible for me to stay at home with the kids. In a better world, more families would have the money to do this. I kept on teaching jiu jitsu, and also ran an economics reading group. Looking after my boys is the best job I’ve ever had.\nI never intended to be Mayor. When the North of Tyne was created, I encouraged a lot of people to run. They all said no, it wasn’t for them. One Sunday morning the phone went: “We’ve got together last night and decided you have to stop telling other people and do it yourself.”\nOne thing I see a lot in politicians is imposter syndrome. That feeling of being out of your depth. You can tell when a politician is flim-flamming. They talk in clichés and platitudes instead of plans and evidence. Maybe it’s my engineering background, maybe it’s because I do my homework, but I like being asked to explain the detail. The questions I struggle with are, “who would you want to be trapped on a desert island with?” I don’t want to be trapped on a desert island! I have no strong opinions on Strictly!\nI guess my point is people are complex. We’re each a mixture of our circumstances and our choices. We can shape our futures – a bit. John Lennon put it best, “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.”\nWe all have blind spots. Listening to other people helps fill the gaps in our understanding. Especially listening to those with the quietest voices.\nSome years back we were waiting to cross the road. The lights were on red, and a young lad was revving his motorbike. And revving it. And revving it. I was cursing under my breath. Leon, our older son, about 10 years old, was in front of me, holding my Mam’s hand. “Grandma,” he said, “all his life nobody has listened to that young man. That’s why he’s making so much noise now.”",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_theres-nothing-ideological-about-it-its-simple-arithmetic/content_271.html": "There’s Nothing Ideological About It, It’s Simple Arithmetic\nJanuary 15, 2023\nYou get offered a job in modern Britain. A job doing vital, meaningful work. You’ll keep the country running. You’ll make a real difference to people’s lives. You might even save lives. Without you and your colleagues Britain would unravel. Government ministers are so grateful that they film themselves clapping for you on a Thursday evening through the pandemic. Interested?\nThere’s just one catch… every year, you’ll be paid less. Your wages won’t keep up with the rampant inflation gripping our country. Your bills will increase. Food prices will rise. Fuel costs will rocket. But your income will flatline.\nI said there was one catch. But there’s more. You take the job, but colleagues keep leaving. Others are going off sick with stress. There’s more and more work for you now. You get more and more tired. You see your family less and less. It gets so bad that your canteen starts offering free porridge because your teammates can’t afford breakfast. (No, I didn’t make this up. Yes, this has really happened.)\nYou hear about staff sleeping in their cars because they’re exhausted and can’t afford the petrol for the ride home. (Welcome to nursing!) Or your bosses expect you to drive all over the country, whatever hour you’re called out, but won’t reimburse you when you’re haemorrhaging money by filling up your car at the pumps. (Welcome to the rail industry!) And still your pay falls. Eventually, you and your colleagues come together and agree. Enough is enough.\nBut here’s the thing: the Government doesn’t think you should have the right to ask for more. They enforce restrictions to stop you. Ballots for industrial action must involve putting slips of paper in a physical box. (No, I didn’t make this up, either.) It’s 2023, you say. Everything – everything – is online now. Tough, they reply. Paper and box or we’ll prosecute.\nBut enough is enough – ballot thresholds were smashed. But instead of negotiating, Government changes the rules again. There’s no headline in industrial harmony. No red meat for the backbenchers. Besides, it would draw attention to the profits being extracted from our public services. And how much of it get channelled through tax havens.\nSo they bring in anti-strike laws. If Sunak and Co.’s new legislation doesn’t scare you, think of it this way. The Government wants to legally compel people to work against their will. There’s a word for that: conscription. It sounds like something from Putin’s Russia. This is the same Government that said disrupting deliveries of the Daily Telegraph was an act of terrorism.\nIn fact under the international Forced Labour Convention no. 29, forced labour is defined as “work or service which is extracted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily”. It must not be used “as a means of labour discipline” or “punishment for participation in strikes.” That was adopted into UK law in the 2015 Modern Slavery Act.\nIt’s not the strikes causing our services to fail. It’s our failing services causing the strikes – neglected and deprived of investment for years.\nKey workers aren’t demanding ‘a pay rise’. They’re trying to reduce their pay cuts – as inflation eats away their wages. There’s nothing ideological about it – it’s simple arithmetic.\nAnd we’re not talking about a few rogue employees here. You’ll hear commentators asking “do the public support the strikes?” I’d point out: 100,000 nurses, 100,000 posties, 70,000 university staff, 40,000 rail workers, 100,000 civil servants, thousands of ambulance staff all taking action, hundreds of 1000s of teachers being balloted – that is the public!\nThe trade unions are protecting the wages and conditions of all workers. They set the benchmark. Even if you’re not in a union, they help you. So join a union, and help them back.\nSo… this is work in modern Britain. Interested? No? You’re not alone. That’s why there’s a recruitment crisis. The question that commentators never seem to ask is why has it fallen on working people to defend our public services? Isn’t that the Government’s job?\nIf it were up to me, I’d be out clapping for our trade union members on a Thursday evening.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_track-and-trace-the-corruption/content_204.html": "Track and Trace the Corruption\nSeptember 15, 2020\nHow would you feel if someone broke the law, took £480 of your money, and spent it secretly?\nIn under six months, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings have spent £10 billion on Test & Trace and £15 billion on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). That’s a staggering sum. It’s £480 per UK adult.\nHanbury Strategy is a PR firm co-founded by one of Dominic Cummings’ mates. They got £900,000 for research into behaviour linked to the pandemic. That’s enough to fund North of Tyne’s entire digital exclusion programme, that got disadvantaged kids the equipment they needed for online schooling through the lockdown.\nTory-linked PR firm, Topham Guerin were awarded £3 million. That would go a long way to keeping our North of Tyne community and voluntary sector going.\nThey gave a £108 million PPE contract go to a firm with just £18,000 of assets. Another contract for £108 million went to a confectionary wholesaler.\nThere was no evaluation of competitive tenders. They were just handed the cash. I bet you wish you had mates who would give you the odd million quid contract here and there.\nMy job puts me in contact with business leaders, CEOs, public officials, financial journalists. They tell me this government is now a by-word for incompetence. Mass deaths in care homes, exam fiascos, PPE masks that don’t work, lockdown rules flouted. Millions of self-employed still excluded from financial support. Food parcels sent to people shielding, full of banana-flavoured Angel Delight.\nWe’ve now added corruption to incompetence. The test and trace system has been a mess ever since the Conservatives decided to farm it out to private firms with no experience. It’s now led by Dido Harding, famous for the Talk Talk data breech. Who, when asked if 4 million customers’ data was encrypted, replied, ‘The awful truth is that I don’t know.\n‘Between the end of May and the end of July, her army of 25,000 contact tracers tracked down a grand total of 51,524 people exposed to Covid. That’s one contact per month per employee. Staff describe having a WhatsApp group called the “Mouse Movers Club”. They remind each other to move their computer mouse every 15 minutes to avoid the system locking them out.\nThis £10 billion privatised national system contacts only 62% of people exposed to Covid. Compare that with our local public health teams’ success rate of 99%. Public health teams get £300 million, just 3% of the budget given to Dido Harding’s outfit.\nHow did Dido Harding get this job? A track record of running similar operations? An exhaustive selection against stiff competition? Nope. Harding was handed the job by Tory health secretary Matt Hancock. You judge whether it’s a coincidence that she’s married to the Conservative MP John Penrose. Whose think-tank, 1828, has called for the NHS to be replaced by universal health insurance.\nAll pretence of fiscal rectitude or democratic accountability has been abandoned. The government is refusing to publish details of the issued contracts. Under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, this refusal to be transparent is illegal. The Good Law Project launched legal action against them. If you’re outraged by the government’s corruption, give the Good Law Project your support.\nMinisters used to take responsibility for failure. When caught doing favours in return for donations, they’d resign. The Prime Minister’s strategy must be to keep as many incompetent ministers as possible, so he doesn’t look so bad.\nOn that subject, this week saw the surprise resignation of Simon Clarke, Minister for Devolution (for personal reasons). As a Labour Mayor in power, I have to build alliances to get things done, and Simon was a strong supporter of devolution. Simon was open, good to work with, and on top of the detail. His departure removes one of the few competent ministers in government.\nNow Boris & co have chosen to break international law. They’ve reneged on a treaty signed less than a year ago. Britain is trying to secure trade deals around the world. Tens of thousands of North East jobs depend on exports.\nThe world used to look to Britain as a benchmark of good governance. Now Johnson’s Britain is increasingly looking like Putin’s Russia: a kleptocracy.\nPosted originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 14.9.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_manifesto_green-new-deal_put-wellbeing-ahead-of-gdp/content_56.html": "Put wellbeing and equality ahead of GDP\nThe North of Tyne is the only Combined Authority that has implemented a wellbeing framework. All of our policies and process are measured against long-term outcomes that are good for our people, instead of clumsy measures like GDP, which conceal health and wealth inequality.\nIt measures things like real income, having good quality homes in safe communities, having access to greenspaces, and having a voice in the decisions that affect us. I’d extend this to the whole region.\nWales introduced the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act. I’d appoint a Future Generations Commissioner to champion long-term thinking in decision making, and convene our region to support this.\nI’d also convene a Tolerance and Diversity commission. This will not seek to supplant existing initiatives, but instead give a voice in decision making. It will include representatives from communities, and the voluntary, public and business sectors to ensure real progress is made. This will cover all forms of racism, hate and oppression.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_are-we-there-yet/content_188.html": "Are we there yet?\nOctober 15, 2023\n“Are we there yet?” If you’ve ever taken kids on a journey it’s a racing certainty that question has been asked.\nBut does the cancellation of the second leg of HS2 mean we’re closer to having the transport system the North East needs?\nI wanted HS2 fully delivered, on time, on budget, starting in Edinburgh and working south through Newcastle, to Leeds and beyond.\nWe were promised sleek, modern, aerodynamic trains swooshing up and down the line. Birds and wildlife looking on in amazement and admiration as the 3.30pm to Leeds whizzed past. Cutesy woodland animals from Bambi on a nearby embankment.\nInstead, HS2 started in London. Decades later, it was going to reach York. Then the trains would chug on up to Newcastle at normal speed. But without new lines, existing services would be withdrawn.\nThe eastern leg was cancelled two years ago. That left London to Birmingham to Manchester. In July this year the Infrastructure and Projects Authority rated even that as ‘red’ – undeliverable.\nWe may never know how much HS2 would have cost. Clearly far more than the original £37.5 billion price tag. The leaked 2020 Oakervee Review quoted £106.6 billion.\nOverspend is not inevitable. In the North East, Nexus delivered the Metro Flow project to South Shields £5 million under budget and only 1 week late, despite Covid.\nAt my Mayor’s Question Times, members of the public have said HS2 would not benefit the North East, instead sucking up all the investment into the south and Midlands.\nIf you asked the people of Newcastle or Sunderland, “Would you rather have more Metro lines and a better North East bus service, or travel 140 miles to Manchester to get on a high-speed train to London?” I think it’s pretty obvious which they’d choose.\nMany cabinet ministers wanted the money returned to Treasury. I contacted the Transport Secretary Mark Harper and said since you are obviously going to cancel it, can you spend the money on other Northern transport projects instead?\nIn the end we saw a back-of-an-envelope plan published at Conservative conference. It clarified little. It’s called Network North, despite including Plymouth and Bristol. I remember when the Conservatives were good at slick presentation.\nThe official command paper was more useful. It confirmed the Blyth Relief Road, Sunderland dual carriageway into the city centre, and the Tyne Bridge refurbishment. We were already getting them 85% funded. Now it’s 100% funded, saving council tax payers the balance. Hardly HS2, mind.\nI’m still chasing up A1 dualling. Some of those junctions are lethal, and upgrades should allow for a better rural bus service. There is at least a budget line now. I’ll be closely reading the Autumn Statement and Treasury documents.\nWhat is certain is we’re getting extra devolved transport money. £1.8 billion over five years from 2027. We can use that for projects and programmes that directly benefit the North East.\nI want to build a Total Transport Network, connecting every town and village with buses, fully integrated into the Metro and rail system, including the new Northumberland Line that opens next year.\nA single ticket that gets you where you want to go. Reliably, cheaply and comfortably. With free travel for under-18s.\nProjects like re-opening the Leamside Line. A 21-mile stretch of track from Ferryhill through Washington and onto Gateshead and Newcastle. Bringing it back into use would allow us to both expand the Metro and increase the number of services on the national rail network.\nLocally the Leamside Line has been on a cross-party wish list for years. I’ve spoken to the Transport Secretary about getting Government to part fund it. The priority now is getting the engineers’ reports completed to establish the actual costs.\nIt should be a cross-party national priority too. I spoke to Shadow Transport Secretary Lou Haigh in person, in London, in February. She confirmed Labour would fully fund the Leamside Line. She repeated that promise on stage with me in March, in Newcastle, at the Transport for the North Conference. I’ve written to her for confirmation that Labour will honour that promise.\nI’ll let you know if I get a reply. But at the moment, no, we’re not there yet.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_rishis-budget-porkies/content_283.html": "Rishi’s Budget Porkies\nOctober 31, 2021\nLet’s start this week with a quiz. Multiple choice – which of these is true?\nThe UK is “well on the way to recovery.”\nThe UK has “the fastest growth in the G7.”\nWe are in a “new age of optimism.”\n“We can’t afford to borrow any more.”\nEon Productions have invited me to play a cameo role in the next James Bond film.\nThey’re all false, apart from that last one. Which is also false. But if Rishi Sunak is allowed to tell porkies in the Budget, I’m allowed to make a rhetorical point in my column.\n“Our success will be measured not by the billions we spend, but by the outcomes we achieve, and the difference we make to people’s lives,” he said. Hard to disagree, but Mr. Sunak and I want to make different differences.\nI want to end poverty, create jobs, and tackle the climate emergency. He wants to… do what exactly? Strip away the rhetoric, and it’s hard to see what his budget will achieve. On Thursday I was in a meeting with the other northern Labour Mayors. “He was auditioning to be Boris’s replacement,” said one, “that budget was aimed at Tory MPs, no one else.”\nIn September, our Combined Authority sent the Chancellor our Comprehensive Spending Review proposals. Specific, evidence-backed schemes. £639 million of projects attracting £3.5 billion of private investment, creating 14,500 jobs. Projects on low-carbon living, increased research and development, and strengthening the UK’s resilience to future pandemics.\nWe’re making rapid progress towards a Clean Energy Economy, with new jobs in net-zero industries. We’re closing the education gap and getting more people into jobs & training. We’re focusing on rapid renewal for our towns, high streets, communities and places. On transport and infrastructure that drives green growth.\nMy vision – and NTCA’s vision – for the region is a place where kids want to stay when they graduate. A place where people want to bring up families. A place with good jobs, with good prospects and good wages. But it needs investment.\nOn that, who do you think the UK Government borrows from? Government sold £450 billion in bonds through the pandemic. A bond is a legally-binding IOU. Government says, “you give me £1000 now, and I’ll give you it back in ten years time.” They pay interest in the meantime, known as the ‘coupon’. Interest rates are currently 0.1%. So for every £1000, Government pays £1 a year.\nBut here’s the clever part. The bonds were sold to the Bank of England, via something called Quantitative Easing. Which means the Bank of England pays the interest right back to the Treasury. If you think that’s exactly the same as creating money, you’re right. So in fact, borrowing to invest puts the UK Govt in debt to no one but itself.\nSo Mr. Sunak’s choice to cut Universal Credit by £20 a week and plunge 300,000 children into poverty was not economic, but ideological. All he’s done is make the future worse – every child who has a difficult start in life weakens our whole society.\nHe could have invested £639 million here, in the North of Tyne. He could have empowered us to create 14,500 jobs. Each job pays income tax and NICs. Payroll taxes alone would repay the money in just five years. Add in the VAT, corporation tax, and low-carbon growth, and Government would see its money at least doubled.\nWhy didn’t he? The answer is ideology. A fortnight ago, I was in the room and heard the Prime Minister say that Government has limited power to fix the climate crisis – it was up to the free market and consumer choice. He said elsewhere that the lorry driver crisis is the fault of lorry drivers and haulage firms. His Government outsourced test and trace to private companies with no experience, in a colossal waste of public money.\nIn short, this Government is led by people who don’t believe Government should fix things. And so it is, we go into COP26 with no credible plan to fix the climate emergency for our kids and grandkids. Just a cut in taxes to Air Passenger Duty, the most polluting form of transport there is.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 01 Nov 2021",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_real-wellbeing-requires-abundant-green-and-blue-spaces/content_233.html": "Real Wellbeing Requires Abundant Green and Blue Spaces\nDecember 27, 2020\nThe places where we live and the stresses we face constantly change, but the importance of our friendships remain. Living in safe, attractive communities is essential for our wellbeing. Connection to others defines our sense of belonging, our place in the world. It’s not surprising that research shows a strong link between a sense of community and emotional wellbeing.\nBefore Christmas, the North of Tyne hosted a wellbeing policy workshop. What really matters to quality of life? For too long public policy has focused on remote statistics like GDP and growth rate. We’re in the middle of the worst recession ever. How we rebuild will define our futures.\nThe Carnegie Trust’s head of policy is a pioneer in this field. She described how striving to hit economic indicators misses the point about the real environment that shapes people’s health, wealth and happiness. The Welsh Government’s commissioner for the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act ran us through their approach. How every policy decision is viewed through the lens of what effect will this have in ten, twenty, fifty years time. This has put long-term sustainability front and centre of policy making. Not just carbon footprints, but the visual quality of the environment; the effect of green spaces on mental health. Good old fashioned happiness.\nThe obsession with GDP, growth, and the FTSE index leaves a huge majority of people falling through the gaps. Everything is done for some greater good, that few of us seem to share in. The claim that trickle-down works. That “a rising tide lifts all boats”.\nIn the decade before Covid, UK GDP grew from £1.6 trillion to £2.1 trillion. A 34% increase. In the same period, knife crime increased 42%, rough sleeping increased 169% and foodbank use increased 3900%.\nThe rising tide is great if you own a yacht. But it leaves the rest of us cold and wet. And some drown.\nTo quote Lillie Franks, Writer of Wrongs on Twitter:\nReplacing the words “The Economy” with “rich people’s yacht money”.\nHow can we respond to COVID without sacrificing rich people’s yacht money?\nSaving the environment sounds nice but what about rich peoples yacht money.\nMedicare for all would destroy rich peoples yacht money.\nWe’ve put inclusive economy at the heart of our approach. The new jobs we’re creating have to be good jobs. Paid enough to live on, with job security, where mental health is taken seriously. It matches our commitment to community cohesion. Left to the market, there would be nowhere we could meet that doesn’t involve spending money.\nReal wellbeing requires abundant green and blue spaces, and safe spaces to interact with our neighbours. Communities need a vibrant centre, a focus for people of all ages to participate in education, economic and cultural life. We’re laying some of the groundwork with our £1.5 million Community Hubs project.\nThere’s a real wealth of talent and goodwill in our communities. With Crowdfund North of Tyne, we’re giving this a bit of a nudge to encourage people. The range of projects getting community buy-in has been fantastic. Five have been selected for funding from the first funding cycle.\nThe community beekeeping project will be based at the Meadow Well Connected centre in North Shields. Set up by a local man, it will help people to learn the basics of beekeeping without needing to fork out for all the kit. There’s funding to place ten beehives at the centre. It’ll be run intergenerationally, with kids, parents and grandparents, and include people with disabilities. What a great way to bring people together, while also providing a pollination service to local gardens and allotments. With honey at the end of it!\nSustainability means tackling the climate crisis. But it also means placing people at the centre of policy, ahead of abstract economic indicators. The 2009 book, the Spirit Level, documents the “pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, and encouraging excessive consumption”.\nFor every measure of health or social problems, the more unequal a country is, the worse the problems are. Whether a country is rich or poor overall, it is inequality that increases physical ill health, mental ill health, drug abuse, imprisonment, obesity, violence, teenage pregnancies, and child abuse.\nOne homeless person sleeping rough diminishes us all.

She works two part-time, minimum-wage jobs, in Chester-le-Street. There’s one unreliable bus an hour, and it costs her £19.80 for transport and childcare.\nShe leaves the house at 8am to drop her daughter off, and she gets home at 4pm.\nIt’s taking her 8 hours to earn less than £17.00 net wages.\nAnd she can’t see where it ends. She said, “People say ‘you’ve got to learn to manage your money’ – but I’m on top of every penny.”\nShe’s working all hours to build a better life for her little girl. But she’s worried she’ll be in the same position in 20 years’ time. She can’t see a way out of it.\nIn the 70s and early 80s, we had park keepers. We had youth clubs. We had bus conductors, who helped with your pram, or your shopping.\nMy Mam worked part-time as a telephonist. My Dad was a shift worker at ICI. With four kids, they could still afford to buy a house when they were young.\nI left school at 16, and worked in a factory. If you wanted new materials, you filled out an order. Someone in the typing pool (remember them?) typed a letter, put it in an envelope, and posted it to the supplier. These days, you just scan a code.\nProductivity has leapt forwards with computers and the internet. Every job is way more efficient now. We even scan our own shopping. It must be saving shedloads of money.\nSo where has all that money gone? Why can’t we afford park keepers and youth workers and bus conductors?\nWhy are working people queuing up at food banks?\nBecause tax dodgers and oligarchs are asset-stripping our country.\nBefore Christmas, Storm Arwen left 5000 North East homes with no electricity for a fortnight.\nNorthern Powergrid makes £125 million profit a year, on a turnover of £355 million. It’s privately owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, previously known as MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, run by Warren Buffet, who has a personal fortune of $102 billion.\nOver £100 million a year we lose from our region, which could have been reinvested in it.\nIt’s the same in the NHS. And probation. And PFI.\nOutsourcing and privatisation isn’t about efficiency, and never was. It’s about the mega-rich taking our money, leaving people working two jobs, unable to make ends meet.\nI know there’s a better system than this.\nThe Tories have been in power since 2010. And their austerity has smashed the UK’s resilience.\nCOVID hit so hard because of underfunded emergency planning and preparedness. Fire and Police budgets slashed. Ambulance services on their knees. Local authority capabilities destroyed.\nAnd it’s not just about economic injustice. 732 sub-postmasters wrongfully prosecuted. The Government spending £1.6 million on lawyers to oppose the victims. No-one held accountable.\n97 unlawful deaths at Hillsborough – 30 years to get to the truth. No-one held accountable.\nThousands of families bereaved through Covid, while No10 partied – and an inquiry kicked into the long grass.\nWhat needs levelling-up is the scales of justice.\nBritain needs a Labour government delivering long-term investment in the health and education of our people. And guiding Britain through a world more dangerous than I can ever remember.\nWorld leaders have not stepped up to the challenge of climate change. Fossil fuel companies make £billions in profits. Tory donors are granted oil and gas exploration licenses in the middle of a climate emergency.\nThe sovereign nation of Ukraine has been invaded. Hospitals and nursery schools bombed. Nuclear power plants shelled. While Vladimir Putin imprisons children who protest for peace in Russia. He must face war crimes court, as all war mongers must. High office and powerful friends should offer no immunity. For anyone.\nI want to see a Labour Government with the guts to stand up to billionaire oligarchs, whose financial greed and bullying fuels war and poverty, and destroys our planet.\nWe must hold our course for economic and social and climate justice. And not sink to throwing red meat to appease those who play from the handbook of hate.\nWhat will be the future if we trade justice for a tabloid headline?\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 7 March 2022",

Having a good job that you enjoy is life changing. It’s not just good for the local economy, it’s good for your self-esteem and confidence. There are no down sides of creating good jobs. I see it as the cornerstone of my role as Mayor. Every job we create is backed by our Good Work Pledge – meaning fair pay, workers are listened to and looked after, and get the chance of training and progression.\nIf you believe their corporate websites, every oil company on the planet has already solved climate change, and protected some fluffy cute animals into the bargain. Once you decode the technical language, the claims ring hollow. Jobswash is a bit like Greenwash. “This new Government policy will create three squllion new jobs”.\nOur figures are much more tightly controlled. Because we have to report on our progress to Treasury, we have strict criteria for what counts as a “job”. It has to be full-time, it must be held for over a year, and it must be the direct result of our cash investment. So if we bring a new firm here, and they hire construction workers to fit out their new offices, we don’t count those jobs, important though they are. If a new start-up buys its materials from a local supplier, we don’t count those indirect jobs. When the workers in the new, direct jobs we create spend money in local shops and restaurants, boosting employment, we don’t count those indirect jobs either. Just direct jobs.\nSo how do we go about it? We work in big sectors like digital and offshore wind. We help firms with recruitment and finding premises, and digital infrsatructure. That’s how we’ve attracted big digital technology companies here. In some cases setting up their UK headquarters here instead of London. Firms like Verisure, Xplor, Monstarlab, Version 1 and Thoughtworks. All paying good wages. And we’re developing a new cluster around healthy ageing\nIt’s not all about working with big businesses. We work with medium sized businesses. Often you’ll find businesses hit a barrier to their growth. Maybe they would overcome it in 2 or 3 years or maybe they wouldn’t. We help with those barriers through our Growth Funds so they start employing people now.\nWe’ve invested into Battleship Wharf in Blyth and clearing the Swan Hunter site to make more space for the growing offshore industry. Our TIGGOR programme invests directly in research and development, so local firms can compete with the globals, and develop new products that get manufactured here. (Great name, eh? TIGGOR – Technology, Innovation and Green Growth for Offshore Renewables.) Local firms have grown, employed more people, and are exporting offshore wind components across the world.\nThen there is our incredibly important hinterland of small businesses. We’ve helped over 1700 with advice and support, and over 100 with direct investment. We helped local cycling firm Saddle Skedaddle develop an internet savvy customer journey, so they can increase their sales of eco-holidays, and employ more staff. We’ve helped local joinery firm Damian Cronin digitise their production. They’ve now employed more joiners and apprentices, and are exporting to Japan. All the new jobs in these small firms add up. This is investment in the real economy – in firms that pay their taxes and pay their workers properly.\nWe’re directly investing in rural areas with our Rural Growth fund. Our Culture and Creative fund provides equity and soft loans to freelancers and small firms in the arts, culture and creative sector. Helping them get online and boost their business and grow.\nAdd all this together and we have a pipeline of 4,487 direct jobs. Our emergency £5 million investment and other funds have safeguarded another 2,700 jobs that could have been lost through the pandemic. The North of Tyne doesn’t count indirect jobs, but the extra money in our region is creating them too.\nAll the evidence shows that more money in working people’s pockets leads to better health, better educational outcomes for kids, and less pressure on our underfunded public services. Creating jobs – good jobs – is a virtuous circle.\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 28 Feb 2022",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_who-carries-the-baton-of-hope-in-such-dark-and-challenging-times/content_234.html": "Who carries the baton of hope in such dark and challenging times?\nJuly 2, 2023\nLast week I was honoured to address the Newcastle leg of the ‘Baton of Hope’ tour – a suicide awareness and prevention project set up by two parents, who both lost sons to mental illness.\nThe rain lashed down as the crowd huddled together, friends and strangers alike, under the arches at Newcastle University. It seemed a fitting scene as the contributors spoke. One after another describing how their lives had been touched by love, loss and ultimately the precious but delicate flame of hope. The symbolism was unavoidable, sheltering together from the storm outside, subconsciously nurturing that flame.\nSuicide is the biggest killer of men and women under 35 in the UK. More than road traffic accidents. More than cancer. Seventeen people die by suicide every single day. Just let that sink in.\nSuicide is a stark manifestation of the mental health crisis. Like physical health, prevention is key. Anything from having a cuppa and a chat with a friend, to specialist clinical support. As with physical health, the intervention must match the condition. If you’re having a heart attack, you wouldn’t call a homeopath.\nMental ill health has many causes – childhood trauma, bereavement, discrimination, isolation, poverty, stress. But it’s this last one, stress, that I see most often.\nFamous health researcher Prof. Michael Marmot describes a certain kind of stress linked to our position in society – the status syndrome. The ‘stress arising from the inability to control our lives, to turn to others when we lose control or to participate fully in all that society has to offer. A way to stress an animal, of the human or non-human variety, is to remove control.’\nIt’s no fluke that the most successful political slogan this century was ‘take back control’.\nIf you asked 100 random people from Blyth, Berwick or Byker if they feel in control of their lives, I’d be surprised if more than 10 answered yes. Not surprising, given last year the Collins Dictionary word of the year was ‘permacrisis’.\nFrom Brexit to Covid to the cost-of-living crisis, we are being told to ‘hold our nerve’ as the good times are maybe, possibly, hopefully, just around the corner. But let’s not kid ourselves, if you’re the CEO of a mail, rail, water or oil company – the good times are already here. In fact, they are better than ever! The boss of Shell pocketed almost £10million last year. By comparison, a first year Junior Doctor in the NHS will earn under £30k, and have to repay £70k in student debt. That’s ‘status syndrome’ right there.\nMy politics is simple. I believe Britain should be run in the interests of the people who do the work. I believe that people should be treated with dignity and respect. I believe a decent quality of life should be available to all – not just the CEOs and investment bankers. And I believe that people should be given the tools and support to control their own destinies. And that includes carers, the retired, the young and those unable to work through ill health or disability.\nAs Mayor, I work hard to help people in the region regain that sense of control over their lives. It could be through skills training – allowing people to earn more money to ease those end-of-the-month woes. It could be regaining confidence and fighting isolation by joining a group crafting session at a community hub we’ve supported. It could be taking the leap to start a small business with funding we’re providing.\nWhen we take those steps to reclaim control, we are telling ourselves that hope persists.\nAs the late Tony Benn put it ‘there are two flames burning in the human heart all the time. The flame of anger against injustice, and the flame of hope you can build a better world.’\nSo, who carries the baton of hope in such dark and challenging times? Surely, it’s all of us. So, let’s nurture that flame – in ourselves and each other.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_international-workers-memorial-day/content_131.html": "International Workers Memorial Day\nApril 27, 2020\n“Remembering the dead, fighting for the living”.\n(First published in The Newcastle Journal and The Newcastle Evening Chronicle 27 April 2020.)\nThat’s the message from International Workers’ Memorial Day which falls tomorrow. It’s never been more relevant.\nDid you know that every year more people are killed at work than in war? Most don’t die of ‘tragic accidents’ or mystery ailments. In Europe alone, work-related accidents and illnesses kill 200,000 people every year. They die because an employer decided their safety was less important than the bottom line.\nIn the North East, we have a history of coal mining and heavy industry. We’re no strangers to work-related death and diseases. Thousands of miners in the Northumberland and Durham coalfields lost their lives, or suffered chronic illness. Not just men, but children too. Next week commemorates the Spinney Disaster at Heaton Colliery. On 3rd May 1815 75 men and boys lost their lives.\nCoal mining, along with much of our heavy industry, has now gone. Yet workers are still losing their lives or being left with injury and illness because of negligence. Mental ill health from work-related stress is the modern industrial disease. TUC research shows that over 11 million working days are lost each year from it. It affects 400,00 workers. It can leave lifelong psychological and physical disability.\nWith austerity, staff are under-paid and over-worked. Our public services are so badly underfunded that some workers are doing the jobs of two or three people. We could see what would happen. We warned what the cuts would cause. These risks to workers’ health were entirely foreseeable. So were the risks of ignoring reports to prepare properly for a pandemic.\nCompassion is not a weakness. Looking only at the “bottom line” is not good economics. The economy is not separate from society. The workforce is not separate from society. We are society. Work should enrich us, not endanger us.\nIn the year of coronavirus, this day of commemoration is more essential than ever. The pandemic affects every worker regardless of job or location. Millions are losing pay. Others are out of work. Many have improvised working from home. Keyworkers are risking exposure to the virus to keep society going. Tens of thousands have fallen ill. And three months since the outbreak, vast numbers of workers still don’t have the PPE they need.\nCovid-19 has now killed over a hundred health and social care workers in the UK. We’ve seen the moving accounts on TV. Grieving relatives and colleagues devastated by their loss. How much of this grieving could have been prevented if we’d only invested to protect frontline staff?\nThe failure to provide adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been laid bare over recent weeks. The TUC has made a call for a judge-led public enquiry in to the “grotesque failure” of the government’s PPE planning. This is not about closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. It’s about ensuring that workers are not put at risk again.\nWe also need to know why the virus is taking such a heavy toll on BAME workers. Around two thirds of the NHS staff who have died from Covid-19 are from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities. As is every one of the 15 doctors who’ve died so far. Kier Starmer has tasked Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the party’s new race relations advisor, to launch a review in to the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities.\nRemembrance is an act of solidarity. So that we renew our efforts to organise collectively. To prevent more deaths and work-related injury and disease – whatever the cause. After this crisis has passed, we must stand shoulder to shoulder with these workers. There must be no service cuts or job losses. No excuses for more austerity.\nSo on Tuesday, I’ll be observing a minute’s silence at 11am It’s a moment to pay tribute to the ill and the fallen. A moment of solidarity with those still exposed. It’s also the time to commit to protecting those who continue to do vital work.\nWe remember the dead and we fight for the living.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_standing-up-for-the-north/content_180.html": "Standing up for the North\nOctober 18, 2020\nA week is a long time in a pandemic.\nLast Friday, (9th Oct), a meeting with Number 10 mysteriously popped into my calendar. Ministers wanted to talk to me and my Local Authority colleagues about the new Tier system. Later that afternoon, as I logged into the video conference, it got cancelled.\nEventually there was a briefing with a civil servant. It would all end in Tiers, we were told.\n“But what are the criteria for moving from Tier to another?” I asked. We don’t have that information, was the answer.\n“Why have no ministers come on this call?” asked one of my Local Authority leader colleagues. “Erm, none were available.” “Who makes the decisions?” Unknown.\n“What are the restrictions?” Pubs will shut. And possibly restaurants. Or possibly not. And gyms, and soft play. But not universities, despite there being two universities in Newcastle with over 1000 cases each.\nAfter an hour we knew for certain that we might or might not be in Tier 2 or Tier 3, which might or might not mean closing some businesses or others, and someone unspecified would make the decision, but on what basis and with what evidence we didn’t know. World beating.\nThe Government’s publicity machine then announced on national television, radio and in print, that we’d had meaningful engagement.\nI spoke to the other Northern Mayors. They’d had the same fiascos.\nWhy do we get no support while in Tier 2, to prevent us needing to move into Tier 3? Surely, if this is about containing the virus, we should get resources now to keep people safe.\nBy Monday morning, government had located some cabinet ministers and the PM’s senior advisors. It’s such a pity that it takes media pressure.\nCross party, local leaders are as one on this issue. We will not agree to moving into Tier 3 and destroy livelihoods unless we see evidence that it will keep people safer, or we get the financial support to protect our people. No one gets left behind.\nThe fact is, you should only close a place if it is spreading the virus. Otherwise you just move the problem elsewhere.\nMost businesses are taking their responsibilities seriously and doing a cracking job keeping people safe. And a few aren’t. But, the powers to close non-compliant businesses are weak, and subject to lengthy legal challenge.\nThis Friday (16th Oct) we finally got a briefing with the Deputy Chief Medical officer, a minister and senior No 10 advisor. The tone was different. It was professional, evidence based. Our Local Public Health experts discussed the data. It was concluded, that the existing restrictions are having some effect. We should remain in Tier 2, unless the evidence changes.\nI followed up on getting the powers we need, and trying to get more financial support to prevent moving into Tier 3. When you can get a junior minister 1-to-1, the meetings can be productive.\nWhere does this leave us?\nWe’re in Tier 2 for now. We still don’t know the criteria that would cause the PM to move us into Tier 3. If we did, we could communicate it, and build public support.\nWe want people to keep safe – so please, wear your mask, wash your hands, and keep socially distanced. Please follow the law and the guidelines. You’ll be keeping yourself safe, keeping your relatives safe, and setting good example. And you might protect people’s jobs and livelihoods too.\nPublished originally in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 19.10.20",

  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_spending-review-pay-freeze/content_224.html": "Spending Review = Pay Freeze\nNovember 29, 2020\nOn Wednesday we had the long-awaited spending review. Since May the Chancellor had told us it would be a comprehensive spending review. There was nothing comprehensive in this. No multi-year strategic vision.\nWhat did we get? A public sector pay freeze. Let’s call that for what it is: a pay cut in real terms. Ministers were keen to post videos of themselves clapping keyworkers back in the summer. But firefighters, teachers, council workers and countless others have been insulted. Despite all the personal risk, inadequate PPE, cancelled leave days and unpaid overtime, they are still paid less today than in 2010. This is more of the austerity that even the International Monetary Fund say is economically damaging.\nThe “levelling up fund” will release £600 million next year. But it’s a competitive bid process for the whole of the country, not about levelling up the North. No strategic criteria have been set. The Towns Fund has been plagued with cases of pork-barrel politics: ministers signing off money for places that serve their re-election needs. The public value for money is invariably poor.\nThe third item of note was £billions for the DWP to get people into jobs. Which sounds good, until you think about the basic logic. Rather than spending £billions to help people find jobs, wouldn’t it make more sense to spend money creating jobs? Making people spend 30 hours a week hunting for jobs that don’t exist is dispiriting and demeaning. People will find the jobs if the jobs are there.\nWe’ve been through this loop time and again in the past ten years of austerity. Serco’s failure on test and trace. Carillion going bust. Damning value-for-money audit reports for corporate outsourcing firms.\nThey have this ideological obsession that if government does nothing, multi-nationals will create millions of jobs. It won’t, it hasn’t, and it never will unless the government intervenes. It’s far too profitable for big money to speculate on property portfolios and share buybacks. Meanwhile, 3 million small businesses are falling through the gaps of coronavirus support.\nWe’ve taken a different approach in the North of Tyne. We’ve safeguarded 1,782 jobs, and our projects are in place creating 2,732 new jobs across Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland. This week we’ve announced another 500 new jobs created, bringing a global software developer here. These are good jobs – high paying, high skill, permanent jobs. Not minimum wage jobs in the gig economy. They are low-carbon jobs, exporting software over the internet.\nWe’re doing this with £20 million a year, and we’ve only been going 18 months. If we had the firepower that central government has, we could end unemployment. Across the country, Mayoral Combined Authorities have hit timescales and budgets time after time.\nImagine what this spending review could have been. The Chancellor could have said, “There you go, Jamie, there you go other Mayors, here’s half a billion, build me 5,000 homes.” We’ve got desperate need for affordable housing, for eco-friendly homes. We could have created jobs, lined up the apprenticeships and training opportunities, worked with supply chains to keep money in local economies. And at the end of it, we’d have the houses – real, tangible financial assets. Ultimately, it costs the taxpayer nothing – it pays for itself.\nOver the summer, government wrote to me, and asked me to develop a plan for economic recovery. Everyone in the region pulled together, north and south of the Tyne, Local Authorities, businesses, universities, the lot. It would generate 55,000 high-quality jobs, 26,000 training opportunities, 15,000 new homes and retrofit another 100,000. It included clean, fast public transport, getting everyone where they needed to go reliably. It protected livelihoods, moving thousands of jobs from older, polluting industries into zero-carbon sustainable jobs. Also it boosted the economy so it would pay for itself with increased taxes from firms and the spending power it would have put in your pocket.\nThat’s why we need serious devolution. The CBI, Trade Unions, Think Tanks, Local Authorities, higher education, and, well, pretty much everyone thinks it’s long overdue. By law, there has to be a budget before next April. For all our sakes, let’s hope the Chancellor gets it right next time.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 30.11.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_welcome-to-the-real-north/content_240.html": "Welcome to the Real North\nMay 30, 2021\nThere are some fascinating photos online by Finnish photographer Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen. They cover the North East and focus on Byker, where she lived, showing the gritty, grubby reality of our region in the early 1970s.\nNot that long ago, this is how people pictured the North East. Pit villages. Fishing. Heavy industry. Not quite the dark, satanic mills, but nigh enough. It reminds me of that brilliant Monty Python Four Yorkshiremen sketch – ‘a house? Luxury! There were 150 of us living in a small shoe box in’t middle o’t road!’\nThe rest of the country probably hasn’t moved on from those views, except maybe to add ‘good place for stag and hen parties’.\nThose of us who are lucky enough to live in the North East know the truth.\nWe know that we can walk in the footsteps of John Dobson and Richard Grainger, marvel at some superb architecture, and enjoy some great food while we’re at it.\nWe can go back even further and walk in the footsteps of the Roman centurions, posted to one of the furthest outposts of their Empire. We can even visit a Metro station with signage in Latin.\nWe can transport ourselves, and our kids, to Hogwarts and relish over 700 years of history while the kids have a broomstick lesson.\nWe can walk the miles of stunning coastline. I know I’m biased, but it really is magnificent. And we can see seals and puffins in their natural habitat.\nWe can visit a working fish quay, and choose from an impressive array of fish and shellfish – Fortnum and Mason’s fish counter has nowt on North Shields.\nWe can watch some great live shows and theatre, and see films on the big or small screen.\nAll this, and more, is on our doorstep. How lucky are we?\nWe can make things even better, of course. A lot of people miss out – we can improve affordability as well as physical accessibility.\nEverything we enjoy doing needs to be ecologically sustainable, or our grandkids won’t be enjoying those seals and puffins.\nAnd we need to create a more joined-up transport system, so it’s easy to see how you get from A to B on a range of public transport options, that don’t cost the earth.\nWe also need to keep our attractions authentic, so visitors feel they are being welcomed to the real North, and not to a plastic copy. One of the best ways to do that is to make sure that local people, as well as tourists, want to have a grand day out. Local festivals are key to this – making local people feel the event is their own. Things like the Newcastle Improv Festival. How brilliant to give people the opportunity to perform their own stand-up routines.\nThe pandemic is likely to mean lots more people are having a holiday in this country, rather than abroad. Staying local will be great for the local economy. We have great scenery and historical landmarks, but we want a rich tapestry of food, music and local entertainment too.\nThat’s why the North of Tyne is investing over £3 million in a two-year calendar of tourism and events. And another £3.25m to support the recovery of the culture and creative industry. We know that happiness is as dependent on what you do outside of work as what you do in work.\nI’ve had several meetings recently with Sir Brendan Foster, and I’m supporting his sterling efforts to get the Government to financially back a bid to stage the 2026 European Athletics Championships in the North East of England.\nThis would involve over 1500 athletes and 6 days of competition, showcasing the region, and with the potential to generate tens of millions of pounds of economic impact. Hundreds of jobs and spin-out opportunities, and bring tens of thousands of visitors and spectators here.\nBrendan also persuaded me to run in the Great North Run on 21st September. I’ve run marathons and half-marathons before, but not for a while! We’ll see what effects the lockdown’s had on my stamina and my knees! I hope to see many of you there cheering us on.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 31 May 2021",

We have developed a strategic partnership with Power to Change to take this work forward.\nAlthough we account for 2.3% of the UK economy, only 1.4% of the total UK private equity and venture capital is invested here. By having a fund to directly invest in small, local firms, start-ups and scale-ups, we can accelerate the economic recovery. As the fund grows, the money will be recycled, supporting more local firms, and creating more jobs here.\nSMEs, particularly those that are socially-trading (e.g. co-operatives and Community Interest Companies) have traditionally had difficulty in getting access to the financial backing they need. Socially trading SMEs, of which there are 5,000 in our region, employ 30,000 people and so are a crucial part of our local economy.\nTogether with Insights North East and Power to Change we hosted ‘Growing the North-East social economy throughinnovative finance’ at Newcastle University. This event was a chance to learn about the initial findings from the Call for Evidence and discuss how to co-design the new and innovative finance initiatives to grow the social economy.\nTo create wealth in an area the people must own the assets. This is why I’m committed to building the co-operative movement. I’m Labour and Co-operative Metro Mayor. Harnessing the strengths of the co-operative movement for the benefit of the North of Tyne has been at the very core of my plans.\nMy election manifesto included commitments on co-operative development, from housing to supporting new co-operative start-ups and much more to ensure that our region can benefit from a movement that puts people at its heart.\nOur £4m Social Finance Fund, part of the £15m Access to Finance package, is to develop and transform the social economy in the North of Tyne. It will provide vital support for cooperatives and businesses trading with a social purpose.\nThe co-operative economy is critical to how we rebuild from the difficult recent period, where their co-operative values and principles ensure they are run in the interests of their customers, employees, our local community and the wider environment, rather than distant shareholders and investors. The aim is to get many more co-operatives and socially-driven initiatives off the ground.\nAs we continue to rebuild from the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, as a Co-operative Mayor I’m excited that with this dedicated funding we are taking important steps to ensuring the North of Tyne is a welcome region for co-operative development.",

The agricultural revolution increased food production fivefold. New species like potatoes, new techniques like crop rotation, and new technology like wheelless ploughs caused agricultural workers to move to towns.\nInventions like the flying shuttle kicked off the industrial revolution, doubling a weaver’s productivity. Soon after Spinning Jennys increase productivity fivefold. Power looms fortyfold. Canals replaced mule trains. Steam trains replaced canals. The internet is replacing window shopping.\nTechnology hasn’t stopped, and it won’t stop, until we hit the planetary limits of Earth. There are only so many cows we can feed and petrol cars we can drive before parts of our world become unliveable, limiting worldwide food production, and crashing the global economy for good.\nEvery technological leap has caused social shifts. Some awful – like the use of child labour in Victorian factories and workhouses described in Oliver Twist. Some great – such as plummeting infant mortality rates with vaccinations – at least in wealthy countries.\nHistory might regard better working rights, wider education and improved healthcare as inevitable progress, but they always had to be fought for. That struggle continues today. Our trade unions are fighting not just for their pay, but our public services, and the rights of the workers who come after them. Our trade unions are on the right side of history.\nUsing technology for good is a political choice. It’s what we’re doing at the North of Tyne. Since I’ve been Mayor we’ve attracted big tech firms to the region: Verisure, Xplor, Monstarlab, Thoughtworks, Credera, Version 1, and Omnicom. All paying good wages.\nComplemented by jobs in manufacturing and small and medium enterprises. Everything from our investment in Transmission Dynamics in Cramlington, who produce smart bolts that detect when wind turbines need repairing. To helping North Tyneside joinery firm Cronin implement a new digital tracking system to triple their workshop output.\nThey’re all part of the 5,000+ jobs we’re creating. Against a Government target of 10,000 jobs over 30 years. 15 years’ progress in 4 years. A decade ahead of schedule.\nSo can we go further and get a job good to everyone who wants one? There’s plenty needs doing. Insulating homes. Building a clean electricity system. Replacing our transport fleet with green vehicles. And I wouldn’t mind a richer cultural life, too.\nWe just need to match people’s skills to what employers need. We’re making good progress. We’ve increased training course enrolments from 22,000 to 33,000. A 50% increase as a result of devolution. For the same budget. With 96% of people completing their courses. Devolution works –and it’s good value for money.\nThere’s free courses in DIY, rail track engineering, carpentry, building, gardening. Like those run by Build North East in Blyth. They challenge stereotypes and let people try something new.\nI met Pat there. “I’ve always wanted to do something like this. We weren’t allowed when we were at school,” she said, as she drilled away.\nOr like Peter, an HGV driver. A sudden medical condition made him unsafe to drive. His employable skill gone after twenty years’ hard graft. It was tough – the stress caused a spiral of mental ill health and relationship troubles. We fund 1 to 1 coaching to help people like Peter. He’s back on his feet, retrained, confident, and developing his new career.\nAnd that’s the key. Governments are supposed to put their people first. Not “GDP” or “the markets”. That’s code for “put rich donors’ needs ahead of the people who elected us.” We can only succeed by listening to people on the ground – and we can only do that by decentralising power from the Westminster bubble.\nEveryone is good at something. Everyone has a talent. Our job is to help unlock it. Just preferably not with an axe.",

Some Tories are demanding they be classed as a terrorist organisation.\nWhy? Because Extinction Rebellion blocked a road to stop some newspapers being delivered. Apparently, that threatens democracy. They are claiming that Rupert Murdoch’s media empire is essential infrastructure.\nUnder the 2015 Serious Crime Act an organised crime group “has at its purpose, or one of its purposes, the carrying on of criminal activities, and consists of three or more people who agree to act together to further that purpose”.\nThose found to have participated in the activities of an organised crime group can be imprisoned for up to five years.\nThere has been no violence. No one has been hurt. All Extinction Rebellion did was park some lorries on outside the gates of the print works, and build a bamboo scaffold and chain themselves to it. They stopped one day’s delivery of some newspapers. Specifically, Tory supporting newspapers owned by billionaire foreign nationals who do not pay tax in the UK.\nNow, some people might find Extinction Rebellion annoying. Fair enough, I support your right to be peacefully annoyed at people. But that doesn’t make them terrorists. Or a threat to democracy. Murdoch’s News International already has legal recourse against Extinction Rebellion activists. Like anyone else who is inconvenienced or has experienced financial loss, they can sue. There is no need to change the law.\nSerious organised crime is drug smuggling, forcing trafficked women into prostitution, and murdering people. Given the level of violent crime on our streets on a standard pre-Covid Saturday night, I’d say there is a long list of people to deal with before we label climate activists as Mafiosi.\nPersonally, I find right-wing journalists annoying. Those who pedal racism and hate and division and xenophobia and who denigrate the poor and the oppressed. I still wouldn’t claim that Murdoch’s News International is “serious organised crime”. Even after the phone hacking scandal, which was, after all, serious, organised and criminal.\nExtinction Rebellion are a breath of fresh air. Let’s face it, they’re good at putting the climate crisis on the agenda. And speaking as someone with a degree in engineering, I was rather impressed with their bamboo scaffold. I’m all for STEM based ingenuity in our public discourse.\nThe truth is, we do not have a free press. We have a billionaire press, owned by five people who live in tax havens. We have freedom of speech, that’s different.\nMind you, Britain has just been placed on a press freedom watch list by the Council of Europe. An honour we share with such bastions of freedom as Putin’s Russia, and Erdogan’s Turkey. What triggered a Level 2 “media freedom alert” on Britain? Boris Johnson and Priti Patel’s government has blacklisted investigative journalists. So let’s fix that, before we target peaceful protesters. (See the article in the Independent.)\nWe also have freedom of protest. As long as it’s ineffective. That’s what’s at stake here.\nBecause as soon as a protest hits the mega-rich in their pockets, it’s not allowed. Claims that delivering the Daily Telegraph is essential infrastructure equivalent to water or electricity supplies is laughable.\nClaiming that democracy is under threat if people miss a day of the Daily Mail is pure Orwellian Newspeak.\nWhat’s Extinction Rebellion’s beef with these papers? That they don’t tell the truth about the climate crisis. They don’t. It’s not in dispute. Don’t take my word for it. James Murdoch has publicly criticised News International for its deceit about climate breakdown. This is the same James Murdoch who famously sat alongside his father Rupert in front of a Parliamentary inquiry into the phone hacking scandal.\nThere’s a simple resolution here. The papers could just tell the truth. The UN IPCC has said that if even if we meet the obligations of the Paris Agreement, we’ll see around 3.2 degrees of global heating. That’s beyond the threshold for unstoppable feedback – it will destroy the world economy, food production, and leave large parts of the planet uninhabitable. Action has to happen.\nThe worrying thing is that if the Tories implement this law, it won’t just be XR who are targeted.\nRemember all those keyworkers we clapped for? Carers, bus drivers, shop workers, teachers, junior doctors, nurses, senior doctors, fire-fighters, delivery drivers, council workers… you know, everyone who keeps the country running? Well such a law could easily be used to criminalise any industrial action. Do we want to live in a country where anyone who threatens the interests of billionaires will face five years in prison?\nStand with Extinction Rebellion, because you might be next.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-past-we-inherit-the-future-we-build/content_237.html": "“The past we inherit, the future we build”\nJuly 9, 2023\n“The past we inherit, the future we build.” That’s the motto of the National Union of Mineworkers. A century ago more than a million coal miners worked in the UK. Now, fewer than one thousand.\nSo why does the Durham Miners’ Gala take place at all? Let alone attract over 200,000 people, the biggest trade union event in Europe?\nThe Gala is the community speaking to its traditions. Remembering ‘united we stand, divided we fall.’ Literally in the case of miners who relied on the men by their side in the darkness. Figuratively for our region’s people struggling with today’s cost-of-living crisis.\nThe last colliery in Durham closed in 1994, but the miners who worked there, and their children, are still alive. The Durham Miners Association organises the Gala; President Stephen Guy and Secretary Alan Mardghum are both former miners.\nI marched with teachers’ union NASUWT through Durham, along with their General Secretary Pat Roach, and MPs Angela Rayner and Sam Tarry. I say marched. More like standing in the sun, listening to the brass bands, then walking another fifty steps. Inevitably there’s political chat and a catch-up – talking to Pat about our work with teachers and our poverty prevention programme in schools. Like most key workers, this Government has treated teachers appallingly.\nI’d spoken the night before to a rally on trade union freedom – the ever more oppressive anti-union laws are a breach of the UN declaration of human rights. I also spoke to the Socialist Health Association – the way our NHS is being privatised is nothing short of scandalous.\nBut back to the Gala. 57 brass bands marched, and around 90 banners. It’s encouraging how many young people played in the bands – the future of the Gala looks strong.\nIndeed the trade union movement looks stronger than it has for years. Membership is rising as people unite in defence against a cost of living crisis and a Government smash and grab raid on our rights to protest. It’s hard to think of a sector of workers who haven’t had to take industrial action in the past year alone. The newest is the decision to close ticket offices, potentially putting hundreds of RMT members out of work when they’re needed to help the elderly and disabled use our rail system.\nI was kindly invited by the Durham Miners onto the famous balcony of the County Hotel. Waving at the crowds and dancing along with the bands below. I did my best go at YMCA. It’s unlikely that Clement Attlee did when he stood on that spot, or Harold Wilson or Jim Callaghan. Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn might have though.\nBut not Sir Keir Starmer, sadly. It’s disappointing that the leader of the Labour Party declined his invitation to attend. This was mentioned by the chair during the main speeches. Hearing the leader of the Labour Party being booed when his name was mentioned is worrying.\nJust 6% of the public trust our political system, according to a recent IPPR report. Just 6%. Almost everyone outside the Westminster bubble thinks politics is broken. Partygate. Pinchergate. Promises. Pledges.\nWhen universal gratitude to key workers during lockdown is replaced by universal disdain by a political elite. When pay rises for the many are seen as unaffordable while pay rises for the few are just good business.\nWhen people feel no one speaks for them, it creates a vacuum in politics. History tells us this vacuum gets filled by the far-right. We must not let that happen. Speaker after speaker echoed that point – we need a government with a plan for fixing Britain. Who put working people ahead of corporate donors.\nSo here’s my plan.\nFull employment – a good job for everyone who wants one. With fair wages and trade union standard terms and conditions.\nA Total Transport Network – where everyone can get where they need to go cheaply, safely and reliably by bus, Metro and rail.\nA Green New Deal to create new jobs and climate emergency. Moving from our high-carbon coal past into a low-carbon renewable future.\nAbove all, it means deciding our future here in the North East, not in Westminster or Party HQs in London.",

The second best time to plant a tree is today.”\nMay 28, 2023\n“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago”, Stephen told me. “The second-best time to plant a tree is today.”\nWe stood in a forest of young trees planted by Stephen and his team. Conifers. Broadleaf. All around, brilliant yellow gorse flowers glowed in the sun. Punctuating a sea of green. Butterflies fluttered. Birds sang. Close by, a pheasant loped through the undergrowth.\nThere were none of the towering firs, pines, or sequoias that you might see in a place like Cragside. The oaks were barely taller than me – not the majestic, almost mystical, oaks that you so often find in British countryside. Still, this place is something special. I felt like breaking into the lumberjack song….\nIt’s in Doddngton, Northumberland. Just a few years ago, the site was unused low-quality grazing land, unsuitable for crops. That’s key, Stephen told me. He and his business partner, James, co-founded Forest Carbon and helped to transform these fields into one of the largest productive planted forests in England.\nSome of the trees are ours – the North of Tyne Combined Authority’s. We bought them early in my time as Mayor, as saplings, and they’ll sequester carbon out of the atmosphere as they grow. We reduced our emissions as low as possible, and offset the rest.\n“It’s about additionality,” he said. Stephen’s an ex-head teacher from Zimbabwe. Thoughtful and sophisticated in his thinking. “If this forest was commercially viable, your money wouldn’t make any difference – it would have been planted anyway.”\nCarbon offsetting has rightly come under scrutiny. So we invested in creating woodlands here, in the North East. Fully validated under the Woodland Carbon Code. I won’t be claiming we’re operationally net-zero until these trees have actually grown.\nThe scale of the climate emergency can feel overwhelming. The need to act.\nI’m a young(ish) non-disabled person who doesn’t need a van full of tools for work, so I switched my old car for an electric bike. My wife and I are lucky enough to be homeowners with good jobs – we put solar panels on our roof. I have friends in rented accommodation who’ve made a small investment in a solar farm in the countryside. It’ll still help with the bills, and they use more renewable energy.\nIn fact, some of the trees at Doddington are mine – as a family, we offset with UK schemes. Soon Forest Carbon will be making it easier for private citizens to offset in North East projects. Watch this space – I’ll be helping them with the publicity push.\nBut if you’re struggling to pay your bills, the climate emergency will not be top of your list of priorities.\nWe need system change. Personal offsetting seems futile while the likes of Shell and BP are getting £billions in fossil-fuel subsidy.\nI recall a Tour of Britain cycle event in 2019. The sponsor implied they were net-zero. I said that was truly impressive, given there’s a team of support vehicles following the cyclists – how did they manage it? “Well, net-zero is our aspiration,” was the answer, “we’re not there yet.” In other words, they lied.\nIf any politician talks about “beyond net-zero”, ask them what they’ve done. Not what their “values” or “aspirations” are. What they’ve actually delivered in their time in office.\nI launched our £18 million Green New Deal fund – investing in low carbon projects – giving organisations and communities access to capital to reduce their emissions now.\nWe’ve invested in skills. Building an army of green trades people. Heat-pump installers who can retrofit our homes. Mechanics who can fix our electric vehicles.\nIt’s why I negotiated long and hard with central Government to get control of our transport networks. To build a low-carbon transport system so good that thousands of people will voluntarily give up their cars. Fully integrating bus, Metro, network rail, along with bike hire and car clubs. Right across Tyne & Wear, Northumberland and County Durham.\nWe can’t rewind the clock to twenty years ago.\nWe can’t go back and plant the trees we should’ve planted then.\nWe can’t change the past.\nBut together, we can change the future, if we act now.\nIndeed – there’s no better time to do it.",

Expanding oil and gas production in the midst of the climate emergency. It’s not exactly ‘Beyond Petroleum’ is it?\nMore than 20 years after BP’s rebranding exercise everyone can see the greenwashing for what it always was: propaganda to pump more oil. Oil and gas giants are not going to ‘see the light’ and switch to renewables – and this Government isn’t going to make them.\nA Windfall Tax that allows fossil fuel companies to generate record profits during an energy price crisis is clearly not doing its job. The loopholes are large enough to sail an oil tanker through. It’s no wonder they are being taken advantage of – they get tax credits for opening up new gas and oil fields. Both BP and Shell were handed more money from the Government than they paid in tax every year between 2015 and 2020. (Except 2017 when Shell paid more than it received).\nYoung people get this injustice. On Wednesday I was at Newcastle Sixth Form College for a special youth version of Mayor’s Question Time. I’ve done loads of these events for adults. The principle is simple. I was directly-elected by the people, so the people get to speak with me directly. And that does mean all the people – I want to hear from you even if you were too young to vote in 2019 when I was first elected.\nClimate change is always one of the first topics young people raise with me. And they’re well informed. One asked me, “is it true that BP used to be publically owned?” Yes. The Thatcher government privatised it in stages between 1979 and 1987. That £23 billion could have been funding our public services. Or installing wind farms. Or reducing our bills. Or a mix of all that.\nI’m not surprised young people are so interested. It’s their future. In the 2060s my sons will be the same age as I am now. Unless we fix this, by then the North East coast will be under attack from rising sea levels. Blyth underwater. Jarrow and Gateshead regularly flooded.\nBut fix it how? Governments and global corporations won’t act. Individuals can feel powerless when fossil fuel giants heat our planet like some all-consuming Death Star.\nThat’s why our ‘Rebel Alliance’ brings together people and organisations that want to fight back against climate damage. Net Zero North East England is working for greener, cleaner, fairer region. And in the North of Tyne we’re at the heart of it with our investments in renewable energy, green skills, retrofit, schools and community projects. All underpinned by our Green New Deal Fund that makes money available to help charities, local businesses and public bodies decarbonise.\nIt’s an alliance in the best sense. Not just zero-carbon, but zero-poverty. A just transition to a green economy that leaves no one behind.\nHousing accounts for 34% of our greenhouse gas emissions. The North East has some of the oldest and leakiest buildings in Europe.\nWe know there are 140,000 homes in Newcastle, North Tyneside, and Northumberland that leak energy, because we’ve surveyed them. We know 84% of our homes are gas-heated. We need better insulation, and alternatives to fossil fuels for cooking and heating.\nBack in October I set our region’s entrepreneurs a challenge. With funding available for small local businesses that can find solutions.\nAnd from what I’ve seen so far, our region’s entrepreneurs are rising to that challenge. That’s why I’m excited to meet twenty one of those entrepreneurs on Valentine’s Day and see the products and processes they’ve developed.\nFree Flow Power can fit mini-hydro dynamos to residential pipes to generate electricity. Your very own personal turbine!\nBrightblue Studio have developed ‘skins’ to cover windows to reduce heat loss. Making a version of double-glazing affordable to large numbers of people.\nDragonfly Insulation have patented an easily applied gel insulation to make homes warmer and cheaper to heat.\nThe more I see of these ideas the more confident I am that the North East will be the beating heart of the Green Industrial Revolution – creating jobs and delivering the tools to dig us out of this hole.\nSo BP – stop digging.",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_the-bridge-tax-and-public-transport/content_102.html": "The Bridge Tax and Public Transport\nMarch 28, 2019\nThere are few sights more iconic than the bridges over the Tyne. They’re famous, and represent the ingenuity and industrial skill we’re known for. We should not be charging people to use them.\nWe have an air pollution problem, and it needs fixing. The government’s answer? To force local councils to put an extra charge on buses and taxis, but people who can afford new cars can drive for free. Like most Tory policies, this will hit the poorest, hardest.\nI am totally opposed to charging ordinary working people £12:50 a day for the Clean Air Zone. That’s £3000 a year to get to work!\nThe Tory government has known about this since 2011 when they were taken to court for breaking clean air standards. Instead of dealing with the problem, they fought against it in the courts for years. When they finally lost, they passed the buck to local councils. They even say in their ministerial edict, that political or economic objections shall not be taken into consideration. In other words, even though the people don’t want it, and local councils oppose it, the government will force it upon us.\nAlthough we can rarely see it, poor air quality is responsible for around 40,000 early deaths a year, including hundreds in Tyneside. There is no safe level of air pollution, and the effects build up over time. We do have to address this.\nThe answer is public transport. The Tories give London £4,155 per person for public transport funding. In the North East, we get just £855 per person.\nI’ll be working with our local councils to get proper funding to extend the Metro up to Blyth and Ashington, to extend the Metro to the west of Newcastle, and improve our rail services on the East Coast mainline. I know our Labour councils are keen to work with me on this.\nI’ll also introduce a joint ticketing system – where you can just tap in and tap out with your debit card, and it will calculate the best fare for your journey, whether you use buses, rail or Metro in your trip. It’ll speed up journeys – a bit – and save you money if you change buses or trains.\nAlong with a local app to track the buses and plan your route, this will boost public transport use. Where it’s been introduced in other cities, there’s been up to 40% increase in public transport use, taking cars off the road. It makes getting to work, college or a night out easier, and provides economic as well as environmental sustainability.",

Immediately. Or call the fire brigade. You wouldn’t say, “We don’t have the resources to fix this right now,” close the door, and pretend the problem will go away.\nYet this mindset gets wheeled-out to justify inaction over social challenges. Small issues are left to fester until they become huge problems – all in the name of saving a few quid. We’re told youth centres that steer young people away from crime are too expensive. But the money’s there to pay for young people in prison. We’re told helping isolated older residents stay independent is unaffordable. But we foot a bigger bill when they end up in A&E. We hear “savings must be found” from mentoring programmes for struggling parents. But we pay a lot more when a child ends up in care.\nOur community services are victims of this ideological delusion. It’s been going on for over a decade. Ever since bankers’ bonuses won out above children’s’ centres. The saddest thing is if we just did the compassionate thing, it would save us a fortune down the line.\nLast year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies reviewed the Sure Start scheme. They found it prevented over 13,000 hospitalisations of 11 to 15 year olds every year. These are kids who finished Sure Start at least 5 years earlier, but the benefits stayed with them. They had healthier immune systems and more robust mental health. Savings from this alone would pay for a third of the whole Sure Start scheme. Yet over 1,300 Sure Start centres were closed between 2010 and 2019.\nThe link between youth service funding and knife crime is almost mechanical – when one goes down, the other goes up. Young people face a greater risk of violence in places where there’s less support for them. Since 2012 budget cuts have forced the closure of 760 youth centres across England. David Cameron decided we’d have a Big Society instead.\nCommunity centres are not ‘nice to haves’. They are lifelines. We don’t need shiny new buildings. We need core funding for long term stability. Community hubs thrive on a network of long term relationships. These can’t thrive if the funding is under review every 12 months.\nThat’s why the North of Tyne Community Hubs policy prioritised strengthening networks where they already exist. We’ve invested £1.5 million into community-led work across Newcastle, North Tyneside, and Northumberland – delivering a promise I made in my election manifesto. A couple of weeks ago I visited the Children and Families Newcastle Hub in Benwell to see how the magic happens.\nIt’s based in the Carnegie Building, a grand old library on Atkinson Road. At a buzzing ‘stay and play’ session, surrounded by toddlers, local families told me how the centre had supported them during difficult lockdown months. Mary, a former midwife, said the hub had boosted the confidence of her 18-month-old granddaughter. Covid meant she hadn’t played with many other toddlers.\nThe NHS child health clinic runs in the next room, increasing participation rates. Upstairs people are practising on first aid dummies, and getting qualified for work. Another room hosts a training course for people learning to work in the security industry. An employment coaching agency runs from another room. As does Sidestep, a charity that undertakes patient – and successful – long-term work with young people vulnerable to exploitation.\nI was mid-thirties when my eldest was born. My wife and I both had good careers, good health, financial stability, and a supportive network of friends and family. And it was still exhausting. I heard the story of a young woman who’d struggled parenting her first child. She couldn’t cope, and her little one was taken into care. She spoke to people at the centre. She built mutual trust with the staff, and engaged with the groups. She opened up to other mothers who’d struggled and came to realise she wasn’t alone. She’s gone on to raise two more kids, one of whom is now studying at Oxford University.\nIf we want a better future, we must invest in people. Not close the door on them, and wait for the fire to spread.\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 21 March 2022",

If competition is allowed to run free, frolicking through the fields of wheat, then we all win. If a business does something bad, say neoliberals, consumers will stop buying their products – so there is no need for regulation. Markets, they claim, will self-regulate. If workers don’t like their job or their pay, they can get another one.\nDid you spot the flaw in the theory? That’s right: it’s bollocks. It does not correspond with reality. As a worker, quitting your job leaves you unemployed and trapped in debt. You get higher wages in the same job by using collective bargaining power. Which is why neoliberals hate trade unions.\nAs a consumer, you get no choice about which water company to use. It’s almost impossible to buy from only ethical companies. The bad ones spend a fortune on greenwash and brand identity.\nAccording to economic textbooks, companies make goods, sell the goods, then re-invest the profits. That still happens a bit – but like a mafia operation, the casino economy has muscled in, killing growth.\nRent seeking is where people get rich for owning something, despite doing nothing productive. Like the Private Finance Initiatives – PFI. Investment bankers stumped up the cash for £13 billion worth of hospitals. The National Audit Office calculated that public sector PFI repayments will cost us £199 billion until the 2040s. Too much NHS spending goes to billionaires instead of staff wages.\nShare buybacks are another financial trick. Profitable corporations could invest in research & development, staff training, or higher wages. Or use those profits to buy its own shares, and cancel them. With fewer shares left, the dividend per share increases, and so does the share price. CEOs and boards get paid more if share prices rise. BP, Shell, Amazon, Apple, Glencore, Qantus all do it.\nShareholders have netted £440 billion above inflation since 2008, while wages have fallen £510 billion below inflation.\nReal growth comes from investment in productive businesses. That’s our plan at the North of Tyne. Last Tuesday I visited Verisure at Quorum, near Four Lane Ends. They’re the first company I brought to the region. They make alarm and security systems and provide a real service people value. They look after their staff – now over 600 people.\nOn Thursday, I visited Thoughtworks – who we brought here last year. Their new office on Grey Street employs 36 people on good salaries, and will grow to 200. They make state of the art digital systems so everyone can benefit from the internet.\nWe need a national government that invests in people, not tax cuts. Better health. Better education. Eliminating poverty. Without skilled, healthy people with a good standard of living, there will be no growth. Austerity has wrecked growth and destabilised the public finances.\nWith the billionaire, their bank balance grows. With the engineer, the nation’s economy grows. With the craftsman who laid the bricks of the engineer’s house, the economy grows. With the teacher who educates the engineer’s kids, the economy grows. With the doctor who keeps the engineer and her family well, the economy grows. That’s real, robust, fair economic growth.",

Ask the Government. That’s how many people a recent report shows they’ve missed off the official jobless statistics from across the North East. It doesn’t include students, or retired people, or people raising kids full time or looking after a home.\nThey call them ‘economically inactive’. That’s an ugly phrase. We’re talking about people whose health is so poor they can’t work full time. Or without the training to get offered a job. Or who might struggle with their mental health. Or someone rejected from job applications so often one report describes them as “people who have given up”. So let’s not call them ‘economically inactive’ as if it’s a lifestyle choice. These are our fellow citizens in need of help.\nThis isn’t news, either. Not to people beyond the Westminster bubble. My team at the North of Tyne has been working on it since I was elected.\nIn 2019, Government set us a target to create 10,000 new jobs in 30 years. I’ve been Labour’s Metro Mayor for three and three-quarter years. By now we should have created a pipeline of 1,250 jobs. In fact our investment is directly creating 4,766 new jobs. Not bad against a backdrop of national economic upheaval. In fact, last year we were the number one region in England for job creation through inward investment.\nEvery week we’re adding to that total. On Thursday I spoke to a high-tech firm about increasing their job count from 27 to 160 over the next three years. How? By levering in private sector cash to create more jobs. It’s not all about taxpayer subsidy.\nSometimes politicians fetishize business. Some businesses are brilliant – they understand the value of looking after their workers. Some treat their workers appallingly. Some are terrible at paying their suppliers on time – a key issue for small businesses. Which is why I only work with ethical businesses.\nBecause there’s a difference between a job and a good job. Is it a real living wage? Is it secure? Does include training and development? Does the employer recognise trade unions? Are they building a diverse workforce?\nThis is where our Good Work Pledge comes in. A kitemark encouraging every employer in the region to be a good employer. We include it in our contracts with businesses. It now protects over 80,000 workers.\nThe local Hook Group – who own Blackfriars and other restaurants – were the first hospitality business to gain Advanced accreditation. They’ve proven that staff waiting tables and serving at a bar can be paid a living wage and looked after. We’ve become so accustomed to poor employment we accept it as routine. Time for that to end.\nLong term ill health will take time to reverse. But there is a direct correlation between poverty and ill health. I’m working with Sir Michael Marmot and his team to reduce our health inequalities by building a fairer economy. People with more money live longer, healthier lives.\nWe’re training people to get these jobs. We’re going beyond traditional college courses. Running bootcamps – free, flexible courses of up to 16 weeks, people can fit around childcare or shift work. Training for jobs in construction, culture, digital skills, HGV driving. And a guaranteed job interview with a local employer.\nOur skills programme leaves no one behind. Individual coaching and support for people with autism, and neurodiversity, and young people who’ve had a tough start in life. Adults with complex needs around mental illness and substance abuse.\nOur £2.25 million programme to train a ‘green army’ of new trades people to combat the climate crisis. Maintaining electric vehicles. Retrofitting houses. Installing heat pumps. The jobs of the future. I want them here, with local residents snapping them up.\nHere’s the question. If we’ve done so much so quickly, why has a Conservative Government that’s been in power for 13 years done so little? I think you know the answer. That’s why I spent meeting after meeting with ministers and pushed so hard for devolution across the North East.\nWe’ve had enough of being left behind by Westminster. We’ve proven devolution works. Let’s scale it up. Our people need it.",

If you use TransPennine Express you do.\nA week ago I made a statement with the other Northern Labour Mayors. Fragmentation, mismanagement and underinvestment are so severe that around half of all trains are cancelled. Transport spending in the north is just £349 per person. In London it’s £864. It’s no accident that our rail service is so poor.\nWithin half an hour Mark Harper, the new Secretary of State for Transport, emailed us all individually to ask for a meeting. This shows the power of Mayors working together.\nThe train companies are now negotiating with the RMT union without preconditions. I hope a sensible solution can be found that works for the long term sustainability of our rail system. That has to mean maintaining safety and service standards. I’ve always found train crews and station staff friendly and helpful and down to earth.\nRest day working needs sorting out. By law, train drivers have scheduled rest days – their version of a weekend. We can’t compromise safety by not allowing drivers time off.\nCompanies can negotiate Rest Day Working Agreements – supposedly to cover illness or supervise trainee drivers. But some Train Operating Companies are using them to cover staff shortages. TransPennine Express has lost over 60 drivers already this year but recruited about 50 to replace them. And they started the year with a driver shortage.\nYou don’t need a Masters Degree in Business Administration to see the answer: recruit more drivers.\nThe North East needs a public transport system that’s reliable, affordable, and pleasant to use. Our Local Authorities have come together to deliver exactly that.\nFrom 2nd January to 31st March, Metro fares will be capped at £2 for a single journey and £4 maximum daily fare if you use a Pop card. So if you’re travelling from Zones 2 or 3, that’s quite a saving. I use my Pop card all the time. Even in Zone 1, it costs £1.65 instead of £2.30. These savings add up.\nBus fares will also be capped at £2 from 2nd January until March 31st. Northern Labour Mayors pioneered this idea in Liverpool, West Yorkshire and Manchester.\nIn the North East, we want to go further. All across North East transport area – from Barnard Castle to Berwick – we intend to introduce a £1 fare cap for young people under 22. That will make a massive difference to young people travelling to college or work from our towns and villages. I was on BBC Radio Newcastle, and presenter Matt Bailey said when he lived in Stannington, his girlfriend lived in Widdrington and it cost him a fortune to see her. So we’re helping young love flourish!\nWe’re putting more staff on at public transport interchanges. People need to feel safe using stations when it’s dark, especially women and girls.\nThe Metro Flow project from Pelaw to South Tyneside will be completed before Christmas, improving reliability.\nNew, spacious Metro trains will be introduced early next year. They have electric steps to cover the gap, improving access for people with limited mobility. And unlike the privatised rail companies, we’re not paying a fortune to leasing companies – PFI on wheels. The Metro is publicly owned, and we’re buying them outright. That saves you, the passenger, money.\nWe’re reopening the Northumberland Line, from Ashington, Bedlington, through Blyth Bebside, Newsham, Seaton Delaval, Northumberland Park, Manors and Newcastle Central Station. That should open December 2023.\nWe’re in negotiations with Government to get transport devolved from May 2024. I’d like to see the transport system run as one. With real time information on a single app. Where one ticket covers you from rail, Metro, park & ride or bus. With secure bike parking and safe walking and cycle routes.\nBetter public transport creates a virtuous circle. As it gets better, more people use it. More passengers allows for lower fares. People can access jobs and education. It’s key to thriving economy, and reduces carbon emissions.\nThe contrast is clear. National Government and a fragmented, market-driven system is in chaos. Local and regional government gets things done.",

It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\nWAR IS PEACE\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH”\nGeorge Orwell’s 1984 was a work of fiction. Sadly, our political parties think it’s an instruction manual.\nSir Keir Starmer defended his position on the Israel/Hamas conflict, saying a ceasefire in Gaza could risk further violence. Really? Israeli war planes must drop more bombs in civilian areas or else civilians could get hurt? To think he used to brief the media to describe him as “forensic”.\nMr Sunak shares his position. He instructed the UK not to vote for the UN ceasefire motion. I doubt the families of the 3,760 children killed in Gaza would agree that dropping bombs on ambulances is saving lives. Listening to Sir Keir I could hear the party slogan from 1984 ringing in my ears – WAR IS PEACE.\nIn 1984, the Ministry of Love enforces loyalty to Big Brother through fear, using a massive apparatus of security and repression. Cue Suella Braveman. She said protesting in favour of a ceasefire is a hate crime. You don’t have to have said or done anything hateful, she just knows you are. Thoughtcrime.\nShe’s introduced new anti-protest laws. In March we saw peaceful anti-monarchy protesters arrested in London and held in cells for 16 hours. Despite having police agreement to protest. When asked if Labour would repeal the act, none of the shadow cabinet or Labour Police and Crime Commissioners would commit to this. But what do we expect? In 1984 FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.\nLast week Mr Sunak sacked Conservative MP Paul Bristow as a ministerial aide for calling for a ceasefire.\nSir Keir removed the whip from Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald. A man I know to be principled and hardworking and a consistent campaigner for peace. His crime? Calling for peace and a two-state solution in the middle east. His exact words? “We won’t rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis & Palestinians, between the river & the sea can live in peaceful liberty.”\nIn case you don’t know, Hamas believes Israel has no right to exist, from the river to the sea. The founding document of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Likud Party says, “Between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.” In other words, Palestine has no right to exist. Between these two opposing extremist views, Andy McDonald proposed an alternative – living together in peaceful liberty.\nHis words were wilfully ripped out of context and misrepresented. And Sir Keir suspended him. Thoughtcrime. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. After all, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\nOur world is not so dystopian as 1984. For a start, no one believes our Big Brother party leaders. They are not beheld in fear, but in contempt. Even by their own party members.\nI’ve spoken to literally hundreds of people in the past few weeks. No one trusts the main parties. One woman told me, “They know they’re lying. Like toddlers with chocolate around their mouths, denying everything, when you can see the wreckage of the advent calendar behind them.”\nOrwell explained their behaviour as cognitive dissonance reduction. “CRIMESTOP… includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protective stupidity.”\nMany think that with first-past-the-post, Westminster is a write-off. If you want to change our politics, you could start by electing an independent Mayor in the North East. One with a proven track record of achievement. Who works cross-party to get things done. Independents have no Big Brother party leader. No thought police who can threaten to remove the whip.\nAfter all, Westminster increasingly looks like Orwell’s Animal Farm. “The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.”",

Thatcherism destroyed 248,000 jobs in the region. My Dad’s included. Steelworks, wagon works, and of course, the mines. GDP per capita plummeted from 93% of the national average in 1981 to 73% by 2017. No other English region suffered this decline.\nEven today our productivity is too low, and our healthy life expectancy is the worst in England. Widespread deprivation goes hand-in-hand with the lowest levels of asset ownership.\nBut the idea that we’ve always been poor is a myth.\nThroughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the North East had a higher GDP per person than the South East, South West, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber.\nThe home of the locomotive, the birthplace of the railways, the supplier of ships to the world. The place where renewable energy, electric light and turbine power were invented.\nWe weren’t left behind then. We were at the forefront of the industrial revolution.\nNow, as we grapple with the climate emergency, the world is going to build wind turbines and electric vehicles. And I want them built here in the North East.\nAs North of Tyne Mayor I’ve invested £40 million in our green industries, creating jobs and prosperity. Our offshore wind sector is thriving and the Energy Central Learning Hub in Blyth is creating the career pathways for tomorrow’s engineers.\nNow imagine what we can do with twice the people and twice the budget.\nOur people are still strong, proud and friendly. Shared adversity has led to shared resilience. “We are still here” despite the setbacks.\nAnd we have real advantages that could pave the way for a brighter future.\nOur unique combination of city, coast and countryside offers a range of great places to live, work and bring up families.\nCities that bring together diverse and vibrant communities.\nA coast that provides great days at the beach but also the gateway to the offshore renewable energy industry.\nA countryside that feeds our bellies and our imagination. Food and forests. Farming and fitness.\nWe can be the first region to enact a Green New Deal. Using offshore wind to power the transition to cheap energy and clean air. Building warmer homes and retrofitting existing housing stock.\nFunding a richer cultural life for everyone to enjoy. Places and activities where our young people can find their voice and tell their stories. Where they learn to be proud citizens.\nWe can be the first region to have a Total Transport Network that integrates buses, trains, Metro, bikes and car clubs. With capped fares and free travel for under-19s and students.\nWe can be the first region to provide a good job for everyone who wants one and the careers pathway to get people the skills needed. The single most transformational action a Mayor could take. Parents will no longer have to raise their kids in poverty. Crime will fall. Health inequalities will close.\nWe can do all of this and more. But only if we vote for it.\nIf humanity could put a man on the Moon 55 years ago then we surely have the means to build a better North East today.\nI’m not running for North East Mayor because it’s easy. I’m doing it because it’s hard.",

But what about a skills bootcamp? No sweat or tears involved, and instead of losing weight, you gain skills. Employable skills to help you find work or a better paid job. We’ve put £322k in to our first round of bootcamps. We’re training up people for rail engineering, logistics and digital technology.\nSkills and education are drivers of economic prosperity. Along with good physical and mental health, they create a virtuous circle. People with money left over at the end of the month are more resilient. Over time, they are healthier. And kids from households with higher incomes go on to higher educational attainment. But too many people are not in this loop – caught instead in the vicious circle of long hours, low pay, mounting debt, and increasing stress.\nWe’re building an economy based on good work, with a foundation of well paid and secure green jobs. We know everyone needs to benefit. That’s why we’ve got a strategic skills plan in place. No one should be stuck in unemployment or a dead-end job with blunted life opportunities.\nThe North of Tyne has a devolved Adult Education Budget of £24 million a year. In our first year we got 28,800 people enrolled in formal training courses – 70% of whom were previously unemployed.\nBecause we control the fund, we have flexibility. When central government controlled it, there was a hit-and-miss approach to what worked. We’ve increased enrolments by over 10% on the same budget – not bad during a pandemic when buildings were closed for months at a time.\nLearning new skills can be daunting for people – especially older workers. So we provide wrap-around support to boost new learners’ confidence. We’re funding programmes close to the people who need support. Catering and food hygiene training with the Cedarwood Trust in North Shields. Language and IT skills with Action Foundation in Newcastle, who support refugees. And Forward Assist in Dudley are helping armed forces veterans transition into civilian employment.\nBut I’m battling with the Department of Education (DfE) to keep this local flexibility. The new Skills and Post-16 Education Bill going through Parliament wants to have a central register. So we’ll only be able to fund projects through providers who DfE have vetted – with extra costs and months of delays.\nOur local knowledge reaches people who most need support. Our DiversityNE project, in partnership with the North East Autism Society, helps people with neurodiversity. One-to-one employment support, in-work support, and support from peers with similar conditions is making a huge difference to people’s lives.\nOur Northern Directions programme, with Groundwork North East, helps 16-24 year olds through coaching and mentoring from a youth worker. They develop an individual action plan to overcome what may have been a terribly difficult start in life.\nOur Get Ahead Project, with Changing Lives, helps anyone over 18 facing complex barriers to unemployment. Everyone is different. Some people might be homeless, or a have been through the criminal justice system. Others might struggle with substance dependency. In all cases this is compounded by financial exclusion – employers are unlikely to hire someone without a bank account. One-to-one tailored support helps people get employment placements and find a route into work, bringing self-esteem and the hard cash that comes with working for a living.\nAs a society we have a choice. We can write people off, or we can help them stand on their own two feet. I say we help people. No one gets left behind because they’ve been dealt a poor hand by life.\nI’ve written about projects helping the most vulnerable. But we’re helping everyone – including our £2 million Green Growth Skills fund, and our digital skills programmes for people changing careers. Our Working Homes works with tenants in social housing, 1,425 tenants have accessed learning and skills so they can earn more. And the £430k we’ve put into Union Learn helps people already in work get additional training and new qualifications, which benefits both them and their employers.\nWhen one person becomes more skilled, more educated, the whole of society benefits.\n*Originally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 21st February 2022",

According to them, “the government froze Durham out of a key transport fund” that will cause “two-tier devolution”.\nThis is 100% untrue, and they know it is untrue. This goes beyond spin, it is outright deception.\nThe background and history in Durham\nIn my 2019 manifesto I promised I’d work to get transport devolution for the whole North East. I worked for years to secure that deal – now worth £6.1 billion to the region – it’s the best funded devolution deal in the country. Durham was originally part of the negotiations from 2020. They then chose to negotiate their own deal in 2021. Government said they would not get transport money if they did that, so in mid-2022 I proposed they rejoin the rest of the region.\nIn August 2022 Durham Labour leader Carl Marshall launched a campaign to stop Durham joining the North East deal. He approached all the Labour council leaders asking them to block Durham. He campaigned against it on social media. He even told council leaders that Durham County Council would reject the deal, because independents would vote with him.\nI persuaded government ministers to leave the door open for Durham. But after Carl Marshall’s campaign, I had a hell of a battle with the Labour council leaders to persuade them to let Durham back in. In the end it was agreed that Durham could join, but the other Labour leaders insisted that Durham should not get part of the first £475 million of transport money. After that, Durham gets its full share of all future transport investment – including all the new money coming from the cancellation of the HS2 northern leg. This only applies to capital investment, by the way. Durham still gets its share of bus revenue support and pothole money from day 1.\nDurham County Council was absolutely right to join with the rest of the North East. Without it they would be getting no new transport money at any time. In the North East we’re sick of Westminster politicians lying to us. Now we’re being deceived by a Mayoral candidate parachuted in by London Labour HQ. No wonder trust in politicians is so low.\nParagraph 110 of the North East Devolution Deal states unequivocally that spending decisions are made by the new Mayor in conjunction with the council leaders, not by central Government. If Ms McGuinness wants Durham to get its share of the £475 million, she needs to oppose the local council leaders.\nMy transport plans if re-elected\nIf I’m re-elected in May, this time as North East Mayor, I’ll begin work on day 1 to integrate buses, trains and Metros. I’ll lever in funding for the Leamside Line. I’ll start building a Total Transport Network that covers rural areas. I’ll also make travel free for 18s and under.",

We had all just been encouraged to ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ by Rishi Sunak. A disastrous policy that increased infections and prolonged the pandemic.\nAt the same time millions of children were going hungry and no party leaders were speaking up for them. Enter Marcus Rashford. For a brief moment in 2020 the Manchester United footballer was the ‘adult in the room’ in British politics, writing this on Twitter:\n‘Put aside all the noise, the digs, the party politics and let’s focus on the reality. A significant number of children are going to bed tonight not only hungry but feeling like they do not matter because of comments that have been made today. We must stop stigmatising, judging and pointing fingers. Our views are being clouded by political affiliation. This is not politics this is humanity. We talk about the devastating impact of COVID-19 but, if projections are anything to go by, child food poverty has the potential to become the greatest pandemic the country has ever faced.’\nSadly, Mr Rashford’s predictions are coming true. In 2022 4.2 million children (29% of all UK children) were in poverty – up from 3.6 million in 2010-11. And 190,000 of those children are right here in the North East.\nKeeping children in poverty damages individuals and families. It also leaves deep long-term scarring on our economy.\nLast week the North East Child Poverty Commission published a major report into the scale of the challenge here. It made for sober reading. But there were some glimmers of hope and an ambitious blueprint for change.\nThe report made it clear that the main levers of power are still in the hands of Westminster politicians. But that shouldn’t stop us deploying the power we have regionally through Mayoral Combined Authorities, local councils and third sector organisations. In other words, let’s not wait for central Government to save us – or we might be waiting a long time.\nWhen I was elected as North of Tyne Mayor in 2019, I spoke about creating a zero poverty, zero carbon region. Five years later and we have made some major strides towards that goal. With 5,377 new full-time, permanent jobs against a government target of 1,666. I’ve increased adult education enrolments from 22,000 to 35,000. I’ve declared a climate emergency, invested heavily in our offshore wind sector and launched an £18 million Green New Deal Fund. We’re helping build over 2,133 new homes on brownfield sites with eco and affordable housing. And we are delivering a ground-breaking Child Poverty Prevention Programme. I’ve achieved all this without putting a penny on your council tax bill.\nWe are the only Combined Authority in the country using our investment fund to tackle child poverty. Why is this important? Because the good jobs of tomorrow are not going to be taken up by kids who are too hungry to learn today.\nIn 2021 I launched our Child Poverty Prevention Programme. It aims to poverty proof the school day and offer welfare advice to parents. We helped one family in Wallsend recover over £11,000 in back benefits they were owed for their disabled child. To date we have helped families recover over £1 million in unclaimed welfare payments. The North East Child Poverty Commission is spot on when they talk about the importance of ‘maximising family incomes.’ This is exactly what we’re doing at the North of Tyne. When I negotiated £6.1 billion for the region, I made sure that our child poverty prevention work was ‘baked-in’ to the devolution deal, so that we can ramp-up this work and help more families across the North East.\nSadly the elephant in the room is the Government’s cruel two-child benefit cap. A policy that plunged 45,000 North East kids into poverty – enough to fill the Stadium of Light. Research has shown that this policy has impoverished families rather than increase employment. The day I left the Labour Party was the same day Sir Keir Starmer announced Labour would keep this inhumane policy. We should challenge every Labour candidate in every election to disown it.\nThere is much we can do with devolution, as we have already shown. But we cannot ignore the fact that we need the next government, be it Labour or Conservative, to remove the two-child benefit cap and properly fund our local councils. It makes me furious that both Labour and Conservatives are committed to keeping children in poverty. Anything less would be a betrayal of our region’s future.\nAs Marcus Rashford said, ‘This is not politics, this is humanity.’",

Combined Authority Mayors are the exception. Our cabinets comprise the leaders and deputies from each constituent council. I’m looking forward to welcoming the new North of Tyne Cabinet Members, regardless of party.\nDespite the narrative about a Labour collapse in the North East, Labour stands strong in the North of Tyne. There hasn’t been a Conservative elected in Newcastle since 1992. In North Tyneside, Labour still dominates the council with 51 seats out of 60, up from 48. Labour’s Norma Redfearn was re-elected with an overwhelming mandate as Borough Mayor. Rural Northumberland stayed under Conservative control literally by luck of the draw. Two seats were tied, and results decided by pulling the winner out of the ballot box. Interestingly, two new Green councillors have been elected in Northumberland.\nI’m a democratic socialist, and I place democracy on equal footing with socialism. If there’s one thing this election shows us, it’s that devolution is on the agenda. Scottish and Welsh incumbent parties have done well, as have Metro Mayors across the north. In a poll for the Centre for Cities, 83% of people said they wanted their mayor to have more devolved powers and budgets.\nThe Combined Authority exists to bring good, well-paid jobs here. To improve skills. To enable people to re-skill and change their career if they want to. And to close the prosperity gap, which we can see every time we walk along any of our high streets.\nTo do that, we need to spend money. And we’re doing that in a highly effective, targeted way. £9 million on regeneration projects like the Shields Ferry landing, repair of the Protection Jetty surrounding the Fish Quay, and redevelopment of three housing sites in North Shields. £10 million on our Recovery Innovation Fund. This includes vouchers to help businesses adapt and utilise new technologies, innovations in tourism, and projects to adapt underused places and spaces.\nWe’re not just focusing on work. We’ve a rich history of culture and creativity. We’re working with Creative England and spending £3.25 million on a North of Tyne Culture and Creative Recovery Programme which starts this month.\nDealing with the climate emergency is a priority for me. We’re putting over £4 million into clean energy. Our North of Tyne Offshore Infrastructure Fund is preparing the facilities to bring green jobs to the Port of Blyth, and the iconic site of Swans Energy Park – formerly the old Swan Hunter shipyard.\nWe’re driving innovation in green jobs with our £10 million Green New Deal Fund. These projects will directly reduce carbon emissions and create skilled jobs. This Green New Deal positions us a national leader.\nNext week I’m signing the steel at the construction of NUCastle – the new youth centre we’re funding near St James’s. In with the £2.6 million funding is the money to run outreach programmes, using sports to help young people improve their education and job prospects.\nWe’ve got world-class brains and universities here. We’re investing £5 million in partnership with the National Innovation Centre for Ageing, turning that world-class R&D into jobs and start-up businesses. And another £10 million with the National Innovation Centre for Data creating jobs and innovation with local digital businesses.\nOn top of all of this, we’re delivering a North of Tyne Poverty Truth Commission. This anchors our work in the real lives and challenges of some of our most vulnerable citizens. We’ll be delivering the recommendations from our Citizens’ assembly on Climate Change. Rolling out our Community Hubs programme. Establishing our festivals & events programme once Covid is over. And funding our inward investment programme to attract firms to set up here.\nIn total we’re spending £59m, creating more than 4,310 new jobs. Regardless of the election results, all of the Cabinet will work together, roll up our sleeves and crack on with the job. Supported by the amazing Combined Authority staff team we’ve built from scratch over the past two years. Our task is to create a zero-carbon, zero-poverty North of Tyne.\nTrain the people. Create the jobs. Generate the wealth.\nOriginally published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 10 May 2021",

In the absence of any leadership from Matt Hancock, Michael Gove or Boris Johnson, the North East’s Covid cases were doubling every week. Our local public health teams identified the transmission hotspots and asked central government to bring in some limited restrictions.\nThis isn’t a lockdown like it was in March. Pubs and cafes are still open, they just close at 10pm. You can buy things in shops. People can still go to work. If these measures don’t work, central government will impose a stricter lockdown.\nChildcare is really expensive, and many families rely on grandparents and other relatives to look after their kids. School pick-ups, in particular are vital. Yet without any consultation, the Conservative government chose to make informal childcare illegal. I’ve written, along with all the local council leaders, insisting that this be reversed.\nNo wonder people are confused when Dominic Cummings is allowed to drive with his family across the entire country while he’s infected. But it’s now illegal for you to babysit your own family members\nWhat we need is for people to look after themselves and other people. Read the FAQ published online. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Wear a mask to help others – you don’t know if that person near you has asthma or not. Most importantly, keep 2 metres away from people.\nThe philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, ‘What does not kill me makes me stronger’. Well not with Covid. Even if you’re young and healthy, Covid can ruin your life. Patients who’ve caught Covid and recovered can still be left with damage to their heart muscles. The Lancet is reporting kidney and joint damage. Numerous studies are showing Covid causes damage to the cells of the brain and central nervous system. I was talking to a doctor, who reported that an increasing number of cases are dragging on and on, with people not recovering for months. Patients talk of being in a “brain fog” and unable to think clearly. Covid hasn’t been around long enough for us to know for certain how much your lifespan will shorten, even if you recover.\nBut two key components have been missing for too long. First, testing. Unless we can quickly and reliably tell who’s got the disease, we’re acting blindfolded. The omnishambles that has been the national testing and tracing system prompted a local response. Central government have finally got round to agreeing to give us the resources to run our own testing system. The Lighthouse Lab will be run between our hospitals and Local Authorities, and clear the backlog of tests.\nAnd after I and others have been asking for months, government has finally realised that people who are skint will only self-isolate if they get financial support. Low paid workers will now get £500 to make up for their earnings loss when self-isolating. This should have been introduced back in March.\nHealth and wealth are interlinked. Dealing with Covid is an immediate problem, but we’ve endured poor health in our region for too long. We have the lowest life expectancy of all English regions, especially for women.\nParents are working, but they can’t afford to put food on the table for their kids. Almost three-quarters of the children in the North East are living in families with no or very little savings. They have no financial cushion to help them through.\nThat’s why all the jobs we’re creating in the North of Tyne are underpinned by our Good Work Pledge. Jobs need to be secure, pay enough to live on, and give people career progression.\nI’m so pleased that the North of Tyne Combined Authority has a zero gender pay gap. On that note, hats off to Sunderland City Council who’ve joined us as an accredited Real Living Wage employer. This will make a massive difference to the lives of thousands of keyworkers in our region, and their families.\nYour local authorities don’t have anything like the funding or the powers that central government have. But what they do have, they use wisely, to protect you and your loved ones.\nPublished Originally in The Journal and Evening Chronicle 21.9.20",
  "https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_/https_jamiedriscoll_co_uk_news_devolution-is-about-democracy/content_169.html": "Devolution is About Democracy\nJuly 7, 2020\nI was listening to radio last week, and on came Michael Heseltine, bigging-up Metro Mayors. He name-checked our work in Newcastle.\nIt’s a funny feeling for a Labour politician, getting praised by a Tory grandee. It’s heartening to have your good work recognised. It’s good in electoral terms. An opposition politician saying you’re doing a good job proves your competence. But you have to wonder what your own party members think!\nThe gist of Lord Heseltine’s interview was that decisions are better made by locally-elected Mayors than in Westminster. He called on us Metro Mayors to come forward with coherent, strategic plans to stimulate and improve our local economies. Music to my ears. It’s what I’m doing already.\nI spoke to Hezza last year, when he’d written his report, Empowering English Cities. It’s worth a read, even if you only look at the 20 recommendations. We agreed on everything to do with devolution. I said, “Michael, I never thought I’d find myself agreeing with the Tory Deputy Prime Minister. The man who closed the pits.” He laughed, and said, “When it comes to tidying up a bomb site, it doesn’t matter which dead economist you agree with.”\nSo what’s devolution all about? For most people, politics isn’t particularly engaging at the best of times. Constitutional reform is unlikely to inspire many chart topping protest songs. But it should. It’s about taking back control. It’s about democracy.\nI lead something called a Mayoral Combined Authority. The three local authorities of Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland are constituent members. They keep their independence – I’m not the boss of them. I don’t manage the bins or the libraries or the social services.\nThere’s a long history of Britain being run based on what works for London and the South East. Now we get to decide what works better for us.\nBudgets that were previously controlled in Whitehall now get devolved to the Combined Authority. It’s not an extra layer of government, it’s moving the decision making to the places they affect. And we manage everything we do with just 34 staff.\nWe get £20 million a year to invest as we decide. It’s not much compared to the £14 billion a month the furlough scheme costs. But already we’ve created hundreds of jobs. We’re investing in developing the offshore wind industry. We’re helping kids without computers get online to do their schoolwork.\nWe’ve taken control of the adult education budget. That’s £23 million a year we’re using to fund the training opportunities for the people who live here.\nWe’ve just secured £24 million for brownfield housing. That allows us to build new houses without encroaching on the green belt. We have loads of old heavy-industry sites where the land needs improving. It will allow us to unlock a range of those sites across the North of Tyne. That means more affordable housing.\nWe’ve got a school improvement strategy. A programme to develop local festivals. We’re working to decarbonise our economy. When it comes to giving out public contracts, we’re prioritising local firms. We’re getting citizens directly involved, via a Citizens Assembly.\nTogether this adds up to more jobs, and more decisions involving local people.\nThis is just a start. In the Budget in March, the Government announced we’d get our share of £4.2 billion transport funding if we unite as a region. That means Metro line extensions, and improved bus services. We’re waiting for sign-off for our £10 million a year schools challenge budget. This will get us mental health support in every school. It means better support for our teachers.\nLater this year, government will publish a White Paper on Devolution. This forms the basis of upcoming legislation. I’m negotiating to bring more investment and decision making to the North East.\nDevolution means these decisions aren’t made by anonymous Whitehall mandarins. Or unelected Special Advisors. They’re made by me, in consultation with other people who live here. Who use the same Metro as you do. Whose families use the same services and live in the same communities. And above all, decisions made by a Mayor who you get to elect.\nPublished in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 6.7.20",

It was time to head out on my bike for the opening of Shieldfield Art Works (SAW) community garden. A week of back-to-back meetings was taking its toll and my energy levels were on the low side. The fact that it was chucking it down didn’t help.\nThat all evaporated with the warm welcome I received. Rev Alison Wilkinson has pastoral oversight of SAW, previously known as The Holy Biscuit (which brought to mind 1970’s Batman). It was one of those places and events which inspires and energises.\nWhat had been a patch of grass next to a car park is transformed into a flourishing community garden. A green, wildlife-friendly oasis in the heart of a busy urban area. The North of Tyne match-funded their crowdfunder, so they could afford tools and trees, and they’d invited me to come and celebrate it.\nThere’s a wild-flower meadow, raised vegetable beds and fruit trees. I recognised some Red Windsor apples – I grow them in my own garden, they’re crunchy, delicious and grow well in our climate. There’s space for gatherings and for contemplation, a cooking area for socialising. Together, they make a common ground for growing new friendships, building a sense of community in the middle of a dense urban area. There was a real buzz about the place, and it wasn’t just the bees. People shared food and swapped tips on growing veg and fruit, kids ran around playing, safe from traffic.\nThere’s also the outdoor gallery, “PROCESS” – seven large-scale posters on the outside of the SAW building. They describe it as “a form of protest in order to laugh at power, talk back and weep out loud.” Lydia Hiorns the Programme Manager, told me how growing food as a communal activity builds local solidarity and raises understanding of climate change.\nThe project works seamlessly with the local cooperative, Dwellbeing Shieldfield, and there a weekly gardening group. Lots of local residents live in flats and have no garden. Some are older residents, who enjoy a garden without having to do the heavy digging and weeding. Others are refugees, from Iraq, Iran, Syria and Sudan.\nI chatted to a young couple with two small children, newly arrived in the UK as refugees and now placed in a local hotel. I watched their smiles as they spoke of the welcome and hospitality they had received at the garden. It’s given them new hope and boosted their children’s happiness and confidence. Five years of instability since escaping Iran had taken its toll.\nFiona, who’s lives in Shieldfield for donkey’s years, described how much she enjoys hearing the stories of new friends from different countries and cultures, and how she relaxes in the garden with a new perspective on the world.\nAnd there’s plans to grow beyond the community garden. In the centre’s workshop space, a wall-sized map of Shieldfield catches your eye. It’s no ordinary map, but an imagining of Shieldfield as a “garden of edible ideas.” Dr Mikey Tomkins is a specialist in urban agriculture and greening innovation. He invited residents to imagine how the multitude of hidden and public spaces in Shieldfield could be repurposed for growing food and as green spaces.\nIt’s an ambitious idea, and Dr. Mikey stresses it’s a concept, not a polished plan. But we’re seeing more of this across the North of Tyne. Nearby in Newcastle there’s Greening Wingrove in Fenham, and in Heaton back-lanes are bursting into colour with flowers and fruit trees, all supported by the North of Tyne. There’s loads more – Hexham, Heaton, Byker, Whitley Bay, Scotswood, Cresswell and Meadow Well. If you want to do something in your area, Google “Crowdfund North of Tyne”.\nAfter speeches, food and music, it was time to plant some climbers. The clouds parted and evening sunshine broke through. Rev Alison must be well connected. I rolled up my sleeves and a new honeysuckle is twining its way up an archway.\nIt had been a long day, and getting late, but thoughts of an “edible city” made my cycle home a doddle. When people come together like this, inspiring things happen.\nOriginally printed in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 4 July 2022",

The unsung heroes of the public sector, the thousands of council workers who provide the vital services that keep our communities running.\nLocal government workers have always been there for us. From cradle to grave, they are the glue that holds our communities together. We often don’t notice what council workers do, but they are there, making our lives better. And never more so than in this public health crisis.\nThey collect our rubbish and keep the streets and parks clean. They look after us in our homes when we’re vulnerable. They make sure we have a roof over our heads when the very idea of a home seems impossible. They help parents provide a positive environment for their kids. They support vulnerable children, including kids in need of care, by working with families, children’s homes and foster carers.\nThey are keeping schools open and feeding the children of keyworkers. They keep social care going, now a huge challenge because of social distancing and self-isolation requirements.\nIt’s our council public health teams who are at the forefront of keeping the spread of the virus under control.\nFront line staff need back room support. Managers are redesigning services to meet the new demands with a faction of the resources they need. Ten years of austerity has left over-stretched and hollowed-out departments. This is now compounded with the need to keep staff safe, working from home where possible.\nAnd coming up with new measures to help victims of domestic abuse. Economic abuse is a major component of abusive relationships. With incomes cut and lockdown in place, we’ve seen domestic abuse increase worldwide. Sadly, there is no reason to think that this pattern will be avoided here.\nKim McGuiness, our Police and Crime Commissioner, has set up a fund to help charities & community groups increase their capacity. You can find the link on www.northumbria-pcc.gov.uk.\nThousands are stepping up as volunteers. If you want to help, you can coordinate through your local authority. North Tyneside has the Covid-19 hub. Newcastle has the CItyLife Line. Northumberland has Northumberland Communities Together. If you want to volunteer, go to their websites. Volunteers are offering practical help – shopping for food, calling and listening to people who may be on their own, or providing transport.\nOur three North of Tyne councils are also working flat-out to support businesses hit by the crisis. Many businesses are eligible for grants of between £10k and £25k.\nAs of 2nd April, Newcastle City Council have paid out over £15 million to help over 1,000 small businesses. In Northumberland, 2,500 businesses have applied to their Covid-19 Business Hub. North Tyneside Council is running similar schemes. See your Local Authority website for details. There’s a full rundown of available help on www.northeastgrowthhub.co.uk.\nMy team are working in partnership to coordinate the regional economic response. This includes repurposing production – such as making hand sanitiser or ventilator components. We’re part of the new North East COVID-19 Economic Response Group. This is a partnership of the North of Tyne, NECA, the CBI, the North East Local Enterprise Partnership and the trade unions.\nIt’s heartening to see the respect and gratitude being shown to the NHS staff. My wife is frontline GP. I’m all too aware that the scandalous shortage of personal protective equipment is putting staff at risk. Doctors and nurses are contracting the virus and dying because of this failure. I know for certain that the failure to make tests available has hampered the NHS.\nThe Thursday “clap for the NHS” and outpourings of solidarity have been very moving. This crisis is bringing out the best in many people. When I’m clapping, I’m doing it for all the keyworkers, in all sectors. They deserve our support.\nThey also deserve our support when this crisis is over. I will fight alongside them to ensure our public services are properly funded. Austerity has taken our public sector to breaking point and made us ill-prepared for this emergency. It must be discarded as the disgraced policy it is.\nFirst published in the Journal and Evening Chronicle 6. 4. 20"
