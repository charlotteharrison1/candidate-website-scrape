I care about our region.\nWe have been overlooked for too long, and I will champion our home and fight our corner.\nI spent my early years in Hull, and I was educated in Willerby at Wolfreton School. I brought my daughter up here in Beverley.\nI grew up enjoying everything that Hull and East Yorkshire had to offer: days out on the beach at Bridlington and the excitement of Hull Fair every October.\nThis is such special place and I’m proud to call it my home.\nBut I also know the challenges we face. From struggling local services to the need for more good jobs, it’s time for change.\nThis election is about more than just leadership—it’s about opportunity.\nIt’s about delivering a brighter future for Hull and East Yorkshire, where no one is left behind.\nI’m standing on 1 May because I care about our home - and I will always put Hull and East Yorkshire first.\nPrivacy: https://labour.org.uk/privacy/\nMargaret Pinder © 2024\nWe need your consent to load the translations\nWe use a third-party service to translate the website content that may collect data about your activity.
