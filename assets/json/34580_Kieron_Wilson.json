So during this period you have to take whatever little victories and joys you can and last week there was a fantastic one. It was announced that the BCP Council would be part of the new cohort of the What Works Community ran by the Centre for Homelessness Impact. CHI are an incredible organisation whose objective is to use evidence and data to bring about a sustainable end to homelessness.\nI first encountered the Centre for Homelessness Impact at Housing 2019, when I went to a seminar in which the Chief Executive, Ligia Teixeria, gave a brilliant presentation on the work being done by the organization. Ever since I have used their website as a resource. I think there are similarities between the council and CHI, we are new, bright, innovative organisations with a passion to end homelessness. At the back end of last year we joined CHI and Cardiff University in a smaller research project that looked at what we did over the course of the first lockdown with the intention of improving the outcomes of those we were providing services to, which is still on going.\nHomelessness and all it encompasses has often been a subject that has been overlooked when it comes to studying and understanding it, particularly when it comes to policy making. The work they do is so vital. That is why one of my last acts as the Cabinet Member for Housing was to write to the Chief Executive of the Council to get authorisation to be part of the What Works Community scheme.\nSpanning the fields of behavioural insights, design thinking and data-informed decision making, the programme supports local authorities to develop a culture of continuous innovation, and enhance their ability to use evidence and data to tackle homelessness by focusing on ‘what works’ – https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/community\nBy being a part of this it places Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole quite literally on the map in terms of being a leader in homeless services, but also enables the council to feed into the evidence base that will decide future policy, and that is vital. Although there has been a change of administration, there doesn’t seem yet to have been a change in direction in the approach to homelessness, which is positive and a credit to the new lead on homelessness. Though I will be keeping a close eye to make sure we continue to head in the right direction, I think the administration understand the great work we were doing in housing and homelessness (below are a list of some of the Key successes we had over the last 12 months) and know it would be foolish to divert course.\nThe last few months have been odd for me, after losing my role as Cabinet Member for Housing, especially when it wasn’t for doing a poor job, which would have been much easier to accept. I went from a not having any time to myself, to nearly only having time to myself, though that soon changed again. I am still doing a lot of work in the ward, helping businesses receive their discretionary grants, sorting disputes out between residents and the council on many different subjects, going to every sub-group of the Homelessness Partnership under the sun and so much more.\nTomorrow I will be in attendance at the final All Party Parliamentary Group on Ending Homeless listening to some of my heroes in the sector explain to a panel Co-Chaired by Bob Blackman MP and Neil Coyle MP, about what needs to be done to eradicate homelessness within the country, which I am really excited about. Yet it still isn’t that same intensity as to when I was in the hot-seat.\nAnd in many ways I am grateful for that, it has been the first time I’ve been able to take some time out in a very challenging year and half, and -pun absolutely intended- I have been able to do what works for me to get through a tough time.\nKey successes\n• Overall reduction in Rough Sleeping across the conurbation\n• 1215 households prevented from homelessness in past 12 months\n• The Homeless Reduction Board and Homelessness Partnership launched. Over 60 organisations and services are involved with well over 100 individuals, with several focussed Action Groups.\n• The launch of the Homelessness Forum, increasing opportunities for collaboration, communication and consistent working.\n• Successful Let’s Talk Renting campaign to encourage early action in terms of prevention. This was a multi-agency approach to ensure maximum reach and success and is now being followed up by a Let’s Talk Money campaign.\n• A new Hospital Homeless Pathway team has been launched to provide better support and outcomes for people in hospital who are at risk of homelessness upon discharge. This multidisciplinary team includes housing, and this followed a pilot funded initially by the MHCLG Cold Weather Fund.\n• The BCP response to the Everyone In initiative during the Covid-19 pandemic has been recognised as very successful. This recognition belongs to all of the many agencies who were, and remain, part of this effort delivering collaborative support in health, substance dependency and food provision to just name a few examples.\n• Over 300 individuals placed in Emergency Accommodation as part of Everyone In, with more than 80 moved on to longer term accommodation.\n• Everyone who has been placed in emergency accommodation has had a thorough assessment of their housing, health and support needs, as part of ensuring that the best solutions are found for everyone.\n• A multi-agency Rough Sleeping Pathway has been a vital part of this approach, with an integrated working approach with various agencies working alongside the Local Authority Housing Team. This work will continue to be developed.\n• Development of working group considering local approach to accommodating people with No Recourse to Public Funds\n• Current review and refresh of Severe Weather Emergency Procedure (SWEP) Protocol via task and finish group.\n• Successful soft launch of Operation Luscombe in June 2020 to address begging and related antisocial behaviour, including by those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation. This is a support-led model although can result in enforcement as a last resort.\n• Imminent pilot launch of Contactless Giving scheme. This will allow members of the public who wish to donate in order to help those who are homeless, including those rough sleeping, by swiping their credit or debit card at several locations in the town centre of Bournemouth. This scheme will expand to the rest of the BCP area in due course. Funds go to Dorset Community Fund, who distribute to those in need, and all proceeds go to those affected by homelessness; all overhead have been covered by the Homelessness Partnership.\n• Lived experience group established collating feedback about their experience of local services\n• Rough Sleepers Initiative Grant fund award £1.4m\n• Next Steps Accommodation Programme grant fund award\n• A Housing First Service Level Agreement in place and property portfolio increased\n• Additional provision commissioned doubling the weekly capacity of the Health Bus which caters for those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation.\n• Two Drug and Alcohol workers assigned to working with those in the Rough Sleeping Pathway, offering tailored interventions and support.\n• Imminent launch of new multi-agency group, Complex Homelessness & Risk Integrated Solutions Panel (CHRISP) to focus on complex cases and building on 3 legacy groups\n• BCP-wide single point of contact for financial help organised through Financial Resilience action group\n• Additional food support for those w/o access to food in Temporary Accommodation organised via faith/voluntary community\n• Community support action group aligning both move-on support and training opportunities",

I am stood in the middle of a nearly empty high street, shivering, and thinking to myself ‘how did I get myself into this one then?’\nI had decided to take on the challenge of trying to sell The Big Issue. I wanted to get a perspective of what it was like to do so; I wanted to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes as it were. Feeling confident I purchased 10 copies for £12.50 and as it was my first time I received 5 extra for free. My confidence was heavily misplaced; I only managed to sell 2. Most people walked by without noticing me, when I offered the magazine I was ignored, and one woman questioned why I was doing it. ‘You don’t look homeless, why are you selling these?’ I tried to explain that I was a master’s student, and a Bournemouth Borough Councilor, and reassured her any money I made would be going to the mental health charity Dorset Mind. She looked at me as though I was from another universe, far removed from hers, before walking off. I probably should have told her it wasn’t necessary to be homeless to sell The Big Issue, you just have to be in need of a helping hand.\nAfter that I was so grateful when people acknowledged me, and the few that gave me money nearly brought me to tears. There is a stigma about homelessness, rough sleeping, and vulnerability. I experienced it first hand. Rough Sleeping in the UK and, most relevantly, Bournemouth is becoming far too big a problem to ignore.\nThe whole of Europe is facing a rise of homelessness and rough sleeping, with the exception of Finland . Finland flipped the script on homelessness. Instead of trying to deal with the social and health problems, they got those who are homeless straight into a house. Since 2008 Finland have had a strategy in place to deal with those on the streets. ‘Investments have been made to provide affordable housing and shelters have been converted into supported housing units. New services and methods of help have been developed to match the multiple needs of individual tenants.’\nThe aim has been to look at long-term solutions rather than quick fixes. Of course when you put someone in a home their problems don’t just disappear, but you give them a solid foundation on which to build. Becoming homeless can happen to just about anyone, in this economy, a sudden job loss or bereavement, you could find yourself on the streets. In Finland they have come to realize that the problems you face are much easier solved when you have a home. Being in a home allows those who need it constant support; appointments with doctors and social workers are harder missed when you have a fixed abode.\nThe Y-Foundation whose goal is to end homelessness in Finland, intend to do so providing affordable rental housing. In 2016 the foundation had 6,675 apartments operating in 52 towns and cities across Finland . The chief executive of the Y-Foundation, Juha Kaakinen, believes that money is not the reason other countries are not following Finland’s initiative. ‘To say that the scarcity of funding in any western European country is the reason for lack of affordable social housing is either an understatement or a conscious misunderstanding. It is simply a question of political will.’\nIn this country there just doesn’t seem to be that same political will that Juha talked about. But there should be. And here’s why; it is more cost effective to put some in a home straight away, rather then leave them on the streets. If we can’t appeal to the humanistic side of Theresa May, then let us appeal to the economical side. It saves money in the long run. In Finland ‘the savings in terms of the services needed by one person can be up to 9,600 euros a year when compared to the costs that would result from that person being homeless.’\nI can already hear the sceptics saying; ‘but we don’t live in Finland, and it couldn’t work here in the UK.’\nWell actually it could, in 2017 the charity Crisis underwent a pilot scheme in the city region of Liverpool to see if it could, and the results were promising. They found that ‘a policy of this kind could be five times more effective and nearly five times more cost effective than existing services.’ The cost of homeless in the UK is more than 1 billion per year according to the government’s spending watchdog . That figure is only going to rise if we don’t address the problem, and in Housing First we seem to have a solution that can go a long way to doing so.\nThis doesn’t mean a home fixes everything. Not at all, the study by Crisis found that along with a house, ‘support to help people exit homelessness should include: emotional support, peer support, independence, not being judged, opportunities for rehabilitation and longer term planning, structure and purpose’.\nMost of these can be covered by the work The Big Issue provides; they have a great team here in Bournemouth. There is a network of support that they provide, they give their vendors structure and purpose, and this enables independence. The only one it struggles to help is ‘not being judged’. That is up to us, we have a responsibility to help the homeless in this simplest way possible, not judging them. We don’t know everyone’s story, and we don’t need to.\nReferences\nhttps://insp.ngo/alarming-trend-shows-homelessness-crisis-across-europe/\nhttps://www.world-habitat.org/world-habitat-awards/winners-and-finalists/y-foundation/\nhttps://ysaatio.fi/en/housing-first-finland\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/how-finland-solved-homelessness/\nClick to access housing_first_feasibility_study_for_the_liverpool_city_region_2017_es.pdf",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_16/content_53.html": "‘Hi Ian See you have seen this one, need to play this close to us, not our job to help the green independents, received a few emails’\nIt’s been just over five months since I was elected to be Throop and Muscliff’s Councillor to proceed the energetic and hardworking Councillor, now Alderman, Anne Rey. Big shoes to fill. It has been quite a five months too, with very little time to take a breath. When I was first elected one commenter said that ‘he’ll be a lamb to the wolves’, in my time so far I would describe myself more as a cat amongst the pigeons.\nI haven’t been afraid to speak or do what I thought was right, in my first full council meeting I was the only councillor who voted against the rise in Council Tax to the maximum allowed; 5.99%. I fought for my seat on the Standards Committee to ensure opposition, formed a political group with Green Party candidate Simon Bull to make sure the Conservatives can’t go behind our backs. I redrew the proposed boundaries for Queens Park and Strouden Park to protect both areas identity and in October I will become the youngest Group Leader in the history of Bournemouth Council. Most recently I called out the Mayor for ‘playing’ politics. It is quite literally the word he used when he sent an email by mistake to a resident. Politics is not a game. It is people’s lives and that can often be lost when we are sat round tables at the Pavilion sipping a class of prosecco making a toast to the new Mayor.\nEveryone is prone to mistakes, in the first full meeting when I voted against Council Tax, I also voted against the budget, believing that since a lot of the budget is made up of Council Tax, it didn’t make sense to vote for one and not the other. Councillor Lawerence Williams, the then Mayor, told me after the meeting that he could have stopped the meeting and asked me for an ‘alternative budget’. He was kind not to, they take around six months to produce, it would have been embarrassing. But what the new Mayor Derek Borthwick did was cynical and machiavellian, not technical, like my mistake, but intentional. He wanted to ‘play this close’ keep others out, namely ‘Green Independents’, and I called him on it in the Echo. Being the Mayor is a non-political role, unbiased, a ceremonial position to be the first citizen of Bournemouth, but even regardless of that fact, it is bad practice to keep ‘things close’ in what we consider as an open democracy.\nThe Mayor offered, in the Echo, to give me an apology, and I haven’t taken him up on it. Not because I am petty, but because I really don’t feel it is me he should be apologising to, it should be the residents that help pay for his chauffeur.\nSince the article we met on two occasions, both very amicable, I felt what’s done is done. The second occasion was at the TMSTH Area Forum, a productive meeting with residents, they normally are. During the meeting a number of people put forward an issue regarding the Number 4 Yellow Bus that had stopped going to Bournemouth Hospital, instead terminating at Castlepoint. Not only is it important for many older residents to get to the hospital, but it is also a main bus stop to go to places such as Salisbury for a day out. I took the microphone and suggested that myself, Mayor Borthwick and fellow ward Councillor Ian Clark should arrange a meeting with the Yellow Buses and the effected residents, to try to convince them to extend that service a few stops. It is not a huge ask, and would make the world of difference to a number of residents. Both seemed keen when put on the spot, I said I would email them later that night, which is what I did.\nThe reply I received the next morning astounded me.\nDear Councillor Wilson\nAfter our meeting last evening I was made aware by Derek Borthwick of your recent article in the Bournemouth Echo concerning the Mayor. I find it completely outrageous that you should disrespect the Mayor of Bournemouth in this way especially in his first weeks of office.\nI will not be prepared to work with you on any local matters until you make a public apology to The Mayor of Bournemouth.\nRegards Ian\nAt first I laughed, then I checked the date, no it wasn’t the first of April, he was serious. I sat there staring at it for five minutes, gobsmacked, but then I felt my blood starting to boil. He is willing to put politics before his residents and their very simple cause, at least the Mayor was trying to hide his intentions.\nHim wanting me to apologise for exposing wrong doing I just found hilarious.\nHim not wanting to work with me for the benefit of residents I found ridiculous.\nAt the top of the piece I mentioned some of the things I’ve done as a councillor, that stuff accounts for around 10% of what I have actually done. That’s the more glamorous side of it. The other 90% is the real work. It is answering your emails, putting forward questions to council on your behalf. It is going round your house for a cup of tea and a chat, not always having the solutions to your problems, but always being an ear to bend. It is fixing streetlights, and fighting excessive rent rises. It is objecting to planning applications and attending meetings. It is smiling when someone says to you ‘it’s nice to see someone younger getting involved’ and it is trying to live up to Ron and Anne. It is working for you a resident of Bournemouth, and more specifically Throop and Muscliff. And I have felt privileged every second since I was elected to represent you.\nSo when some uses you, the resident, as a political hostage, to try to make me apologise, well ‘I find it completely outrageous’.",

Last Friday I was hosting the Conservative Minister for Rough Sleeping and Homelessness, who came down to see the exemplary work we have been doing for those vulnerable on our street. This Friday I am looking at losing my role, as last night the Conservatives put in another Vote of No Confidence. I always felt it was only a matter of time after the passing of my colleague and friend Pete Parish.\nSome part of me, is wondering if it is worth fighting, without the opportunity for by elections the numbers are not in our favour it seems, and I am a bit knackered if truth be told. It is hard at the top, and the conservatives are nothing if not relentless, biting at our heals. But having watched the Overview and Scrutiny meeting last week, and having experienced first hand the discourse and attitude some opposition members have towards those who are homeless in our community, I know that even if there is only a slim chance, we have to fight.\nBelieving that fining those who have do not have proper place to stay is a good idea, instantly drains my confidence in them. I had a lot of friends message to say this can’t be happening. And even in the face of the national outrage that was caused, a number of MP’s across the country even tweeted about it with a link to a Guardian article, they stuck by that line. During my time as the Housing Portfolio Holder there has been fantastic partnership working, which has led to great results, for the year 19/20, we saw a 37% rise in positive outcomes for those who were homeless. And the 20/21 figure will be much higher after our work during Covid. Ministers, especially ones from opposition parties, don’t come and visit often, so when they do you know you are doing something right.\nThat is not to say there isn’t a lot more work to be done, I feel responsible when I see or hear about anyone who doesn’t have a roof over their head in this conurbation. Yet, nationally the legislation needs to change, as do attitudes, something I mentioned to the Minster. He was extremely positive about the work, myself, my team and partner agencies had done during the pandemic, and indicated there is a good chance our Next Steps Accommodation Programme Bid, which totals over £5 million will be accepted due to our success so far. This will make such a difference to so many lives. Those on our streets have to be treated with compassion, not punished with draconian measures as the Tories recommended. And whilst the minister nationally seems to understand that, locally it is a different story.\nWhether or not I am the Portfolio Holder for Housing at the end of this month, the work we as a BCP Homelessness partnership has to continue. It is too important not to, but I fear it will be lost with a change of administration. Prevention is just as important in addressing the issue. There is no appetite for Social Housing in the opposition, I brought forward the first homes at social rent in over 20 years in Bournemouth, and this is a key driver in preventing homelessness, and improving quality of life for so many of our families.\nIf we lose this vote of no confidence it is not me I am worried about, a break will do me the world of good, I’ve given everything I have to this role for the last year and a half. I am worried about those still on our streets, who won’t be helped but hindered, not housed but fined.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_10/content_47.html": "A year and a half ago when I won my by-election I was in earshot of a conservative Councillor stating ‘He’ll be a lamb to the slaughter’ I’ve never forgotten it and I never will. Since then I’ve held the Tories to account, won another election gaining the most votes in Bournemouth, and last night I became the portfolio holder for Housing and Deputy Leader of an administration that kicked the tories out of power. If this is how lambs get slaughtered I no longer need to be a vegetarian.\nWhat was achieved over the last few weeks was no small feat. People will probably never understand just how hard it was. Bringing together five different groups, from all backgrounds, ages and politics, to work together was never going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is right? The 7:00 am meetings, the sleeplessness nights, and seemingly endless talks, at times were a struggle. But this Unity Alliance has so much more uniting us than dividing us. We are all centred around the common goal of leaving the conurbation in a much better state than we left it, we care about the environment, we want transparency, openness and inclusiveness. Not just amongst councillors, but with you as residents. We work for you, people before politics, partnership over partisanship. Be under no illusions though the next four years are going to be tough. The tories will jump on any mistake, and exaggerate it no end. They’ll scrutinise, as they should, and it will be our job to make sure we are up to that scrutiny.\nThis is an opportunity of a lifetime, one that I never thought would come along. Exactly two years ago I was running in the General Election, my main pledge was to try and find a solution to ending homelessness and rough sleeping within Bournemouth. I didn’t feel there was a political will to do so. Now I’m in a position to do that. I can’t quite believe it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have all the answers, but there is certainly no one in this town who is more committed to find those answers than me.\nIt would be so wrong of me to sit here and pretend that this is my victory, it’s not, it’s yours. I am nothing without your support and of course your votes. And I haven’t had a chance to thank everyone who voted for myself and Lisa. We worked so hard during the campaign and you guys recognised that. You voted for change and you’ve got it. You’re no longer shouting into the wind, instead you are in power alongside us. And it’s genuinely exciting. The next four years aren’t going to be a stroll in the park, but we are setting out with the very best of intentions and that’s more than can be said about previous administrations.\nI want wrap up this post by thanking Vikki (she’s going to be a fantastic leader), Mark, Margret, Fizz, George, Stephen and all of those that went into talks a week ago with an open mind, willing to listen and compromise when needed. I want to thank Simon, Chris and Lisa for putting their faith in me as the Group Leader of the Bournemouth Group, to fight for the interests of their residents and of Bournemouth itself. We can’t say for certain what the next four years will bring, but I can say that I’ve never been more excited for the future of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_2/content_8.html": "Today marks my fourth year as a councillor, which is the typical length of a term for someone in my position. It’s as long as Donald Trump got in the White House and a year longer than Theresa May got as Prime Minister. And so to mark the occasion I wanted to reflect, and write a long overdue piece for my blog.\nI won my first election by 22 votes, or as I like to think of it, a football match. Wearing an horrendous donkey jacket and a green knitted fleece which couldn’t have looked worse if I tried (evidence supplied below), I became the youngest member of the council. And straight away I had to learn, thrown into the deep end. A lamb to the slaughter one said on the night of my win. Within a few weeks I’d picked a fight with the Mayor and had started to understand just what local politics could be.\nMy first year and half was tough, it was trying to help residents whilst not being listened to in an opposition of 3 to 51 conservatives. I managed to achieve a few things, youngest group leader in the history of Bournemouth Council, standing against the Wessex field development, and funding seated garden area at Muscliff School which the kids, I’m reliably informed, love.\nI had my little scooter, Betsy, and if you had a problem, I’d be there in a flash, drinking your freshly made tea, tucking into a piece of battenburg, moaning with you about how things needed to change. Little did I know how much they would.\nBefore the full elections in May 2019, I really wasn’t sure I wanted to stand again, the first 18 months were tough, I’d enjoyed it in spells but it was depressing in opposition. But I felt a duty to my residents, and I’d managed to convince Lisa to stand with me. And it was the best decision I could have made, we smashed it, winning by a huge majority, I got the most votes in Bournemouth. And it was worth it just to see the smile on my mum’s face. From a 22 vote margin to a 1,022 vote margin was quite something.\nAnd for the next year and half it lead to me being able to do something I had set out to do when I first stood to be an MP. I became the Cabinet Member for Housing, and could have a direct influence on ending homelessness.\nOver my time on the cabinet I managed, with the support of my group and the Unity Alliance, to achieve so much.\nA huge reduction in rough sleeping with Housing First and a ‘health first’ approach that brought national recognition from MHCLG and a ministerial visit from the MP Luke Hall. The first social rented housing brought through in Bournemouth in over 20 years. Improved sustainability in our new builds to passive house standards which led to a letter from Dame Jane Goodall. The purchase of one of Europe’s largest brownfield sites, Holes Bay, to bring forward new affordable accommodation. And so much more, which I’m sure I’ve mentioned so many times you remember! But all of this lead to me being shortlisted for the country’s Young Councillor of the year.\nAnd then, under difficult circumstances, after the passing of two of our colleagues and more importantly our friends, and without the ability to have new elections during the pandemic we lost control of the council, and I lost my dream job.\nThe year since has been a struggle again, it’s so hard in opposition, you don’t have the same access to officers and information, or influence over decisions. I had to get a second job which as taken time and attention from my council work, thankfully they are a very understanding company. I’ve still been helping residents, answering emails, trying to solve issues. There was one case over the summer where housing officers misinterpreted the law, and my spotting their mistake allowed a number of vulnerable people to stay in their homes. The email of thanks from one resident made me well up. But it’s been hard.\nHowever, the thing I’m proudest of is the structures and cultures I put in place when in charge of Housing are still there. When I first arrived, there was no co-ordination in between the council and outside organisations, however when I left there was a homelessness reduction board and forum, with over 150 different stakeholders all pulling in the same direction to end homelessness. And there’s a specific group which helps those who have no access to public funding which has been so important. Everyone in should mean everyone.\nThere are small wins to be had as well, just yesterday at Health and Adult Social Care overview and scrutiny committee, I seconded a recommendation to ask cabinet members to write to our MPs asking for a review of the carer’s allowance which went up by just 35p a week in 2020, which passed.\nMy four years I’ve met some really interesting people, from the Governor of the Bank of England to those with lived experience of homelessness, each one I’ve learnt so much from, and I have made friends for life.\nSo far my time has been a rollercoaster, ups and downs, not just in the job, but personally after losing my mum, things haven’t been smooth, but it’s been such a privilege. To serve you, to work hard for you, to get things done for you and most importantly to make mistakes and to be forgiven by you.\nThankfully I don’t have to run for election for another year and a half but when they roll around in May 2023 I hope there are loads of good candidates standing, we need great people like you, yes you, running and winning, making the change this area needs. If I can do it, anyone can.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_12/content_61.html": "In the time I’ve been a councillor the biggest issue that has faced me is what should be done with Hicks Farm. There is a general consensus that something needs to be done. The condition that the council have allowed it deteriorate to over the years is unacceptable, and the number of emails I received in my first few months about its condition reinforced that fact. So when the council brought forward their idea about turning it into a community space I approached it, as I approach everything, with an open mind, understanding that Hicks Farm can’t stay in the state it is in.\nHowever the process that it has undertaken in the last 8 months or so hasn’t been the process that should take place when discussing a community space. Firstly the public consultation only spent three days in Throop itself, whilst the rest of the month it was at the Kingfisher Barn. Which whist I acknowledge there is logistical difficulty in having more time in Throop, you can’t spend so little time in the place where the project will be located. Whilst during the consultation period, the opinions and concerns of residents were belittled and mocked by fellow ward councillors as ‘NIMBYs’ which I found distasteful and not what you should expect from those who are said to represent you. The concerns are valid ones, does Throop have the infrastructure for a community space on a scale that will make the project worthwhile for the council? Will it potentially bring a rise in anti-social behaviour? How many cars are going to be parked in an already congested part of the ward? These are just some of the fair questions and concerns that have been raised by my constituents, and it is our jobs as councillors to address these concerns not deride them.\nHowever this pattern of behaviour is not unusual from my fellow ward councillors, Cllr Clark and the Mayor Borthwick, whom not so long ago mistakenly sent an email to a resident in which they were colluding to keep information away from me. Whilst I understand that for them it is just politics being played out, it is you that has suffered. But that doesn’t matter very much to them. Through this whole process I have been kept in the dark. To my astonishment last week at what could be my last area forum, Cllr Clark revealed that Throop Mill had been sold and was under new ownership. This was a fresh information to me, and I have since sent a number of emails to Cllr Clark asking for the details of the acquisition and the new owner. Still waiting on a reply.\nThen yesterday I learnt of an eviction notice being served to tenants of Hicks Farm, not from a phone call from a councillor, or an email from an officer, but from the post of a very active group in my ward, the Throop Village Conservation Group. This group have been important in enhancing your democracy, whilst I have not agreed with very single post they have written, I have appreciated their tenacity and commitment to a cause they feel strongly about. Unfortunately for me they have been far too often where I hear news first. Despite my constant insistence to be updated, and the number of emails I send out on a regular basis asking what the state of play is on number of issues, I am too often kept in the dark on purpose. Which is why you deserve better councillors.\nI include myself in that, I need to improve, I’ve been doing it a year now, I know a lot but I still have so much more to learn. Which is why in two months on May 2nd, if you are going to vote for me, you have to vote for Lisa Northover as well. Her experience will be invaluable to both me and you, her compassion and intelligence will be an asset to the ward and the town. But it is her honesty and integrity that will be the most valuable qualities, both of which are considerably lacking in my colleges. She is of the same opinion as myself with regards to Hicks Farm. That something needs to be done with it, but it has to be done within keeping of the scale and tradition of Throop Village. If an application goes to planning board that we are not happy with we will fight against it with everything we have.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_17/content_56.html": "It’s March, it’s snowing, and the cold has reached parts of my body I forgotten I even had. I am stood in the middle of a nearly empty high street, shivering, and thinking to myself ‘how did I get myself into this one then?’\nI had decided to take on the challenge of trying to sell The Big Issue. I wanted to get a perspective of what it was like to do so; I wanted to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes as it were. Feeling confident I purchased 10 copies for £12.50 and as it was my first time I received 5 extra for free. My confidence was heavily misplaced; I only managed to sell 2. Most people walked by without noticing me, when I offered the magazine I was ignored, and one woman questioned why I was doing it. ‘You don’t look homeless, why are you selling these?’ I tried to explain that I was a master’s student, and a Bournemouth Borough Councilor, and reassured her any money I made would be going to the mental health charity Dorset Mind. She looked at me as though I was from another universe, far removed from hers, before walking off. I probably should have told her it wasn’t necessary to be homeless to sell The Big Issue, you just have to be in need of a helping hand.\nAfter that I was so grateful when people acknowledged me, and the few that gave me money nearly brought me to tears. There is a stigma about homelessness, rough sleeping, and vulnerability. I experienced it first hand. Rough Sleeping in the UK and, most relevantly, Bournemouth is becoming far too big a problem to ignore.\nThe whole of Europe is facing a rise of homelessness and rough sleeping, with the exception of Finland . Finland flipped the script on homelessness. Instead of trying to deal with the social and health problems, they got those who are homeless straight into a house. Since 2008 Finland have had a strategy in place to deal with those on the streets. ‘Investments have been made to provide affordable housing and shelters have been converted into supported housing units. New services and methods of help have been developed to match the multiple needs of individual tenants.’\nThe aim has been to look at long-term solutions rather than quick fixes. Of course when you put someone in a home their problems don’t just disappear, but you give them a solid foundation on which to build. Becoming homeless can happen to just about anyone, in this economy, a sudden job loss or bereavement, you could find yourself on the streets. In Finland they have come to realize that the problems you face are much easier solved when you have a home. Being in a home allows those who need it constant support; appointments with doctors and social workers are harder missed when you have a fixed abode.\nThe Y-Foundation whose goal is to end homelessness in Finland, intend to do so providing affordable rental housing. In 2016 the foundation had 6,675 apartments operating in 52 towns and cities across Finland . The chief executive of the Y-Foundation, Juha Kaakinen, believes that money is not the reason other countries are not following Finland’s initiative. ‘To say that the scarcity of funding in any western European country is the reason for lack of affordable social housing is either an understatement or a conscious misunderstanding. It is simply a question of political will.’\nIn this country there just doesn’t seem to be that same political will that Juha talked about. But there should be. And here’s why; it is more cost effective to put some in a home straight away, rather then leave them on the streets. If we can’t appeal to the humanistic side of Theresa May, then let us appeal to the economical side. It saves money in the long run. In Finland ‘the savings in terms of the services needed by one person can be up to 9,600 euros a year when compared to the costs that would result from that person being homeless.’\nI can already hear the sceptics saying; ‘but we don’t live in Finland, and it couldn’t work here in the UK.’\nWell actually it could, in 2017 the charity Crisis underwent a pilot scheme in the city region of Liverpool to see if it could, and the results were promising. They found that ‘a policy of this kind could be five times more effective and nearly five times more cost effective than existing services.’ The cost of homeless in the UK is more than 1 billion per year according to the government’s spending watchdog . That figure is only going to rise if we don’t address the problem, and in Housing First we seem to have a solution that can go a long way to doing so.\nThis doesn’t mean a home fixes everything. Not at all, the study by Crisis found that along with a house, ‘support to help people exit homelessness should include: emotional support, peer support, independence, not being judged, opportunities for rehabilitation and longer term planning, structure and purpose’.\nMost of these can be covered by the work The Big Issue provides; they have a great team here in Bournemouth. There is a network of support that they provide, they give their vendors structure and purpose, and this enables independence. The only one it struggles to help is ‘not being judged’. That is up to us, we have a responsibility to help the homeless in this simplest way possible, not judging them. We don’t know everyone’s story, and we don’t need to.\nReferences\nhttps://insp.ngo/alarming-trend-shows-homelessness-crisis-across-europe/\nhttps://www.world-habitat.org/world-habitat-awards/winners-and-finalists/y-foundation/\nhttps://ysaatio.fi/en/housing-first-finland\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/how-finland-solved-homelessness/\nClick to access housing_first_feasibility_study_for_the_liverpool_city_region_2017_es.pdf",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_8/content_42.html": "At Full Council last week, a statement was submitted by one member of the public it read:\nIt is clear that BCP has a housing crisis that needs urgent attention. I ask that the Unity Alliance convene an urgent multi-agency task force to establish a Homelessness Action Plan to implement measures to tackle the unfolding situation. With over 700 homeless people dying in the UK in the last year, lives are literally at stake and a crisis response is overdue.\nFor some who previously held a role similar to mine, statements like this would be treated as something that needed to be contested and disputed. Worried about hurting the image of the party or individual. But I welcome this statement, because it is true. We are in a housing crisis; lives are at stake and it does need urgent attention. And even more so I welcome passionate people within the area challenging what we as an Alliance are doing about the current situation. I consider them angels on my shoulder rather than thorns in my side.\nLater today I am presenting a report on the Homelessness and Rough Sleeping Action Plan to the Overview and Scrutiny Board. An interim document before we begin work on a more comprehensive Homelessness Strategy which we have until the 31st March 2021 to complete. However, I would like to see that come forward before 2021 and to be worked alongside the Housing Strategy which should be complete by the end of 2020. During the period as work begins this Action Plan will hopefully ‘implement measures to tackle the unfolding situation’ building on much of the good work we are already doing.\nThe Action plan is summarised through 6 key objectives:\n1) Preventing homelessness and minimising the use of temporary accommodation\n2) Reducing homelessness and rough sleeping to as close to zero as possible (and that should always be our goal, ending it)\n3) Developing a range of suitable housing options and pathways\n4) Improving partnership work and wider communications to ensure an effective use of resources\n5) Improve health, wellbeing and awareness\n6) Update policies, process and protocols after becoming BCP council.\nUnder each of these objectives there is a number of priorities we are pursuing in order to achieve them and I could go through them all in this blog piece, but I’d be concerned about losing your attention.\nSo I want to focus on an objective that I feel the council have failed to live up to its potential in for a number of years now. Which is objective number 4, improving partnership work and wider communications to ensure an effective use of resource. There is so much drive from so many agencies within the conurbation to reduce and end homelessness in its entirety, however for as long as I can remember they haven’t quite been on the same wavelength on how to do it. That is why at the start of my tenure I felt it was vital to get everyone in the same room, fortunately for me, my officers had the same idea, and on October 10th, World Homelessness Day, we launched a new BCP Homelessness Partnership. The partnership will hopefully act as the ‘multi-agency task force’ that the resident requested in their statement to full council. The idea behind it is bringing together local voluntary and statutory organisations, as well as the business community, to join up efforts and tie together projects. So that we can avoid duplication and ensure that there is a common targeted approach to addressing homelessness. The will is certainly there but we all need to be on the same page going forward. This new partnership will include a governance board and a number of focused sub-groups, which will narrow their attention on specific elements, one example being a Meaningful Occupation group, all based around getting those coming off the street, or homeless, back into work, and we have had a lot a positive interest around this. The partnership will co-produce the Homelessness strategy, and at the centre of the partnership will be the Homelessness Reduction Board. The board will agree the strategic direction and vision to prevent homelessness and tackle rough sleeping, which is vital, particularly where these issues require an integrated response between organisations, and it is about creating a framework which we are accountable to if we are not doing as well as we should be.\nJust last week I gave officers a presentation on Housing First and what I had learned in Finland. At the heart of why Finland have been so successful is the ability to work in partnership for the common good. There are so many organisations working well together, communicating, and the lead comes from the local and national government. And I really hope that the next government in this country understands the scale of the task they have ahead of them, whoever it is come the 12th December. Because the previous governments haven’t, when the financial crisis hit in 2008, cuts were made in Finland, but housing was invested in and that for me is the reason they are currently ranked as the happiest country in the world. Because without sounding like a broken record; if you have a decent home everything else starts to fall into place. Being holistic in our approach is also vital, every aspect for a person’s life can potentially make them homeless, from a job loss, to a broken-down relationship, or a rogue landlord. That is why I am doing a number of things outside of this Action Plan such as bringing forward Discretionary Licencing to go to public consultation (which will be a blog of its own in a couple of months) and am looking forward to working with a cross section of organisations in health and children’s services on the housing and homelessness strategies.\nAt the launch back of the partnership in October there was a tension, and I think that is quite natural, in fact I would be surprised if there wasn’t. For a few that was caused by a feeling of ‘we’ve been here before with the council’, for others it was caused by the contrasting interests of other groups. But regardless of those tensions, everyone that was in the room brought a great dynamism to the debate, all representing organisations that have improved people’s lives already, and within the room were all the answers we need to end homelessness. But ending homelessness will not happen overnight, it almost definitely will not happen in my time as portfolio holder, but what I do what we do in the next four years can lay down solid foundations on which future administrations can build upon.\nSo I want to thank the kind person for the statement, it is not only welcomed but appreciated, keep them coming in, only when you stop will I know my our work is done.",

I remember that day with such clarity, the weather was fairly grim, it was cold, because of which I certainly hadn’t anticipated so many of you going to the polls to vote for me. I spent the first part of the morning delivering my last few letters with my Dad, then in the afternoon, I went back home to play FIFA 18 to calm both my excitement and my nerves for the evening ahead. When I arrived at the Town Hall for the results I was greeted by a council officer who thought I was a counting agent not a candidate. But after the counting began it was clear that I was not only a candidate but a contender. It is an incredibly surreal feeling seeing ballot paper after ballot paper with a cross by your name. When it had become clear that I had won, by a margin of 22 votes, or a football match as I like to think of it, the pride I felt was inexplicable.\nA year on I still have that extreme sense of pride, and I still haven’t got used to people calling me Councillor, I probably never will. But one thing have started to get used to in this past year is the way that local government operates, and I have begun to understand its flaws, of which there are many. Firstly there is procedures and archaic ceremonies which put you instantly on the back foot as young candidate, whether designed to intimidate or not they certainly have that effect, there are so many points of order that you spend as much time worrying about getting those right then you do the matter at hand. But these are nothing compared to the way the council actually conducts business with in the chamber at Full Council meetings, Cabinet decisions are passed with no effort at all. Councillors will often describe consensus on motions such as ‘We should be reducing plastic usage in the council’ as a debate. It is not a debate Councillor if everyone agrees it is a good idea and that it should have been implemented years ago.\nThen there are the staged questions that councillors, who are obviously conservative because there aren’t really any others, par take in. The ‘Can someone one tell me what we are doing about this very minor issue?’ questions. To which a portfolio holder replies ‘Oh it’s funny you should ask that question we just did something to look good about it yesterday and I have this answer that will not only allow me to show off, get in the echo, but also allow me a few digs at Labour, Lib Dems or any other party who dare question us’. I so often get disillusioned with the Full Council meetings. Pre-arranged questions with pre-arranged answers, never written by the councillors themselves but the hard working officers.\nThere is no debate, no dialogue, no authenticity in the council, and especially among the councillors themselves. Don’t get me wrong, there are a number of hardworking, honest councillors who despite their ideological persuasions I would be happy to see elected again, however there isn’t nearly as many as there should be. However in May we have the chance to change things, not only the council’s composition in terms of which party they represent, but with the merging of Christchurch, Poole and Bournemouth Councils we have the chance to change the way it operates. That is such an exciting prospect. But things won’t change if we keep voting conservative as a town. Einstein, whom I am led to believe was quite intelligent, said ‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.’ There needs to be more accountability in our local government, whilst conservatives have had it too easy for too long. What they want happens, and who is it benefiting, rough sleeping and homelessness have increased so much over the last ten years in Bournemouth whilst they have been in Government locally. They argue they are doing the best they can with their hands financially tied from national government, yet they wear the name and emblem of those keeping them captive, it’s Stockholm syndrome at its worse.\nHomelessness is the very visible failure of the conservative government both nationally and locally, but on top of that you have the paradoxical stance of wanting to protect greenbelt land at all costs with willing building on greenbelt land if there’s no cost. At the end of this month it’s almost certain that the A338 Wessex Fields scheme will be granted permission, despite its obvious flaws, because there is a huge grant coming from central government that can only be spent on that.\nI want to end this on a brighter note by saying thank you to those who voted for me a year ago today. It was a special night, and one that reflecting on will always bring a smile to my face. In the subsequent year I have given it my all to represent you, I know there’s more I could have done, and I know there is much more still to do. As we head towards May 2nd I would obviously love you to vote for me again, and for Lisa for the first time, but I really urge everyone in Bournemouth to think about who they are voting for. It’s time to end the insanity.",

Since my last a lot of bad things have happened, by far the worst of which was my mum, whom many of you reading this will know, passed away. She was my best friend, my angel. She wasn’t really into politics, except when I was running. She didn’t care particularly for the left or right, she only knew to be kind. That is what I’ve always tried to do, though my success rate has never been as high as her’s.\nThe last two months have been a battle, I haven’t taken any leave because I was really not sure I would be able to start again if I stopped. And actually continuing to work has really helped. The support of fellow councillors has been so good, and I am enterally grateful to the members of my group, the cabinet, officers and the whole of the Unity Alliance, along with a number of conservatives who have been really good to me. At her funeral the music we said goodbye to her with was the song her and my dad had their first dance to after they were married ‘Always Look on the Bright Side of Life’, Monty Python’s classic, and that is because she always did. Even when life was jolly rotten, she continued smiling through, and that is what I have to do.\nLast week I sat in front of the Overview and Scrutiny committee presenting my first Housing Revenue Account Budget, it was exactly a month after my Mum’s funeral and getting up to the table to speak was a huge achievement for me. What I presented was a forward thinking paper which set out plans on how we will use HRA funding to deliver more and improved housing, that meets local needs, addresses affordability issues driving the housing crisis, supports measures around tackling homelessness and drives work around the sustainability of the stock ensuring it is fit for purpose for not just now but 50 years time. And whilst getting those words out, felt like climbing Everest barefoot, when I did it felt so good.\nAt the minute I am up and down, and when I am down I am really down, but I think it is very natural. To lose your best friend, the one person who loves you unconditionally is so hard, and it is really just starting to sink in. But I know that mum would want me to be positive, and that she would want me to carry on, working hard, and trying to help improve people’s lives in whatever way possible. Whether that was through building more social rented housing or just having time to chat them to talk through their problems.\nTomorrow would have been her 63rd Birthday, instead of being in the house with her watching channel 5 movies and eating rubbish, I will be at the Homelessness Reduction Board, continuing the collaborative work we have started to bring an end to homelessness, it is what she would have loved me to be doing.\nI want to thank everyone who has supported me throughout. It is really hard of course and it will be for a while, but I’ll get there. As they say when you’re chewing on life’s gristle, Don’t grumble, give a whistle! And this’ll help things turn out for the best.\nDu, Du, Du du du!\nLove you mum x",

But to do it in the midst of a global pandemic, a pandemic in which their national government’s response has been so poor, after the death of one of our councillors, is quite something. We are living in unprecedented times, so I guess it is quite reassuring to see somethings still don’t change. But this power play has come at the worst time, when we all need to focus on getting through the rest of this crisis, and managing a delicate recovery. It’s an unnecessary and crass distraction.\nIn the ridiculous press release announcing their attempt to gain power they planted a few slogans and phrases that I’m sure we will be seeing more of over the next week as this plays out. One of really witty phrases was one calling the cabinet, a ‘cabinet of compromise’ *sighs*. Which I bet they thought was genius. As if compromising is the worst possible quality decision makers could possess. I think compromise is only truly unacceptable to a tyrant or a dictator. Go figure. I’ve already seen a number of opposition councillors regurgitate it on the twitter feeds.\nWell I would like to take you behind the scenes of that cabinet, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to rename it, ‘the cabinet of cool’. The re-brand is equally as awful and cringe as their’s, I admit, but there are very few adjectives beginning with ‘C’ that so perfectly describe the cabinet. As pulled from Wikipedia the definition Coolness is an ascetic of attitude, behavior, appearance and style which is generally admired. It has associations with self control and composure. Which are exactly the qualities you need when making difficult decisions under pressure. So I want to take you through each cabinet member and explain to you what makes them so damn cool.\nI’m going to start with Dr. Felicity Rice, or as she will insist you call her, Fizz. There is nothing cooler in this life than being 100% true to who you are, and she does this. She is the cabinet’s conscience, she pushes us to really consider the effects of all of our decisions, she makes sure we weigh up the consequences in the short and long term, the impact on the environment and climate change, her portfolio, and how we can do things better in all aspects. Which are the qualities we need in creating a better place to live after the crisis.\nNext up is the funniest cabinet member, Lesley Dedman, she’s absolutely and utterly brilliant, her humour is razor sharp and she can cut an opponent in a debate with one line. She is never fazed by anything which so important, especially as she has been in charge of the most important portfolio during this pandemic, Adult Health and social care and done a phenomenal job. Cool? She drives a Jag and dresses as though she edits vogue. Enough said.\nDavid Brown, or as I like to call him, Casanova, he’s very romantic and we can be often found chatting about our love lives or lack of them. He is calculated, he weighs up risk, balancing it with reward, the perfect person to be in charge of the finance portfolio. His coolness is questionable due to the large collection of Star Trek memorabilia he sells. But it’s very cool he has a heart of gold, because if this government doesn’t support local councils adequately, we can cut it out and sell it.\nAndy Hadley, is one of the cleverest people I know. His knowledge of his Transport portfolio is second to none. Bournemouth has the worst congestion of any town in this country, thanks to the previous administration. Andy is the man to change that. He’s very cool, got a Back to the Future Doc Brown vibe, but the intelligence to back it up, could make socks and sandals look good.\nNot giving up is the hallmark of a champion, and Lewis Alison could have easily thrown in the towel after his first six months in the role. The most inexperienced of us, faced what could probably be described as bullying by some Tories, but dug in, stuck at it, and now made the real strides in his Tourism and Leisure portfolio. Big ideas for the future of tourism in a post-covid world. He’s made of the right stuff, and when going the got tough he got going. Ice cool.\nMargret Phipps, in charge of strategic planning, cares about the green belt and preserving it. She always says what she believes, which is exactly what you want from someone representing you. She has a vast amount of experience to call upon, which is handy for those without. She also has horses which is very cool, and I hope she reads this because I’d really like to meet them when the virus is gone.\nSandra Moore, looks after the children’s portfolio, and she is an encyclopaedia of local knowledge. She knows so many stories of the three towns past, and knowing your history is so important in shaping the future. Can enjoy a good moan, but always ends up laughing at the end of it. Very cool, younger than her years, only problem is she prefers Cats to Dogs. Nero wasn’t impressed.\nMark Howell lives and breaths regeneration his portfolio, has a strong vision to revitalise our town centres but wants to be inclusive. He welcomes challenges and accepts new ideas better than his own. Very excited to work with him on Holes Bay, a Housing project with so much potential. At the last election he strolled in wearing an outfit that would have made Willy Wonka blush, came out re-elected, only he could pull it off. That’s cool.\nThen there is our leader Vikki Slade. My favourite band is the Stone Roses, who coined the name after wanting to get the perfect balance of soft and hard. And that’s what Vikki is, she cares so very deeply about every single one of you, but she’s ready to make difficult decisions and to defend challenges against the Tories. She has so much energy I don’t know where she gets it from. And of course she is cool, I’ve just compared her to the coolest band in the world.\nFinally there’s me. Well somebody has to make the tea, take notes and tell jokes, right?\nYou know what is really cool is that we are a team, a diverse collective, from all walks of life, each with our own style. And we don’t compromise, we challenge each other to come to the best possible conclusion for you. Always looking to improve and learn. We don’t start from the conservative presumption that we are right and that is that. We weight it all up. We consider it. And we take action. It is calm and composed, some might even say cool. It’s the best governance this conurbation has ever seen. Led by the best leader this conurbation has ever seen.\nShe’ll carry on through it all, she’s a waterfall. – Stone Roses",

Big shoes to fill. It has been quite a five months too, with very little time to take a breath. When I was first elected one commenter said that ‘he’ll be a lamb to the wolves’, in my time so far I would describe myself more as a cat amongst the pigeons.\nI haven’t been afraid to speak or do what I thought was right, in my first full council meeting I was the only councillor who voted against the rise in Council Tax to the maximum allowed; 5.99%. I fought for my seat on the Standards Committee to ensure opposition, formed a political group with Green Party candidate Simon Bull to make sure the Conservatives can’t go behind our backs. I redrew the proposed boundaries for Queens Park and Strouden Park to protect both areas identity and in October I will become the youngest Group Leader in the history of Bournemouth Council. Most recently I called out the Mayor for ‘playing’ politics. It is quite literally the word he used when he sent an email by mistake to a resident. Politics is not a game. It is people’s lives and that can often be lost when we are sat round tables at the Pavilion sipping a class of prosecco making a toast to the new Mayor.\nEveryone is prone to mistakes, in the first full meeting when I voted against Council Tax, I also voted against the budget, believing that since a lot of the budget is made up of Council Tax, it didn’t make sense to vote for one and not the other. Councillor Lawerence Williams, the then Mayor, told me after the meeting that he could have stopped the meeting and asked me for an ‘alternative budget’. He was kind not to, they take around six months to produce, it would have been embarrassing. But what the new Mayor Derek Borthwick did was cynical and machiavellian, not technical, like my mistake, but intentional. He wanted to ‘play this close’ keep others out, namely ‘Green Independents’, and I called him on it in the Echo. Being the Mayor is a non-political role, unbiased, a ceremonial position to be the first citizen of Bournemouth, but even regardless of that fact, it is bad practice to keep ‘things close’ in what we consider as an open democracy.\nThe Mayor offered, in the Echo, to give me an apology, and I haven’t taken him up on it. Not because I am petty, but because I really don’t feel it is me he should be apologising to, it should be the residents that help pay for his chauffeur.\nSince the article we met on two occasions, both very amicable, I felt what’s done is done. The second occasion was at the TMSTH Area Forum, a productive meeting with residents, they normally are. During the meeting a number of people put forward an issue regarding the Number 4 Yellow Bus that had stopped going to Bournemouth Hospital, instead terminating at Castlepoint. Not only is it important for many older residents to get to the hospital, but it is also a main bus stop to go to places such as Salisbury for a day out. I took the microphone and suggested that myself, Mayor Borthwick and fellow ward Councillor Ian Clark should arrange a meeting with the Yellow Buses and the effected residents, to try to convince them to extend that service a few stops. It is not a huge ask, and would make the world of difference to a number of residents. Both seemed keen when put on the spot, I said I would email them later that night, which is what I did.\nThe reply I received the next morning astounded me.\nDear Councillor Wilson\nAfter our meeting last evening I was made aware by Derek Borthwick of your recent article in the Bournemouth Echo concerning the Mayor. I find it completely outrageous that you should disrespect the Mayor of Bournemouth in this way especially in his first weeks of office.\nI will not be prepared to work with you on any local matters until you make a public apology to The Mayor of Bournemouth.\nRegards Ian\nAt first I laughed, then I checked the date, no it wasn’t the first of April, he was serious. I sat there staring at it for five minutes, gobsmacked, but then I felt my blood starting to boil. He is willing to put politics before his residents and their very simple cause, at least the Mayor was trying to hide his intentions.\nHim wanting me to apologise for exposing wrong doing I just found hilarious.\nHim not wanting to work with me for the benefit of residents I found ridiculous.\nAt the top of the piece I mentioned some of the things I’ve done as a councillor, that stuff accounts for around 10% of what I have actually done. That’s the more glamorous side of it. The other 90% is the real work. It is answering your emails, putting forward questions to council on your behalf. It is going round your house for a cup of tea and a chat, not always having the solutions to your problems, but always being an ear to bend. It is fixing streetlights, and fighting excessive rent rises. It is objecting to planning applications and attending meetings. It is smiling when someone says to you ‘it’s nice to see someone younger getting involved’ and it is trying to live up to Ron and Anne. It is working for you a resident of Bournemouth, and more specifically Throop and Muscliff. And I have felt privileged every second since I was elected to represent you.\nSo when some uses you, the resident, as a political hostage, to try to make me apologise, well ‘I find it completely outrageous’.",

Last Friday I was hosting the Conservative Minister for Rough Sleeping and Homelessness, who came down to see the exemplary work we have been doing for those vulnerable on our street. This Friday I am looking at losing my role, as last night the Conservatives put in another Vote of No Confidence. I always felt it was only a matter of time after the passing of my colleague and friend Pete Parish.\nSome part of me, is wondering if it is worth fighting, without the opportunity for by elections the numbers are not in our favour it seems, and I am a bit knackered if truth be told. It is hard at the top, and the conservatives are nothing if not relentless, biting at our heals. But having watched the Overview and Scrutiny meeting last week, and having experienced first hand the discourse and attitude some opposition members have towards those who are homeless in our community, I know that even if there is only a slim chance, we have to fight.\nBelieving that fining those who have do not have proper place to stay is a good idea, instantly drains my confidence in them. I had a lot of friends message to say this can’t be happening. And even in the face of the national outrage that was caused, a number of MP’s across the country even tweeted about it with a link to a Guardian article, they stuck by that line. During my time as the Housing Portfolio Holder there has been fantastic partnership working, which has led to great results, for the year 19/20, we saw a 37% rise in positive outcomes for those who were homeless. And the 20/21 figure will be much higher after our work during Covid. Ministers, especially ones from opposition parties, don’t come and visit often, so when they do you know you are doing something right.\nThat is not to say there isn’t a lot more work to be done, I feel responsible when I see or hear about anyone who doesn’t have a roof over their head in this conurbation. Yet, nationally the legislation needs to change, as do attitudes, something I mentioned to the Minster. He was extremely positive about the work, myself, my team and partner agencies had done during the pandemic, and indicated there is a good chance our Next Steps Accommodation Programme Bid, which totals over £5 million will be accepted due to our success so far. This will make such a difference to so many lives. Those on our streets have to be treated with compassion, not punished with draconian measures as the Tories recommended. And whilst the minister nationally seems to understand that, locally it is a different story.\nWhether or not I am the Portfolio Holder for Housing at the end of this month, the work we as a BCP Homelessness partnership has to continue. It is too important not to, but I fear it will be lost with a change of administration. Prevention is just as important in addressing the issue. There is no appetite for Social Housing in the opposition, I brought forward the first homes at social rent in over 20 years in Bournemouth, and this is a key driver in preventing homelessness, and improving quality of life for so many of our families.\nIf we lose this vote of no confidence it is not me I am worried about, a break will do me the world of good, I’ve given everything I have to this role for the last year and a half. I am worried about those still on our streets, who won’t be helped but hindered, not housed but fined.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2018_12_14_whats-better-than-one-independent-councillor-two-of-course/content_51.html": "The curse of winning a by-election so close to the full elections is that as you’ve just started to find your feet you already have to start thinking about your next election. May 2019 might seem like a long way off, but when you have to plan an election and the number of electors that can vote for you has doubled, six months will go pretty quickly. So, I already have one eye on the next election. In my formative years I was part of the 34th Bournemouth Scout Group, where we were taught to ‘always be prepared’. By thinking about my election this far in advance, that is what I am trying to do.\nPart of that preparation is looking for candidates to run with me in the ward, the next election will more than likely see the merging of Throop, Muscliff and Strouden Park, doubling the electorate and cutting the number of seats from six to three. I want to see good people take those seats and I also want a reduction in the party politics we experience in local government. Too many times, even in my short time as a councillor, many at the council have put politics ahead of you and your needs, which quite frankly that isn’t acceptable.\nSo I want to talk to you about Lisa who I have asked to run with me next year. Some of you may know her better as Lisa Northover and I am sure many of you will have already voted for her when she stood in the 2010 General Election as a Liberal Democrat candidate acquiring 13,592 votes. Between 2007 and 2011, Lisa was elected as the councillor for Boscombe West. During her period as a councillor, she did so much for her residents. Throughout the years, she has campaigned locally on housing issues resulting in positive action, many of which have improved local peoples living conditions. Lisa has also run several community projects including one to plant 500 fruit trees in our town. She has lived in Bournemouth her whole life, works for a local charity, and was also a Non Executive Director of a local NHS Trust.\nWhilst all of this makes for an impressive CV, this stuff isn’t why I want Lisa to run with me. If she had no previous experience and she hadn’t improved the lives of so many in her ward in the past, it would make no difference to me. That is because Lisa is everything someone representing you should be. She is intelligent, caring and fierce when she needs to be. Lisa is one of the main reasons I became a councillor. My election team was made up of just three people; me, my father, who would deliver leaflets when he could, and Lisa, who designed my leaflets and guided me through the campaign. In fact, she was the one who encouraged me to run in the first place. She was only ever a message away and was always ready with an answer or solution I could use. Which is exactly what you need from a councillor, right?\nJust like Anne Rey, Lisa used to be a Lib Dem and just like Anne Rey, she has become disillusioned with the party politics that have eroded democracy within this town. Over the last ten years, the conservative party has dominated the make up of the council – currently they are 51 of the 54 councillors – yet many feel that things within the town are getting worse. Homelessness, anti-social behaviour, and in my ward there is a serious problem with parking. This summer around Kingfisher Barn, there has been ridiculous amounts of litter and reports of abusing the natural environment. Whilst I have tried to listen and put your problems forward, without the support of councillors who have no agenda around me, my hands have at times been tied. I am approaching my eleventh month in the role and even in this short time, I have learned a lot, but the main thing I have learnt is that there are not enough councillors with the characteristics that Lisa possesses, and it is you who is suffering because of it. So, I am proud to announce that Lisa is running with me in the next election and when we both get elected, we will be a dynamic duo not to be messed with.",

The greenbelt surrounding the conurbation is currently under great threat by this conservative council, and quite frankly it’s vanity.\nThe council won funding from the Conservative national government to cover the costs of the development, £65 million in total, however the only thing they can spend this money on is a flawed project destined to cause more problems in the long term. The proposals are so flawed in fact the planning officer objected to them and then stepped down from the project. Since they have adjusted their proposals, but they are not proposals to be adjusted but scrapped all together. I have been against the scheme since 2017 when I first heard about it, and shared a platform with Bournemouth East’s MP Tobias Elwood objecting against it during the General Election campaign. Since writing the letter to Jane, there has also been another issue regarding conservation within my own ward. That of Hicks Farm in the beautiful village of Throop. To say it has got my residents talking is an understatement, the consultation recently was lively, and gave a lot of people food for thought. Even though I consider myself to have an open mind on what happens at Hicks Farm, the consensus I felt is that any building work had to be in keeping with the scale and personality of Throop. If the council put in a planning application that doesn’t do this, I will be standing alongside my residents fighting to stop it, as is my duty to them.\nMy letter to Jane was my way of venting against what I saw as injustice, at the time I had no influence, I was thinking about running but hadn’t committed to doing so, but I just care so much about preserving the beauty of this town. It is our greatest asset, and Thoop and Holdenhurst are really jewels in Bournemouth’s crown. I never expected to get a reply from her, let alone the one I received a few months later. One sunny May morning just a couple of days before the FA Cup final, a letter came through the post. I didn’t recognise the handwriting and anticipated another concerned residents correspondence about something the council had failed to do. Instead to my amazement, when I opened it I had the sweetest note from my long standing idol, which is now safely secured in my treasure box. She wanted to meet me. I was excited to say the least, Jane tours the world spreading her message of hope, conservation and sustainability in universities and on theatre stages across the globe, from Bangkok to Baltimore, so finding a time to meet was always going to be difficult. She rarely gets a minute to herself. However after numerous emails back and forth with her secretary, Claire, a couple of weeks ago I received one with a date and an address.\nAnd just like that Dame Jane Goodall was pouring me a cup of tea in her living room, whilst her sister Judy cut me a slice of the most moist gluten free cake you’re ever likely to taste. I honestly felt as though I was in a dream, the word surreal doesn’t even cover it. At first I found it hard to speak, my mouth didn’t seem to want to open and when it did it was saying the most trivial things, here I was with an absolute icon and for one of the few times in my life I was speechless.\nEventually though once we started talking about the important issues of the day, particularly in Bournemouth, I couldn’t stop. She asked about the A338, I explained to her the paradoxical nature of the development, aimed to ease congestion, yet will create, according to the portfolio holder himself, Mike Greene, 2,000 new jobs on an accompanying site built for offices and new business. It is obvious to anyone without their head in the sand that 2,000 new jobs will cause an increase in traffic. I told her about the recent success of saving the Cob Barn, a building of over 500 years old. Yet despite this success, the council will just move their plans to cut into more of the greenbelt we are trying to save. I praised the activism within the area that has been a constant thorn in the council’s side, much of which has been coming from residents in my own ward, the council needs to be scrutinised and they are an important part of that role. Jane was disappointed with what she was hearing, but not surprised, but she told me to keep going, ‘keep doing what you are doing’.\nSometimes in this role it can be demoralising, the politics, the daunting size of the majority this conservative council has, but hearing your hero say you have to keep fighting is something that will stick with me, in this role and in whatever role I’m in come next May, and I always will keep standing up for what I believe is right. As Jane put another log on the fire, and I poured myself another cup of tea, it was my turn to listen, as Jane spoke about her work through her foundation ‘Roots and Shoots’ in Tanzania, and across the world. We talked at length about the problems of the world, Trump, the Paris Climate agreement, about the state of politics in Brazil, the importance of travel. And we ended on a positive note as I told her about the kindness I received throughout the world, especially in Rome. Before we knew it, almost two hours went just like that, Jane had to take her leave to make a conference call, another good fight to fight no doubt. As I left Jane’s house, I really left a different person, filled with hope, with fight, and with understanding of what it is to show humility despite being incredible.\nConserving Bournemouth’s beauty and character are high on my agenda, the A338 improvement scheme will not do this. It is, to all intents and purposes, a vanity project that will cause so many more problems in the long term than it will solve in the short term. Bournemouth was recently named the greenest town in the UK for the second year running, and the council are happy to take the credit for this. But when it comes to conserving the treasured greenbelt around the conurbation they are only too quick to sign off the planning application.\nAs I sign off this post, I want to congratulate those who helped to save the Cob Barn, Jane says ‘keep fighting’, I want to shame the council who over the last two decades have allowed it to deteriorate.

  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_5/content_14.html": "The Tories leadership are back to playing politics, nothing unusual there. But to do it in the midst of a global pandemic, a pandemic in which their national government’s response has been so poor, after the death of one of our councillors, is quite something. We are living in unprecedented times, so I guess it is quite reassuring to see somethings still don’t change. But this power play has come at the worst time, when we all need to focus on getting through the rest of this crisis, and managing a delicate recovery. It’s an unnecessary and crass distraction.\nIn the ridiculous press release announcing their attempt to gain power they planted a few slogans and phrases that I’m sure we will be seeing more of over the next week as this plays out. One of really witty phrases was one calling the cabinet, a ‘cabinet of compromise’ *sighs*. Which I bet they thought was genius. As if compromising is the worst possible quality decision makers could possess. I think compromise is only truly unacceptable to a tyrant or a dictator. Go figure. I’ve already seen a number of opposition councillors regurgitate it on the twitter feeds.\nWell I would like to take you behind the scenes of that cabinet, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to rename it, ‘the cabinet of cool’. The re-brand is equally as awful and cringe as their’s, I admit, but there are very few adjectives beginning with ‘C’ that so perfectly describe the cabinet. As pulled from Wikipedia the definition Coolness is an ascetic of attitude, behavior, appearance and style which is generally admired. It has associations with self control and composure. Which are exactly the qualities you need when making difficult decisions under pressure. So I want to take you through each cabinet member and explain to you what makes them so damn cool.\nI’m going to start with Dr. Felicity Rice, or as she will insist you call her, Fizz. There is nothing cooler in this life than being 100% true to who you are, and she does this. She is the cabinet’s conscience, she pushes us to really consider the effects of all of our decisions, she makes sure we weigh up the consequences in the short and long term, the impact on the environment and climate change, her portfolio, and how we can do things better in all aspects. Which are the qualities we need in creating a better place to live after the crisis.\nNext up is the funniest cabinet member, Lesley Dedman, she’s absolutely and utterly brilliant, her humour is razor sharp and she can cut an opponent in a debate with one line. She is never fazed by anything which so important, especially as she has been in charge of the most important portfolio during this pandemic, Adult Health and social care and done a phenomenal job. Cool? She drives a Jag and dresses as though she edits vogue. Enough said.\nDavid Brown, or as I like to call him, Casanova, he’s very romantic and we can be often found chatting about our love lives or lack of them. He is calculated, he weighs up risk, balancing it with reward, the perfect person to be in charge of the finance portfolio. His coolness is questionable due to the large collection of Star Trek memorabilia he sells. But it’s very cool he has a heart of gold, because if this government doesn’t support local councils adequately, we can cut it out and sell it.\nAndy Hadley, is one of the cleverest people I know. His knowledge of his Transport portfolio is second to none. Bournemouth has the worst congestion of any town in this country, thanks to the previous administration. Andy is the man to change that. He’s very cool, got a Back to the Future Doc Brown vibe, but the intelligence to back it up, could make socks and sandals look good.\nNot giving up is the hallmark of a champion, and Lewis Alison could have easily thrown in the towel after his first six months in the role. The most inexperienced of us, faced what could probably be described as bullying by some Tories, but dug in, stuck at it, and now made the real strides in his Tourism and Leisure portfolio. Big ideas for the future of tourism in a post-covid world. He’s made of the right stuff, and when going the got tough he got going. Ice cool.\nMargret Phipps, in charge of strategic planning, cares about the green belt and preserving it. She always says what she believes, which is exactly what you want from someone representing you. She has a vast amount of experience to call upon, which is handy for those without. She also has horses which is very cool, and I hope she reads this because I’d really like to meet them when the virus is gone.\nSandra Moore, looks after the children’s portfolio, and she is an encyclopaedia of local knowledge. She knows so many stories of the three towns past, and knowing your history is so important in shaping the future. Can enjoy a good moan, but always ends up laughing at the end of it. Very cool, younger than her years, only problem is she prefers Cats to Dogs. Nero wasn’t impressed.\nMark Howell lives and breaths regeneration his portfolio, has a strong vision to revitalise our town centres but wants to be inclusive. He welcomes challenges and accepts new ideas better than his own. Very excited to work with him on Holes Bay, a Housing project with so much potential. At the last election he strolled in wearing an outfit that would have made Willy Wonka blush, came out re-elected, only he could pull it off. That’s cool.\nThen there is our leader Vikki Slade. My favourite band is the Stone Roses, who coined the name after wanting to get the perfect balance of soft and hard. And that’s what Vikki is, she cares so very deeply about every single one of you, but she’s ready to make difficult decisions and to defend challenges against the Tories. She has so much energy I don’t know where she gets it from. And of course she is cool, I’ve just compared her to the coolest band in the world.\nFinally there’s me. Well somebody has to make the tea, take notes and tell jokes, right?\nYou know what is really cool is that we are a team, a diverse collective, from all walks of life, each with our own style. And we don’t compromise, we challenge each other to come to the best possible conclusion for you. Always looking to improve and learn. We don’t start from the conservative presumption that we are right and that is that. We weight it all up. We consider it. And we take action. It is calm and composed, some might even say cool. It’s the best governance this conurbation has ever seen. Led by the best leader this conurbation has ever seen.\nShe’ll carry on through it all, she’s a waterfall. – Stone Roses",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2019_03_03_hicks-farm-throop-mill-and-why-you-deserve-better-councillors/content_40.html": "In the time I’ve been a councillor the biggest issue that has faced me is what should be done with Hicks Farm. There is a general consensus that something needs to be done. The condition that the council have allowed it deteriorate to over the years is unacceptable, and the number of emails I received in my first few months about its condition reinforced that fact. So when the council brought forward their idea about turning it into a community space I approached it, as I approach everything, with an open mind, understanding that Hicks Farm can’t stay in the state it is in.\nHowever the process that it has undertaken in the last 8 months or so hasn’t been the process that should take place when discussing a community space. Firstly the public consultation only spent three days in Throop itself, whilst the rest of the month it was at the Kingfisher Barn. Which whist I acknowledge there is logistical difficulty in having more time in Throop, you can’t spend so little time in the place where the project will be located. Whilst during the consultation period, the opinions and concerns of residents were belittled and mocked by fellow ward councillors as ‘NIMBYs’ which I found distasteful and not what you should expect from those who are said to represent you. The concerns are valid ones, does Throop have the infrastructure for a community space on a scale that will make the project worthwhile for the council? Will it potentially bring a rise in anti-social behaviour? How many cars are going to be parked in an already congested part of the ward? These are just some of the fair questions and concerns that have been raised by my constituents, and it is our jobs as councillors to address these concerns not deride them.\nHowever this pattern of behaviour is not unusual from my fellow ward councillors, Cllr Clark and the Mayor Borthwick, whom not so long ago mistakenly sent an email to a resident in which they were colluding to keep information away from me. Whilst I understand that for them it is just politics being played out, it is you that has suffered. But that doesn’t matter very much to them. Through this whole process I have been kept in the dark. To my astonishment last week at what could be my last area forum, Cllr Clark revealed that Throop Mill had been sold and was under new ownership. This was a fresh information to me, and I have since sent a number of emails to Cllr Clark asking for the details of the acquisition and the new owner. Still waiting on a reply.\nThen yesterday I learnt of an eviction notice being served to tenants of Hicks Farm, not from a phone call from a councillor, or an email from an officer, but from the post of a very active group in my ward, the Throop Village Conservation Group. This group have been important in enhancing your democracy, whilst I have not agreed with very single post they have written, I have appreciated their tenacity and commitment to a cause they feel strongly about. Unfortunately for me they have been far too often where I hear news first. Despite my constant insistence to be updated, and the number of emails I send out on a regular basis asking what the state of play is on number of issues, I am too often kept in the dark on purpose. Which is why you deserve better councillors.\nI include myself in that, I need to improve, I’ve been doing it a year now, I know a lot but I still have so much more to learn. Which is why in two months on May 2nd, if you are going to vote for me, you have to vote for Lisa Northover as well. Her experience will be invaluable to both me and you, her compassion and intelligence will be an asset to the ward and the town. But it is her honesty and integrity that will be the most valuable qualities, both of which are considerably lacking in my colleges. She is of the same opinion as myself with regards to Hicks Farm. That something needs to be done with it, but it has to be done within keeping of the scale and tradition of Throop Village. If an application goes to planning board that we are not happy with we will fight against it with everything we have.",

Well drink a pint of water, you’ve got work to do!\nThe first thing you are going to do is phone Lisa and check that yesterday wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t, perfect! Now you need to decide how what the plan is to work best for your residents.\nThe next couple of weeks you are going to see how the land lies, it’s been a dramatic result, and in your celebrations you haven’t quite realised what has just happened. You’ve got the opportunity to make a real change in the town you love. And everything seems so bright. You start conversations with the councillors you know. Simon Bull who was so fantastic with in your first year and half, and you’re going to form a group with him, Lisa and Chris, (who you don’t know so well yet, but you’ll love him despite the fact he supports Liverpool!) and you are going to form that group to protect the interests of Bournemouth. Suddenly by chance you are going to find yourself as the leader of this group going into negotiations with other groups to form the administration of the 12th largest council in the country. This is a big responsibility. Crazy I know. What’s crazier is the representative from Labour is going to say these meetings should start at 7am. So every morning for two weeks you are going to get up at six and get the bus to the town hall to sit in a room for hours and discuss shaping the future of this council.\nAnd these are surreal conversations, and you are going to fight your corner, be brave. There is no reason not to say how you feel, you owe nothing to anyone except those who voted for you and your group. These are strangers, who will become friends, but for now get everything off your chest. There is no room for formalities when you are speaking about what you believe in. And when you do you will realise that you have much more in common with the people in this room then you first thought and you will see their passion for these three towns. And as they decide on cabinet positions you are going to make the pitch of your life for Housing, because you got into politics to make sure everyone has a place they can call home.\nDon’t worry, your passion for the role will convince them. Incredibly you, yes you, are going to be the Cabinet Member for Housing. Finally you will be in a position to change things, though I need to warn you it won’t happen as quickly as you want or thought. But be patient, you are making a difference.\nThe first couple of months your head is going to be so filled with so much information that you won’t even be able to process it all initially. Take a lot of notes, but then read them, don’t just leave them like I know you will! Next you’ll travel, you know where best practice is, so go, write a letter to the y-foundation in Finland and tell them you are going there to learn about housing first. You’ll absolutely love it. Also the homeless World Cup is in Cardiff check it out!\nYou’ll spend the summer working, getting a grip on your portfolio, asking questions, having tours of the housing stock (there’s so much) meeting so many officers and organisations you’ll lose count. You’ll put forward plans to potentially purchase Holes Bay. You’ll start pushing your development team for social housing. You are going to be scrutinised, at times harshly, sometimes about your age, always about your ability. You’ll doubt yourself. You shouldn’t, you’re capable, and if you are doubting, remember that more people in Bournemouth voted for you than anyone else. You are going to work as hard as possible, to the point that you eat, sleep and breath it, you know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nBut take some time out to each day and week. Watch Home and Away, Neighbours and Doctors back to back with Mum, and really cherish that time. Please, enjoy those moments with her, don’t take them for granted. Tell her you love her, she knows, but please reminder her more often than you do.\nAnd suddenly you’re cooking with gas. Summer is fading but you’re excited, you’re starting to make decisions, you’re putting your stamp on your portfolio. Giving presentations to officers on your trip to Finland, influencing bids for rough sleeper grants, creating policies and helping those who the system has failed. You get much better at scrutiny as well you knock back the questions with comparative ease to when you first started. You’re going to be on a panel speaking at a Key Cities event about housing. For the first time since you’ve got role you are going to feel completely assured. Chest puffed out, head high.\nAnd this is where you are going to get your first bump in the road.\nDecember comes, a month you usually love, your birthday, Christmas. But this is going to be the worst month of your life and I doubt it will be beaten if you live for another 100 years. It’ll start on your birthday, you’ll accidentally see the girl you’ve been seeing with another boy and you’re little heart will ache. This will start a spiral of very unfortunate events. Mum’s condition will get worse, you’ll be woken up each morning at 4 as she struggles to climb the stairs. You’ll go to the General Election count, see the conservatives win a landslide, get drunk and do things you wish you hadn’t. Then on Boxing Day the doctor will tell you your mum has hours to live. You’ll spend 20 hours by her side waiting for her to pass. And in the last moments of her life, as her face changes, the pain you feel will be truly unbearable. And I won’t pretend to you it gets easier even as I write this I still replay it.\nSo many people loved mum, you’re going to get so much support from all over the world as well as here. Xavi, Carlos and Eli are going to come from Barcelona less than 48 hours later to make sure you are ok. Messages are going to flood in. You’ll feel loved. And you will need the love of hundreds of people to fill the gap she left. You’ll focus, push the pain aside momentarily and organise a beautiful send off with Dad and Cal. You won’t believe how many turn up. You’ll be overwhelmed.\nThen it gets hard, you’ll throw yourself back into work. You’ll be in meetings but you won’t really be there. For a few anyways. Eventually things will start to go back to some sort of normal. The grief will hang there, and you’ll bring it up when you’re alone. But while you’re not you’ll smile, even laugh when people ask you how you are. It’s not because that’s how you feel it’s because you really don’t know what to say. You’re going to go to a very dark place. But less than a month after the funeral you are going to drag yourself to be scrutinised in public once again. And although it won’t be your best performance, the fact that you did it will be such a huge achievement, looking back I have no idea how you do.\nSo then just as you start to get back in the swing, covid -19 hits! A global pandemic killing 28,000 people in the U.K. to date. I’m being serious. Honestly, it’s something we haven’t seen for a century. And you’re going to spend weeks in lockdown, in your house to save lives, and it is so important you respect that. It’ll be hard, and it’ll make you think so much about mum. The good news is you though you get a puppy just before, make sure you call him Nero, and working from home is quite nice. Your officers are incredible, they mobilise so quickly. During the crisis you and your team find accommodation for every rough sleeper.\nIt’s a scary time. But you have the support of the Unity Alliance, those people you don’t know yet but they are brilliant. Trust me. The future looks uncertain but really that is for me to deal with, not you. You just have to remember how lucky you are to do a job you enjoy, representing the area you were born and to have had a mum as beautiful as you did. I’ll write again in a year, hopefully things will be on the up. Oh yeah, and always look on the bright side (you’ll understand eventually).\nLove Kieron\nP.S. you also get a selfie (picture attached) with the Governor of the Bank of England who you originally thought was Keith from Sunderland. Long story, but again you’ll laugh hard when it happens.",

And I’m loving all of it. Well nearly all of it. I adore being your representative, l love working towards housing more people but I hate being a politician.\nLast month I went over to Finland and was so inspired to hear about the work they were doing in housing, both in dealing with homelessness, but also the issue of affordability, especially in terms of young people like myself. One organisation called NAL was a non-profit that provided high quality, truly affordable housing for those under the age of 30 who needed it. The UK is crying out for such an organisation.\nI also met with Juha Kaakinen the CEO of the Y-foundation. Another non-profit providing Housing First. His foundation has been the biggest factor in making Finland the only country in the EU where homelessness is on the decline. I could have listened to him all day, he had so much experience and knowledge. But there were two main differences I could see between our country and his. The first was the mentality towards housing, perceiving it as a basic human right rather than an investment or commodity. Secondly was that Finland had realised in order to house everyone you need houses, and that those houses have to be truly affordable. The few hours I spent in the company of these groups was invaluable. I left Finland, with books, notes and a number of ideas, feeling energised and optimistic about the future.\nBut that was short lived as I realised the opposition are determined politics gets in the way. Earlier this week I had to go in front of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to defend a two part report on Project Admiral. Project Admiral referring to a £20 million renovation of 4 council owned tower blocks agreed by the former borough of Poole, to improve fire safety standards, eliminate damp and make it a better place for people to live.\nThe first part was an open report that asked for £750,000 in order to buy back properties from leaseholders who have ill health or experiencing real financial hardships. The second part was exempt to the public for legal reasons, but was around what the leaseholders should pay per the section 20 of their lease.\nI received a rough ride and politics really played its part. Despite being well briefed, knowing I had come to the recommendations that I felt were best, I still came out with a few bruises. In fairness there were traps I shouldn’t have fell for, and bate I should of taken and with time I’m sure I won’t. However the conservative members weren’t there to add value, as they so often claim. If they were they would have suggested an option to take. Instead they just wanted to provide me with a few sleepless nights and they succeeded.\nThat O&S meeting really got me thinking, and that Monday night I really couldn’t sleep, twisting and turning over the arguments and the numerous scenarios put to me around the options in the exempt report. As well as the open one. However what eventually helped me get to sleep was the obvious fact that was staring me in the face the whole time, it’s a fact that’s not changed since I became a councillor. It’s why I am a Councillor.\nI am fundamentally different in my way of thinking to those who posed the arguments to me.\nMy main concerns when considering the options were fairness and how to keep a good relationship with leaseholders, to enable future access to properties when needed and ensuring they uphold their responsibility as Leaseholders. Whilst also minimising the risk of going to tribunal. Despite knowing we have an extremely strong case if brought in front of a judge.\nCertain members at the meeting described two classes when differentiating the leaseholders from those renting. Well I could only see one class. I could only see people who live in the same tower block who all have the same aspiration to live a good life how they want to, and all with their own pressures whether that be financial or health. All of whom will be affected by the works but all of whom will have a better place to live once those works are finished.\nOne member then went on to ask how other council tenants would feel about the money coming out of the HRA to support residents affected. Well speaking as a Council tenant I am fine with that. I understand that not every penny this council spends has to benefit me, and more over I can put myself in the shoes of those leaseholders, most of whom have become property rich but cash poor by trying to get a foot on the ladder, a stake in society, and I can sympathise with them being fronted by such a heavy bill.\nI didn’t come to the decision lightly, no one on the cabinet came to the decision lightly. I joked at the meeting, when posed with various outlandish scenarios that went from one extreme to another that ‘it’s my sword and I’ll fall on it’ well I was wrong, it’s my sword and I’ll raise it. We as a cabinet and an alliance are doing things differently now. And that’s good, in fact it’s great.\nWe are now more transparent and communicating better than any previous administration. One Conservative voting resident of mine asked ‘how come you’re so much better at communicating than the last lot?’ I said it’s because we want to talk to you. Just last week we had residents round the table talking about Hicks Farm with the local MP. That wouldn’t have been forthcoming previously.\nAnd so the next night after not being able to sleep the previous one I took a page out of Cllr David Brown’s book and went to play some of the craziest golf I’ve ever played with a lovely girl I’ve been seeing, I got home and I slept like a baby safe in the knowledge that this alliance cares about people rather than politics.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_10/content_29.html": "The last seven weeks have aged me seven years but felt like seven minutes. I have learned so much in such a short space of time regarding housing; tenures to freeholds via CPOs. It has been a crazy period that has seen me open landlord conferences’ and begin dialogue with developers. But what I have really learned over the last two months is just how important a house is. It is more than bricks and mortar, windows and doors, carpets and curtains. It is our foundation, our stability, which we as people rely upon. It can be both the solution and cause of our problems. It’s where we argue and make up. It is where we burn our microwave meals before watching Corrie with a cuppa. It is where we spend most of our short existence. It is for these very reasons we must start looking at homes, and housing itself, differently.\nWhich is why one of the first things I have done as Housing Portfolio Holder is to put a blanket ban on the term ‘units’. Inspired by Channel 4’s resident architect George Clarke who I met at Housing 2019 (a conference held in Manchester last month). The logic behind it is, that it is a developer’s term, which is clinical and devoid of emotion. In fact when I first started I wasn’t exactly sure what a unit was or what it measured; beds, people, number of rooms? When we talk about ‘units’ we are talking about numbers, we are talking about the storage of people and their things inside of four very static walls. Rather than talking about their lives, exploring their needs and experiences, and the dynamic nature of home life. Whilst our housing targets set out by national government require use to maximise space, it doesn’t mean that we can’t build quality with these things in mind.\nThis is just one of the many ways in which we need to change our approach to housing, not just as a council but as a nation. There needs to a new approach to developments, built to create communities, where happiness not overheads are prioritised. Where we are thriving not surviving. There has to be a change of mentality around social renting too, the stigma needs to stop. I live in the same estate now as I always have done, and I am fully aware of the labels attached to council housing. The best way that we can influence this is by building more of it, and making it superior to that in the private rented sector. Much of which already is. In places like Vienna living in social rented housing is the norm, we need that here, especially as people of my age are now being labelled ‘generation rent’. Being part of that is fine. Buying a house is not for everyone, nor should it be, renting is brilliant. But the current levels of rent are not.\nSocial rent was a hot topic as I tried to get my Princess Road development through Cabinet and Full Council last week, why wasn’t there any? Which was more than a fair comment. Viability was the main answer, £5.1 million gap in funding. And the scheme does offer so many of the things that I believe are the answer to our housing problems. Mixed tenure, mixed communities, and 72% affordable housing capped at the Local Housing Allowance. It will be excellent housing, excellently managed. The local policy only requires 40% at this moment in time, and that is almost never met in Private Sector developments. Which is something else that certainly needs to change. On the whole Princess Road is a good scheme, but it is just the start, it is the baseline to measure all future developments of that size upon.\nIn that same Full Council we also declared a climate emergency, an ambitious target that will see the council carbon neutral by 2030. This is a huge challenge, but one we must rise too. Housing is no exception; we need to be building more sustainable homes. We have 3 exemplar passive homes in West Howe, which are not only eco-friendly but have an increased building life and saw resident’s utility bills reduced significantly. These are fantastic. But 3 is simply not enough, we must be building more.\nThen there is the utilisation of limited land and utilising the housing we already have. A huge part of this is starting with brownfield sites, which is I was more than happy to put forward a proposal to unlock funding to create a site acquisition strategy for the Holes Bay Power Station in Poole. The power station came down in 1993; I wasn’t born. For the subsequent 26 years it has been of no use. We must be looking to these brownfield sites first, by trying to work with the private sector. However if it has to brought back into public ownership, through a negotiated purchase or compulsory purchase order, then this gives us a great opportunity to create something that meets all of the requirements I’ve set out over the last 5 paragraphs. And whilst only giving it a single line we really do need to look at ways of bring empty homes back into use.\nSo as you have read, there is a lot going on. Some of it I have a direct impact on, a lot of it I don’t. We are at a crossroads in Housing both as a conurbation and as a country. And there are so many reasons to be optimistic about it; people in the industry are providing the solutions. Now it is time for Governments to wake up from the housing coma we’ve been in over the last 40 years. Ultimately I believe everyone deserves a home, not a unit, which they can feel comfortable in, which they can afford, be that rented or owned. A place to hang their hat and cook their beans on toast.\nThis small change in wording is a huge change in mentality going forward. For me ‘how many units?’ is the measure I use nowadays whilst in town on a Friday to tell me when it is time to go home.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_14/content_49.html": "The curse of winning a by-election so close to the full elections is that as you’ve just started to find your feet you already have to start thinking about your next election. May 2019 might seem like a long way off, but when you have to plan an election and the number of electors that can vote for you has doubled, six months will go pretty quickly. So, I already have one eye on the next election. In my formative years I was part of the 34th Bournemouth Scout Group, where we were taught to ‘always be prepared’. By thinking about my election this far in advance, that is what I am trying to do.\nPart of that preparation is looking for candidates to run with me in the ward, the next election will more than likely see the merging of Throop, Muscliff and Strouden Park, doubling the electorate and cutting the number of seats from six to three. I want to see good people take those seats and I also want a reduction in the party politics we experience in local government. Too many times, even in my short time as a councillor, many at the council have put politics ahead of you and your needs, which quite frankly that isn’t acceptable.\nSo I want to talk to you about Lisa who I have asked to run with me next year. Some of you may know her better as Lisa Northover and I am sure many of you will have already voted for her when she stood in the 2010 General Election as a Liberal Democrat candidate acquiring 13,592 votes. Between 2007 and 2011, Lisa was elected as the councillor for Boscombe West. During her period as a councillor, she did so much for her residents. Throughout the years, she has campaigned locally on housing issues resulting in positive action, many of which have improved local peoples living conditions. Lisa has also run several community projects including one to plant 500 fruit trees in our town. She has lived in Bournemouth her whole life, works for a local charity, and was also a Non Executive Director of a local NHS Trust.\nWhilst all of this makes for an impressive CV, this stuff isn’t why I want Lisa to run with me. If she had no previous experience and she hadn’t improved the lives of so many in her ward in the past, it would make no difference to me. That is because Lisa is everything someone representing you should be. She is intelligent, caring and fierce when she needs to be. Lisa is one of the main reasons I became a councillor. My election team was made up of just three people; me, my father, who would deliver leaflets when he could, and Lisa, who designed my leaflets and guided me through the campaign. In fact, she was the one who encouraged me to run in the first place. She was only ever a message away and was always ready with an answer or solution I could use. Which is exactly what you need from a councillor, right?\nJust like Anne Rey, Lisa used to be a Lib Dem and just like Anne Rey, she has become disillusioned with the party politics that have eroded democracy within this town. Over the last ten years, the conservative party has dominated the make up of the council – currently they are 51 of the 54 councillors – yet many feel that things within the town are getting worse. Homelessness, anti-social behaviour, and in my ward there is a serious problem with parking. This summer around Kingfisher Barn, there has been ridiculous amounts of litter and reports of abusing the natural environment. Whilst I have tried to listen and put your problems forward, without the support of councillors who have no agenda around me, my hands have at times been tied. I am approaching my eleventh month in the role and even in this short time, I have learned a lot, but the main thing I have learnt is that there are not enough councillors with the characteristics that Lisa possesses, and it is you who is suffering because of it. So, I am proud to announce that Lisa is running with me in the next election and when we both get elected, we will be a dynamic duo not to be messed with.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_5/content_33.html": "The Tories leadership are back to playing politics, nothing unusual there. But to do it in the midst of a global pandemic, a pandemic in which their national government’s response has been so poor, after the death of one of our councillors, is quite something. We are living in unprecedented times, so I guess it is quite reassuring to see somethings still don’t change. But this power play has come at the worst time, when we all need to focus on getting through the rest of this crisis, and managing a delicate recovery. It’s an unnecessary and crass distraction.\nIn the ridiculous press release announcing their attempt to gain power they planted a few slogans and phrases that I’m sure we will be seeing more of over the next week as this plays out. One of really witty phrases was one calling the cabinet, a ‘cabinet of compromise’ *sighs*. Which I bet they thought was genius. As if compromising is the worst possible quality decision makers could possess. I think compromise is only truly unacceptable to a tyrant or a dictator. Go figure. I’ve already seen a number of opposition councillors regurgitate it on the twitter feeds.\nWell I would like to take you behind the scenes of that cabinet, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to rename it, ‘the cabinet of cool’. The re-brand is equally as awful and cringe as their’s, I admit, but there are very few adjectives beginning with ‘C’ that so perfectly describe the cabinet. As pulled from Wikipedia the definition Coolness is an ascetic of attitude, behavior, appearance and style which is generally admired. It has associations with self control and composure. Which are exactly the qualities you need when making difficult decisions under pressure. So I want to take you through each cabinet member and explain to you what makes them so damn cool.\nI’m going to start with Dr. Felicity Rice, or as she will insist you call her, Fizz. There is nothing cooler in this life than being 100% true to who you are, and she does this. She is the cabinet’s conscience, she pushes us to really consider the effects of all of our decisions, she makes sure we weigh up the consequences in the short and long term, the impact on the environment and climate change, her portfolio, and how we can do things better in all aspects. Which are the qualities we need in creating a better place to live after the crisis.\nNext up is the funniest cabinet member, Lesley Dedman, she’s absolutely and utterly brilliant, her humour is razor sharp and she can cut an opponent in a debate with one line. She is never fazed by anything which so important, especially as she has been in charge of the most important portfolio during this pandemic, Adult Health and social care and done a phenomenal job. Cool? She drives a Jag and dresses as though she edits vogue. Enough said.\nDavid Brown, or as I like to call him, Casanova, he’s very romantic and we can be often found chatting about our love lives or lack of them. He is calculated, he weighs up risk, balancing it with reward, the perfect person to be in charge of the finance portfolio. His coolness is questionable due to the large collection of Star Trek memorabilia he sells. But it’s very cool he has a heart of gold, because if this government doesn’t support local councils adequately, we can cut it out and sell it.\nAndy Hadley, is one of the cleverest people I know. His knowledge of his Transport portfolio is second to none. Bournemouth has the worst congestion of any town in this country, thanks to the previous administration. Andy is the man to change that. He’s very cool, got a Back to the Future Doc Brown vibe, but the intelligence to back it up, could make socks and sandals look good.\nNot giving up is the hallmark of a champion, and Lewis Alison could have easily thrown in the towel after his first six months in the role. The most inexperienced of us, faced what could probably be described as bullying by some Tories, but dug in, stuck at it, and now made the real strides in his Tourism and Leisure portfolio. Big ideas for the future of tourism in a post-covid world. He’s made of the right stuff, and when going the got tough he got going. Ice cool.\nMargret Phipps, in charge of strategic planning, cares about the green belt and preserving it. She always says what she believes, which is exactly what you want from someone representing you. She has a vast amount of experience to call upon, which is handy for those without. She also has horses which is very cool, and I hope she reads this because I’d really like to meet them when the virus is gone.\nSandra Moore, looks after the children’s portfolio, and she is an encyclopaedia of local knowledge. She knows so many stories of the three towns past, and knowing your history is so important in shaping the future. Can enjoy a good moan, but always ends up laughing at the end of it. Very cool, younger than her years, only problem is she prefers Cats to Dogs. Nero wasn’t impressed.\nMark Howell lives and breaths regeneration his portfolio, has a strong vision to revitalise our town centres but wants to be inclusive. He welcomes challenges and accepts new ideas better than his own. Very excited to work with him on Holes Bay, a Housing project with so much potential. At the last election he strolled in wearing an outfit that would have made Willy Wonka blush, came out re-elected, only he could pull it off. That’s cool.\nThen there is our leader Vikki Slade. My favourite band is the Stone Roses, who coined the name after wanting to get the perfect balance of soft and hard. And that’s what Vikki is, she cares so very deeply about every single one of you, but she’s ready to make difficult decisions and to defend challenges against the Tories. She has so much energy I don’t know where she gets it from. And of course she is cool, I’ve just compared her to the coolest band in the world.\nFinally there’s me. Well somebody has to make the tea, take notes and tell jokes, right?\nYou know what is really cool is that we are a team, a diverse collective, from all walks of life, each with our own style. And we don’t compromise, we challenge each other to come to the best possible conclusion for you. Always looking to improve and learn. We don’t start from the conservative presumption that we are right and that is that. We weight it all up. We consider it. And we take action. It is calm and composed, some might even say cool. It’s the best governance this conurbation has ever seen. Led by the best leader this conurbation has ever seen.\nShe’ll carry on through it all, she’s a waterfall. – Stone Roses",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_11/content_57.html": "A year and a half ago when I won my by-election I was in earshot of a conservative Councillor stating ‘He’ll be a lamb to the slaughter’ I’ve never forgotten it and I never will. Since then I’ve held the Tories to account, won another election gaining the most votes in Bournemouth, and last night I became the portfolio holder for Housing and Deputy Leader of an administration that kicked the tories out of power. If this is how lambs get slaughtered I no longer need to be a vegetarian.\nWhat was achieved over the last few weeks was no small feat. People will probably never understand just how hard it was. Bringing together five different groups, from all backgrounds, ages and politics, to work together was never going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is right? The 7:00 am meetings, the sleeplessness nights, and seemingly endless talks, at times were a struggle. But this Unity Alliance has so much more uniting us than dividing us. We are all centred around the common goal of leaving the conurbation in a much better state than we left it, we care about the environment, we want transparency, openness and inclusiveness. Not just amongst councillors, but with you as residents. We work for you, people before politics, partnership over partisanship. Be under no illusions though the next four years are going to be tough. The tories will jump on any mistake, and exaggerate it no end. They’ll scrutinise, as they should, and it will be our job to make sure we are up to that scrutiny.\nThis is an opportunity of a lifetime, one that I never thought would come along. Exactly two years ago I was running in the General Election, my main pledge was to try and find a solution to ending homelessness and rough sleeping within Bournemouth. I didn’t feel there was a political will to do so. Now I’m in a position to do that. I can’t quite believe it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have all the answers, but there is certainly no one in this town who is more committed to find those answers than me.\nIt would be so wrong of me to sit here and pretend that this is my victory, it’s not, it’s yours. I am nothing without your support and of course your votes. And I haven’t had a chance to thank everyone who voted for myself and Lisa. We worked so hard during the campaign and you guys recognised that. You voted for change and you’ve got it. You’re no longer shouting into the wind, instead you are in power alongside us. And it’s genuinely exciting. The next four years aren’t going to be a stroll in the park, but we are setting out with the very best of intentions and that’s more than can be said about previous administrations.\nI want wrap up this post by thanking Vikki (she’s going to be a fantastic leader), Mark, Margret, Fizz, George, Stephen and all of those that went into talks a week ago with an open mind, willing to listen and compromise when needed. I want to thank Simon, Chris and Lisa for putting their faith in me as the Group Leader of the Bournemouth Group, to fight for the interests of their residents and of Bournemouth itself. We can’t say for certain what the next four years will bring, but I can say that I’ve never been more excited for the future of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch.",

The story is always quite close to my heart, but it rose to the surface recently after the work we as a Council and Homelessness Partnership have done to significantly reduce our reliance on Bed and Breakfast (B&B) accommodation.\nB&B accommodation is the most challenging to live in; there often isn’t a suitable space for a child to do their homework or facilities for parents to cook decent meals. It really doesn’t have the conditions for a family to live and thrive as they should. It is a last resort and our dependence on it was costly to the welfare of the families living in it. I can imagine Little Bear not fully understanding why he’s in this strange place, without all his toys around him. And wondering why Big Bear is so worried?\nSo at the back end of last year we made a conscious decision, in agreement with the Homelessness Partnership, that we had to tackle this issue head on. We decided to acquire over 100 proper homes as a form of temporary accommodation. Somewhere that Big Bear can cook a Christmas dinner and put tree up for Little Bear.\nAlongside the acquisitions of homes we also put more focus on prevention. In doing this we had an increase of 30% in successfully keeping families in their home. And that is in a backdrop of a 13% increase in those coming to the council at risk of homelessness.\nWhat was the outcome of all this work? A 90% reduction in the course of a year in our use of B&B accommodation. Which is phenomenal, in a context where nationally we are seeing substantial rises in the use of B&B’s. At its peak not long after I took the role there were around 230 Children in B&B’s. Christmas Day last year we had 164 Children. Two days ago when we put out a press release we had 16. Today we have 14 Children in B&B, the number keeps dropping. And whilst it is still 14 too many, the reduction is such a source of pride for us. And I can only thank everyone that has made it happen.

This a new blog from Kieron Wilson Independent Councillor for Throop and Muscliff, giving you an insight into what is happening at your council, as well as addressing the issues that matter in Bournemouth.\nGood company in a journey makes the way seem shorter. — Izaak Walton",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_2/content_12.html": "It’s been a while, I hope you are all taking care during these difficult times.\nWe are in such a hard moment, as an area and as a country, and at times there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel. So during this period you have to take whatever little victories and joys you can and last week there was a fantastic one. It was announced that the BCP Council would be part of the new cohort of the What Works Community ran by the Centre for Homelessness Impact. CHI are an incredible organisation whose objective is to use evidence and data to bring about a sustainable end to homelessness.\nI first encountered the Centre for Homelessness Impact at Housing 2019, when I went to a seminar in which the Chief Executive, Ligia Teixeria, gave a brilliant presentation on the work being done by the organization. Ever since I have used their website as a resource. I think there are similarities between the council and CHI, we are new, bright, innovative organisations with a passion to end homelessness. At the back end of last year we joined CHI and Cardiff University in a smaller research project that looked at what we did over the course of the first lockdown with the intention of improving the outcomes of those we were providing services to, which is still on going.\nHomelessness and all it encompasses has often been a subject that has been overlooked when it comes to studying and understanding it, particularly when it comes to policy making. The work they do is so vital. That is why one of my last acts as the Cabinet Member for Housing was to write to the Chief Executive of the Council to get authorisation to be part of the What Works Community scheme.\nSpanning the fields of behavioural insights, design thinking and data-informed decision making, the programme supports local authorities to develop a culture of continuous innovation, and enhance their ability to use evidence and data to tackle homelessness by focusing on ‘what works’ – https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/community\nBy being a part of this it places Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole quite literally on the map in terms of being a leader in homeless services, but also enables the council to feed into the evidence base that will decide future policy, and that is vital. Although there has been a change of administration, there doesn’t seem yet to have been a change in direction in the approach to homelessness, which is positive and a credit to the new lead on homelessness. Though I will be keeping a close eye to make sure we continue to head in the right direction, I think the administration understand the great work we were doing in housing and homelessness (below are a list of some of the Key successes we had over the last 12 months) and know it would be foolish to divert course.\nThe last few months have been odd for me, after losing my role as Cabinet Member for Housing, especially when it wasn’t for doing a poor job, which would have been much easier to accept. I went from a not having any time to myself, to nearly only having time to myself, though that soon changed again. I am still doing a lot of work in the ward, helping businesses receive their discretionary grants, sorting disputes out between residents and the council on many different subjects, going to every sub-group of the Homelessness Partnership under the sun and so much more.\nTomorrow I will be in attendance at the final All Party Parliamentary Group on Ending Homeless listening to some of my heroes in the sector explain to a panel Co-Chaired by Bob Blackman MP and Neil Coyle MP, about what needs to be done to eradicate homelessness within the country, which I am really excited about. Yet it still isn’t that same intensity as to when I was in the hot-seat.\nAnd in many ways I am grateful for that, it has been the first time I’ve been able to take some time out in a very challenging year and half, and -pun absolutely intended- I have been able to do what works for me to get through a tough time.\nKey successes\n• Overall reduction in Rough Sleeping across the conurbation\n• 1215 households prevented from homelessness in past 12 months\n• The Homeless Reduction Board and Homelessness Partnership launched. Over 60 organisations and services are involved with well over 100 individuals, with several focussed Action Groups.\n• The launch of the Homelessness Forum, increasing opportunities for collaboration, communication and consistent working.\n• Successful Let’s Talk Renting campaign to encourage early action in terms of prevention. This was a multi-agency approach to ensure maximum reach and success and is now being followed up by a Let’s Talk Money campaign.\n• A new Hospital Homeless Pathway team has been launched to provide better support and outcomes for people in hospital who are at risk of homelessness upon discharge. This multidisciplinary team includes housing, and this followed a pilot funded initially by the MHCLG Cold Weather Fund.\n• The BCP response to the Everyone In initiative during the Covid-19 pandemic has been recognised as very successful. This recognition belongs to all of the many agencies who were, and remain, part of this effort delivering collaborative support in health, substance dependency and food provision to just name a few examples.\n• Over 300 individuals placed in Emergency Accommodation as part of Everyone In, with more than 80 moved on to longer term accommodation.\n• Everyone who has been placed in emergency accommodation has had a thorough assessment of their housing, health and support needs, as part of ensuring that the best solutions are found for everyone.\n• A multi-agency Rough Sleeping Pathway has been a vital part of this approach, with an integrated working approach with various agencies working alongside the Local Authority Housing Team. This work will continue to be developed.\n• Development of working group considering local approach to accommodating people with No Recourse to Public Funds\n• Current review and refresh of Severe Weather Emergency Procedure (SWEP) Protocol via task and finish group.\n• Successful soft launch of Operation Luscombe in June 2020 to address begging and related antisocial behaviour, including by those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation. This is a support-led model although can result in enforcement as a last resort.\n• Imminent pilot launch of Contactless Giving scheme. This will allow members of the public who wish to donate in order to help those who are homeless, including those rough sleeping, by swiping their credit or debit card at several locations in the town centre of Bournemouth. This scheme will expand to the rest of the BCP area in due course. Funds go to Dorset Community Fund, who distribute to those in need, and all proceeds go to those affected by homelessness; all overhead have been covered by the Homelessness Partnership.\n• Lived experience group established collating feedback about their experience of local services\n• Rough Sleepers Initiative Grant fund award £1.4m\n• Next Steps Accommodation Programme grant fund award\n• A Housing First Service Level Agreement in place and property portfolio increased\n• Additional provision commissioned doubling the weekly capacity of the Health Bus which caters for those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation.\n• Two Drug and Alcohol workers assigned to working with those in the Rough Sleeping Pathway, offering tailored interventions and support.\n• Imminent launch of new multi-agency group, Complex Homelessness & Risk Integrated Solutions Panel (CHRISP) to focus on complex cases and building on 3 legacy groups\n• BCP-wide single point of contact for financial help organised through Financial Resilience action group\n• Additional food support for those w/o access to food in Temporary Accommodation organised via faith/voluntary community\n• Community support action group aligning both move-on support and training opportunities",

Last Friday I was hosting the Conservative Minister for Rough Sleeping and Homelessness, who came down to see the exemplary work we have been doing for those vulnerable on our street. This Friday I am looking at losing my role, as last night the Conservatives put in another Vote of No Confidence. I always felt it was only a matter of time after the passing of my colleague and friend Pete Parish.\nSome part of me, is wondering if it is worth fighting, without the opportunity for by elections the numbers are not in our favour it seems, and I am a bit knackered if truth be told. It is hard at the top, and the conservatives are nothing if not relentless, biting at our heals. But having watched the Overview and Scrutiny meeting last week, and having experienced first hand the discourse and attitude some opposition members have towards those who are homeless in our community, I know that even if there is only a slim chance, we have to fight.\nBelieving that fining those who have do not have proper place to stay is a good idea, instantly drains my confidence in them. I had a lot of friends message to say this can’t be happening. And even in the face of the national outrage that was caused, a number of MP’s across the country even tweeted about it with a link to a Guardian article, they stuck by that line. During my time as the Housing Portfolio Holder there has been fantastic partnership working, which has led to great results, for the year 19/20, we saw a 37% rise in positive outcomes for those who were homeless. And the 20/21 figure will be much higher after our work during Covid. Ministers, especially ones from opposition parties, don’t come and visit often, so when they do you know you are doing something right.\nThat is not to say there isn’t a lot more work to be done, I feel responsible when I see or hear about anyone who doesn’t have a roof over their head in this conurbation. Yet, nationally the legislation needs to change, as do attitudes, something I mentioned to the Minster. He was extremely positive about the work, myself, my team and partner agencies had done during the pandemic, and indicated there is a good chance our Next Steps Accommodation Programme Bid, which totals over £5 million will be accepted due to our success so far. This will make such a difference to so many lives. Those on our streets have to be treated with compassion, not punished with draconian measures as the Tories recommended. And whilst the minister nationally seems to understand that, locally it is a different story.\nWhether or not I am the Portfolio Holder for Housing at the end of this month, the work we as a BCP Homelessness partnership has to continue. It is too important not to, but I fear it will be lost with a change of administration. Prevention is just as important in addressing the issue. There is no appetite for Social Housing in the opposition, I brought forward the first homes at social rent in over 20 years in Bournemouth, and this is a key driver in preventing homelessness, and improving quality of life for so many of our families.\nIf we lose this vote of no confidence it is not me I am worried about, a break will do me the world of good, I’ve given everything I have to this role for the last year and a half. I am worried about those still on our streets, who won’t be helped but hindered, not housed but fined.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_12/content_58.html": "A year ago today 533 of you lovely people voted for me to become your representative on Bournemouth Borough Council. I remember that day with such clarity, the weather was fairly grim, it was cold, because of which I certainly hadn’t anticipated so many of you going to the polls to vote for me. I spent the first part of the morning delivering my last few letters with my Dad, then in the afternoon, I went back home to play FIFA 18 to calm both my excitement and my nerves for the evening ahead. When I arrived at the Town Hall for the results I was greeted by a council officer who thought I was a counting agent not a candidate. But after the counting began it was clear that I was not only a candidate but a contender. It is an incredibly surreal feeling seeing ballot paper after ballot paper with a cross by your name. When it had become clear that I had won, by a margin of 22 votes, or a football match as I like to think of it, the pride I felt was inexplicable.\nA year on I still have that extreme sense of pride, and I still haven’t got used to people calling me Councillor, I probably never will. But one thing have started to get used to in this past year is the way that local government operates, and I have begun to understand its flaws, of which there are many. Firstly there is procedures and archaic ceremonies which put you instantly on the back foot as young candidate, whether designed to intimidate or not they certainly have that effect, there are so many points of order that you spend as much time worrying about getting those right then you do the matter at hand. But these are nothing compared to the way the council actually conducts business with in the chamber at Full Council meetings, Cabinet decisions are passed with no effort at all. Councillors will often describe consensus on motions such as ‘We should be reducing plastic usage in the council’ as a debate. It is not a debate Councillor if everyone agrees it is a good idea and that it should have been implemented years ago.\nThen there are the staged questions that councillors, who are obviously conservative because there aren’t really any others, par take in. The ‘Can someone one tell me what we are doing about this very minor issue?’ questions. To which a portfolio holder replies ‘Oh it’s funny you should ask that question we just did something to look good about it yesterday and I have this answer that will not only allow me to show off, get in the echo, but also allow me a few digs at Labour, Lib Dems or any other party who dare question us’. I so often get disillusioned with the Full Council meetings. Pre-arranged questions with pre-arranged answers, never written by the councillors themselves but the hard working officers.\nThere is no debate, no dialogue, no authenticity in the council, and especially among the councillors themselves. Don’t get me wrong, there are a number of hardworking, honest councillors who despite their ideological persuasions I would be happy to see elected again, however there isn’t nearly as many as there should be. However in May we have the chance to change things, not only the council’s composition in terms of which party they represent, but with the merging of Christchurch, Poole and Bournemouth Councils we have the chance to change the way it operates. That is such an exciting prospect. But things won’t change if we keep voting conservative as a town. Einstein, whom I am led to believe was quite intelligent, said ‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.’ There needs to be more accountability in our local government, whilst conservatives have had it too easy for too long. What they want happens, and who is it benefiting, rough sleeping and homelessness have increased so much over the last ten years in Bournemouth whilst they have been in Government locally. They argue they are doing the best they can with their hands financially tied from national government, yet they wear the name and emblem of those keeping them captive, it’s Stockholm syndrome at its worse.\nHomelessness is the very visible failure of the conservative government both nationally and locally, but on top of that you have the paradoxical stance of wanting to protect greenbelt land at all costs with willing building on greenbelt land if there’s no cost. At the end of this month it’s almost certain that the A338 Wessex Fields scheme will be granted permission, despite its obvious flaws, because there is a huge grant coming from central government that can only be spent on that.\nI want to end this on a brighter note by saying thank you to those who voted for me a year ago today. It was a special night, and one that reflecting on will always bring a smile to my face. In the subsequent year I have given it my all to represent you, I know there’s more I could have done, and I know there is much more still to do. As we head towards May 2nd I would obviously love you to vote for me again, and for Lisa for the first time, but I really urge everyone in Bournemouth to think about who they are voting for. It’s time to end the insanity.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_16/content_68.html": "‘Hi Ian See you have seen this one, need to play this close to us, not our job to help the green independents, received a few emails’\nIt’s been just over five months since I was elected to be Throop and Muscliff’s Councillor to proceed the energetic and hardworking Councillor, now Alderman, Anne Rey. Big shoes to fill. It has been quite a five months too, with very little time to take a breath. When I was first elected one commenter said that ‘he’ll be a lamb to the wolves’, in my time so far I would describe myself more as a cat amongst the pigeons.\nI haven’t been afraid to speak or do what I thought was right, in my first full council meeting I was the only councillor who voted against the rise in Council Tax to the maximum allowed; 5.99%. I fought for my seat on the Standards Committee to ensure opposition, formed a political group with Green Party candidate Simon Bull to make sure the Conservatives can’t go behind our backs. I redrew the proposed boundaries for Queens Park and Strouden Park to protect both areas identity and in October I will become the youngest Group Leader in the history of Bournemouth Council. Most recently I called out the Mayor for ‘playing’ politics. It is quite literally the word he used when he sent an email by mistake to a resident. Politics is not a game. It is people’s lives and that can often be lost when we are sat round tables at the Pavilion sipping a class of prosecco making a toast to the new Mayor.\nEveryone is prone to mistakes, in the first full meeting when I voted against Council Tax, I also voted against the budget, believing that since a lot of the budget is made up of Council Tax, it didn’t make sense to vote for one and not the other. Councillor Lawerence Williams, the then Mayor, told me after the meeting that he could have stopped the meeting and asked me for an ‘alternative budget’. He was kind not to, they take around six months to produce, it would have been embarrassing. But what the new Mayor Derek Borthwick did was cynical and machiavellian, not technical, like my mistake, but intentional. He wanted to ‘play this close’ keep others out, namely ‘Green Independents’, and I called him on it in the Echo. Being the Mayor is a non-political role, unbiased, a ceremonial position to be the first citizen of Bournemouth, but even regardless of that fact, it is bad practice to keep ‘things close’ in what we consider as an open democracy.\nThe Mayor offered, in the Echo, to give me an apology, and I haven’t taken him up on it. Not because I am petty, but because I really don’t feel it is me he should be apologising to, it should be the residents that help pay for his chauffeur.\nSince the article we met on two occasions, both very amicable, I felt what’s done is done. The second occasion was at the TMSTH Area Forum, a productive meeting with residents, they normally are. During the meeting a number of people put forward an issue regarding the Number 4 Yellow Bus that had stopped going to Bournemouth Hospital, instead terminating at Castlepoint. Not only is it important for many older residents to get to the hospital, but it is also a main bus stop to go to places such as Salisbury for a day out. I took the microphone and suggested that myself, Mayor Borthwick and fellow ward Councillor Ian Clark should arrange a meeting with the Yellow Buses and the effected residents, to try to convince them to extend that service a few stops. It is not a huge ask, and would make the world of difference to a number of residents. Both seemed keen when put on the spot, I said I would email them later that night, which is what I did.\nThe reply I received the next morning astounded me.\nDear Councillor Wilson\nAfter our meeting last evening I was made aware by Derek Borthwick of your recent article in the Bournemouth Echo concerning the Mayor. I find it completely outrageous that you should disrespect the Mayor of Bournemouth in this way especially in his first weeks of office.\nI will not be prepared to work with you on any local matters until you make a public apology to The Mayor of Bournemouth.\nRegards Ian\nAt first I laughed, then I checked the date, no it wasn’t the first of April, he was serious. I sat there staring at it for five minutes, gobsmacked, but then I felt my blood starting to boil. He is willing to put politics before his residents and their very simple cause, at least the Mayor was trying to hide his intentions.\nHim wanting me to apologise for exposing wrong doing I just found hilarious.\nHim not wanting to work with me for the benefit of residents I found ridiculous.\nAt the top of the piece I mentioned some of the things I’ve done as a councillor, that stuff accounts for around 10% of what I have actually done. That’s the more glamorous side of it. The other 90% is the real work. It is answering your emails, putting forward questions to council on your behalf. It is going round your house for a cup of tea and a chat, not always having the solutions to your problems, but always being an ear to bend. It is fixing streetlights, and fighting excessive rent rises. It is objecting to planning applications and attending meetings. It is smiling when someone says to you ‘it’s nice to see someone younger getting involved’ and it is trying to live up to Ron and Anne. It is working for you a resident of Bournemouth, and more specifically Throop and Muscliff. And I have felt privileged every second since I was elected to represent you.\nSo when some uses you, the resident, as a political hostage, to try to make me apologise, well ‘I find it completely outrageous’.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2020_02_25_the-bright-side/content_25.html": "The first blog was always going to be the hardest. Since my last a lot of bad things have happened, by far the worst of which was my mum, whom many of you reading this will know, passed away. She was my best friend, my angel. She wasn’t really into politics, except when I was running. She didn’t care particularly for the left or right, she only knew to be kind. That is what I’ve always tried to do, though my success rate has never been as high as her’s.\nThe last two months have been a battle, I haven’t taken any leave because I was really not sure I would be able to start again if I stopped. And actually continuing to work has really helped. The support of fellow councillors has been so good, and I am enterally grateful to the members of my group, the cabinet, officers and the whole of the Unity Alliance, along with a number of conservatives who have been really good to me. At her funeral the music we said goodbye to her with was the song her and my dad had their first dance to after they were married ‘Always Look on the Bright Side of Life’, Monty Python’s classic, and that is because she always did. Even when life was jolly rotten, she continued smiling through, and that is what I have to do.\nLast week I sat in front of the Overview and Scrutiny committee presenting my first Housing Revenue Account Budget, it was exactly a month after my Mum’s funeral and getting up to the table to speak was a huge achievement for me. What I presented was a forward thinking paper which set out plans on how we will use HRA funding to deliver more and improved housing, that meets local needs, addresses affordability issues driving the housing crisis, supports measures around tackling homelessness and drives work around the sustainability of the stock ensuring it is fit for purpose for not just now but 50 years time. And whilst getting those words out, felt like climbing Everest barefoot, when I did it felt so good.\nAt the minute I am up and down, and when I am down I am really down, but I think it is very natural. To lose your best friend, the one person who loves you unconditionally is so hard, and it is really just starting to sink in. But I know that mum would want me to be positive, and that she would want me to carry on, working hard, and trying to help improve people’s lives in whatever way possible. Whether that was through building more social rented housing or just having time to chat them to talk through their problems.\nTomorrow would have been her 63rd Birthday, instead of being in the house with her watching channel 5 movies and eating rubbish, I will be at the Homelessness Reduction Board, continuing the collaborative work we have started to bring an end to homelessness, it is what she would have loved me to be doing.\nI want to thank everyone who has supported me throughout. It is really hard of course and it will be for a while, but I’ll get there. As they say when you’re chewing on life’s gristle, Don’t grumble, give a whistle! And this’ll help things turn out for the best.\nDu, Du, Du du du!\nLove you mum x",

That is why one of my last acts as the Cabinet Member for Housing was to write to the Chief Executive of the Council to get authorisation to be part of the What Works Community scheme.\nSpanning the fields of behavioural insights, design thinking and data-informed decision making, the programme supports local authorities to develop a culture of continuous innovation, and enhance their ability to use evidence and data to tackle homelessness by focusing on ‘what works’ – https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/community\nBy being a part of this it places Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole quite literally on the map in terms of being a leader in homeless services, but also enables the council to feed into the evidence base that will decide future policy, and that is vital. Although there has been a change of administration, there doesn’t seem yet to have been a change in direction in the approach to homelessness, which is positive and a credit to the new lead on homelessness. Though I will be keeping a close eye to make sure we continue to head in the right direction, I think the administration understand the great work we were doing in housing and homelessness (below are a list of some of the Key successes we had over the last 12 months) and know it would be foolish to divert course.\nThe last few months have been odd for me, after losing my role as Cabinet Member for Housing, especially when it wasn’t for doing a poor job, which would have been much easier to accept. I went from a not having any time to myself, to nearly only having time to myself, though that soon changed again. I am still doing a lot of work in the ward, helping businesses receive their discretionary grants, sorting disputes out between residents and the council on many different subjects, going to every sub-group of the Homelessness Partnership under the sun and so much more.\nTomorrow I will be in attendance at the final All Party Parliamentary Group on Ending Homeless listening to some of my heroes in the sector explain to a panel Co-Chaired by Bob Blackman MP and Neil Coyle MP, about what needs to be done to eradicate homelessness within the country, which I am really excited about. Yet it still isn’t that same intensity as to when I was in the hot-seat.\nAnd in many ways I am grateful for that, it has been the first time I’ve been able to take some time out in a very challenging year and half, and -pun absolutely intended- I have been able to do what works for me to get through a tough time.\nKey successes\n• Overall reduction in Rough Sleeping across the conurbation\n• 1215 households prevented from homelessness in past 12 months\n• The Homeless Reduction Board and Homelessness Partnership launched. Over 60 organisations and services are involved with well over 100 individuals, with several focussed Action Groups.\n• The launch of the Homelessness Forum, increasing opportunities for collaboration, communication and consistent working.\n• Successful Let’s Talk Renting campaign to encourage early action in terms of prevention. This was a multi-agency approach to ensure maximum reach and success and is now being followed up by a Let’s Talk Money campaign.\n• A new Hospital Homeless Pathway team has been launched to provide better support and outcomes for people in hospital who are at risk of homelessness upon discharge. This multidisciplinary team includes housing, and this followed a pilot funded initially by the MHCLG Cold Weather Fund.\n• The BCP response to the Everyone In initiative during the Covid-19 pandemic has been recognised as very successful. This recognition belongs to all of the many agencies who were, and remain, part of this effort delivering collaborative support in health, substance dependency and food provision to just name a few examples.\n• Over 300 individuals placed in Emergency Accommodation as part of Everyone In, with more than 80 moved on to longer term accommodation.\n• Everyone who has been placed in emergency accommodation has had a thorough assessment of their housing, health and support needs, as part of ensuring that the best solutions are found for everyone.\n• A multi-agency Rough Sleeping Pathway has been a vital part of this approach, with an integrated working approach with various agencies working alongside the Local Authority Housing Team. This work will continue to be developed.\n• Development of working group considering local approach to accommodating people with No Recourse to Public Funds\n• Current review and refresh of Severe Weather Emergency Procedure (SWEP) Protocol via task and finish group.\n• Successful soft launch of Operation Luscombe in June 2020 to address begging and related antisocial behaviour, including by those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation. This is a support-led model although can result in enforcement as a last resort.\n• Imminent pilot launch of Contactless Giving scheme. This will allow members of the public who wish to donate in order to help those who are homeless, including those rough sleeping, by swiping their credit or debit card at several locations in the town centre of Bournemouth. This scheme will expand to the rest of the BCP area in due course. Funds go to Dorset Community Fund, who distribute to those in need, and all proceeds go to those affected by homelessness; all overhead have been covered by the Homelessness Partnership.\n• Lived experience group established collating feedback about their experience of local services\n• Rough Sleepers Initiative Grant fund award £1.4m\n• Next Steps Accommodation Programme grant fund award\n• A Housing First Service Level Agreement in place and property portfolio increased\n• Additional provision commissioned doubling the weekly capacity of the Health Bus which caters for those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation.\n• Two Drug and Alcohol workers assigned to working with those in the Rough Sleeping Pathway, offering tailored interventions and support.\n• Imminent launch of new multi-agency group, Complex Homelessness & Risk Integrated Solutions Panel (CHRISP) to focus on complex cases and building on 3 legacy groups\n• BCP-wide single point of contact for financial help organised through Financial Resilience action group\n• Additional food support for those w/o access to food in Temporary Accommodation organised via faith/voluntary community\n• Community support action group aligning both move-on support and training opportunities",

It’s as long as Donald Trump got in the White House and a year longer than Theresa May got as Prime Minister. And so to mark the occasion I wanted to reflect, and write a long overdue piece for my blog.\nI won my first election by 22 votes, or as I like to think of it, a football match. Wearing an horrendous donkey jacket and a green knitted fleece which couldn’t have looked worse if I tried (evidence supplied below), I became the youngest member of the council. And straight away I had to learn, thrown into the deep end. A lamb to the slaughter one said on the night of my win. Within a few weeks I’d picked a fight with the Mayor and had started to understand just what local politics could be.\nMy first year and half was tough, it was trying to help residents whilst not being listened to in an opposition of 3 to 51 conservatives. I managed to achieve a few things, youngest group leader in the history of Bournemouth Council, standing against the Wessex field development, and funding seated garden area at Muscliff School which the kids, I’m reliably informed, love.\nI had my little scooter, Betsy, and if you had a problem, I’d be there in a flash, drinking your freshly made tea, tucking into a piece of battenburg, moaning with you about how things needed to change. Little did I know how much they would.\nBefore the full elections in May 2019, I really wasn’t sure I wanted to stand again, the first 18 months were tough, I’d enjoyed it in spells but it was depressing in opposition. But I felt a duty to my residents, and I’d managed to convince Lisa to stand with me. And it was the best decision I could have made, we smashed it, winning by a huge majority, I got the most votes in Bournemouth. And it was worth it just to see the smile on my mum’s face. From a 22 vote margin to a 1,022 vote margin was quite something.\nAnd for the next year and half it lead to me being able to do something I had set out to do when I first stood to be an MP. I became the Cabinet Member for Housing, and could have a direct influence on ending homelessness.\nOver my time on the cabinet I managed, with the support of my group and the Unity Alliance, to achieve so much.\nA huge reduction in rough sleeping with Housing First and a ‘health first’ approach that brought national recognition from MHCLG and a ministerial visit from the MP Luke Hall. The first social rented housing brought through in Bournemouth in over 20 years. Improved sustainability in our new builds to passive house standards which led to a letter from Dame Jane Goodall. The purchase of one of Europe’s largest brownfield sites, Holes Bay, to bring forward new affordable accommodation. And so much more, which I’m sure I’ve mentioned so many times you remember! But all of this lead to me being shortlisted for the country’s Young Councillor of the year.\nAnd then, under difficult circumstances, after the passing of two of our colleagues and more importantly our friends, and without the ability to have new elections during the pandemic we lost control of the council, and I lost my dream job.\nThe year since has been a struggle again, it’s so hard in opposition, you don’t have the same access to officers and information, or influence over decisions. I had to get a second job which as taken time and attention from my council work, thankfully they are a very understanding company. I’ve still been helping residents, answering emails, trying to solve issues. There was one case over the summer where housing officers misinterpreted the law, and my spotting their mistake allowed a number of vulnerable people to stay in their homes. The email of thanks from one resident made me well up. But it’s been hard.\nHowever, the thing I’m proudest of is the structures and cultures I put in place when in charge of Housing are still there. When I first arrived, there was no co-ordination in between the council and outside organisations, however when I left there was a homelessness reduction board and forum, with over 150 different stakeholders all pulling in the same direction to end homelessness. And there’s a specific group which helps those who have no access to public funding which has been so important. Everyone in should mean everyone.\nThere are small wins to be had as well, just yesterday at Health and Adult Social Care overview and scrutiny committee, I seconded a recommendation to ask cabinet members to write to our MPs asking for a review of the carer’s allowance which went up by just 35p a week in 2020, which passed.\nMy four years I’ve met some really interesting people, from the Governor of the Bank of England to those with lived experience of homelessness, each one I’ve learnt so much from, and I have made friends for life.\nSo far my time has been a rollercoaster, ups and downs, not just in the job, but personally after losing my mum, things haven’t been smooth, but it’s been such a privilege. To serve you, to work hard for you, to get things done for you and most importantly to make mistakes and to be forgiven by you.\nThankfully I don’t have to run for election for another year and a half but when they roll around in May 2023 I hope there are loads of good candidates standing, we need great people like you, yes you, running and winning, making the change this area needs. If I can do it, anyone can.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2024_12_21_cant-you-sleep-little-bear-2/content_2.html": "One of my earliest Christmases, I can’t remember which, Santa brought me a book called Can’t You Sleep, Little Bear? It was in a small themed gift bag and came with a Little Bear toy. I adored it; the book, the toy and the bag. So much so I kept it decades on. And I am actually looking at it as I write this now.\nThe plot as you can imagine is a simple one. It is a heartwarming story of Big Bear helping Little Bear, get to sleep. Despite his best efforts he can’t overcome his fear of the dark. So Big Bear takes it upon himself to relieve Little Bear of this anxiety. He does this by bringing him bigger and bigger lanterns, until eventually he takes him outside of their cave to show him how the moon – the biggest lantern of them all – is always there. And eventually Little Bear falls to sleep in Big Bear’s arms, in the comfort of their cave.\nIt’s message is about the connection of love between parents and children, as well as a child’s need for comfort, security and having their fears allayed. The story is always quite close to my heart, but it rose to the surface recently after the work we as a Council and Homelessness Partnership have done to significantly reduce our reliance on Bed and Breakfast (B&B) accommodation.\nB&B accommodation is the most challenging to live in; there often isn’t a suitable space for a child to do their homework or facilities for parents to cook decent meals. It really doesn’t have the conditions for a family to live and thrive as they should. It is a last resort and our dependence on it was costly to the welfare of the families living in it. I can imagine Little Bear not fully understanding why he’s in this strange place, without all his toys around him. And wondering why Big Bear is so worried?\nSo at the back end of last year we made a conscious decision, in agreement with the Homelessness Partnership, that we had to tackle this issue head on. We decided to acquire over 100 proper homes as a form of temporary accommodation. Somewhere that Big Bear can cook a Christmas dinner and put tree up for Little Bear.\nAlongside the acquisitions of homes we also put more focus on prevention. In doing this we had an increase of 30% in successfully keeping families in their home. And that is in a backdrop of a 13% increase in those coming to the council at risk of homelessness.\nWhat was the outcome of all this work? A 90% reduction in the course of a year in our use of B&B accommodation. Which is phenomenal, in a context where nationally we are seeing substantial rises in the use of B&B’s. At its peak not long after I took the role there were around 230 Children in B&B’s. Christmas Day last year we had 164 Children. Two days ago when we put out a press release we had 16. Today we have 14 Children in B&B, the number keeps dropping. And whilst it is still 14 too many, the reduction is such a source of pride for us. And I can only thank everyone that has made it happen. It is by no means the end of our work, in fact it is only the beginning. We will continue work tirelessly until everyone has a safe place that they can call home. But it is going in the right direction.\nIt has been a year with lots of change, but still many of the same challenges. Hopefully 2025 will bring us further reasons to be optimistic. If you’re reading this I hope you have the loveliest Christmas possible and the happiest of New Year’s. I have certainly got my present early this year knowing that 150 Little Bear’s will be sleeping slightly easier this Christmas Day.\nChristmas can be a difficult time for many people, and this can include concerns about the potential risk of homelessness.

  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_9/content_44.html": "The last seven weeks have aged me seven years but felt like seven minutes. I have learned so much in such a short space of time regarding housing; tenures to freeholds via CPOs. It has been a crazy period that has seen me open landlord conferences’ and begin dialogue with developers. But what I have really learned over the last two months is just how important a house is. It is more than bricks and mortar, windows and doors, carpets and curtains. It is our foundation, our stability, which we as people rely upon. It can be both the solution and cause of our problems. It’s where we argue and make up. It is where we burn our microwave meals before watching Corrie with a cuppa. It is where we spend most of our short existence. It is for these very reasons we must start looking at homes, and housing itself, differently.\nWhich is why one of the first things I have done as Housing Portfolio Holder is to put a blanket ban on the term ‘units’. Inspired by Channel 4’s resident architect George Clarke who I met at Housing 2019 (a conference held in Manchester last month). The logic behind it is, that it is a developer’s term, which is clinical and devoid of emotion. In fact when I first started I wasn’t exactly sure what a unit was or what it measured; beds, people, number of rooms? When we talk about ‘units’ we are talking about numbers, we are talking about the storage of people and their things inside of four very static walls. Rather than talking about their lives, exploring their needs and experiences, and the dynamic nature of home life. Whilst our housing targets set out by national government require use to maximise space, it doesn’t mean that we can’t build quality with these things in mind.\nThis is just one of the many ways in which we need to change our approach to housing, not just as a council but as a nation. There needs to a new approach to developments, built to create communities, where happiness not overheads are prioritised. Where we are thriving not surviving. There has to be a change of mentality around social renting too, the stigma needs to stop. I live in the same estate now as I always have done, and I am fully aware of the labels attached to council housing. The best way that we can influence this is by building more of it, and making it superior to that in the private rented sector. Much of which already is. In places like Vienna living in social rented housing is the norm, we need that here, especially as people of my age are now being labelled ‘generation rent’. Being part of that is fine. Buying a house is not for everyone, nor should it be, renting is brilliant. But the current levels of rent are not.\nSocial rent was a hot topic as I tried to get my Princess Road development through Cabinet and Full Council last week, why wasn’t there any? Which was more than a fair comment. Viability was the main answer, £5.1 million gap in funding. And the scheme does offer so many of the things that I believe are the answer to our housing problems. Mixed tenure, mixed communities, and 72% affordable housing capped at the Local Housing Allowance. It will be excellent housing, excellently managed. The local policy only requires 40% at this moment in time, and that is almost never met in Private Sector developments. Which is something else that certainly needs to change. On the whole Princess Road is a good scheme, but it is just the start, it is the baseline to measure all future developments of that size upon.\nIn that same Full Council we also declared a climate emergency, an ambitious target that will see the council carbon neutral by 2030. This is a huge challenge, but one we must rise too. Housing is no exception; we need to be building more sustainable homes. We have 3 exemplar passive homes in West Howe, which are not only eco-friendly but have an increased building life and saw resident’s utility bills reduced significantly. These are fantastic. But 3 is simply not enough, we must be building more.\nThen there is the utilisation of limited land and utilising the housing we already have. A huge part of this is starting with brownfield sites, which is I was more than happy to put forward a proposal to unlock funding to create a site acquisition strategy for the Holes Bay Power Station in Poole. The power station came down in 1993; I wasn’t born. For the subsequent 26 years it has been of no use. We must be looking to these brownfield sites first, by trying to work with the private sector. However if it has to brought back into public ownership, through a negotiated purchase or compulsory purchase order, then this gives us a great opportunity to create something that meets all of the requirements I’ve set out over the last 5 paragraphs. And whilst only giving it a single line we really do need to look at ways of bring empty homes back into use.\nSo as you have read, there is a lot going on. Some of it I have a direct impact on, a lot of it I don’t. We are at a crossroads in Housing both as a conurbation and as a country. And there are so many reasons to be optimistic about it; people in the industry are providing the solutions. Now it is time for Governments to wake up from the housing coma we’ve been in over the last 40 years. Ultimately I believe everyone deserves a home, not a unit, which they can feel comfortable in, which they can afford, be that rented or owned. A place to hang their hat and cook their beans on toast.\nThis small change in wording is a huge change in mentality going forward. For me ‘how many units?’ is the measure I use nowadays whilst in town on a Friday to tell me when it is time to go home.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2020_05_04_a-letter-to-myself-one-year-later/content_23.html": "4th May 2019\nKieron or should I say Cllr Wilson!\nI’m you 12 months from now and I’m writing to tell what the next year has in store.\nFirstly congrats! How is your head the day after winning the most votes in Bournemouth? Big and hurting if I remember rightly? Not as bad as your Dad’s or your Brother’s, but still bad eh? Well drink a pint of water, you’ve got work to do!\nThe first thing you are going to do is phone Lisa and check that yesterday wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t, perfect! Now you need to decide how what the plan is to work best for your residents.\nThe next couple of weeks you are going to see how the land lies, it’s been a dramatic result, and in your celebrations you haven’t quite realised what has just happened. You’ve got the opportunity to make a real change in the town you love. And everything seems so bright. You start conversations with the councillors you know. Simon Bull who was so fantastic with in your first year and half, and you’re going to form a group with him, Lisa and Chris, (who you don’t know so well yet, but you’ll love him despite the fact he supports Liverpool!) and you are going to form that group to protect the interests of Bournemouth. Suddenly by chance you are going to find yourself as the leader of this group going into negotiations with other groups to form the administration of the 12th largest council in the country. This is a big responsibility. Crazy I know. What’s crazier is the representative from Labour is going to say these meetings should start at 7am. So every morning for two weeks you are going to get up at six and get the bus to the town hall to sit in a room for hours and discuss shaping the future of this council.\nAnd these are surreal conversations, and you are going to fight your corner, be brave. There is no reason not to say how you feel, you owe nothing to anyone except those who voted for you and your group. These are strangers, who will become friends, but for now get everything off your chest. There is no room for formalities when you are speaking about what you believe in. And when you do you will realise that you have much more in common with the people in this room then you first thought and you will see their passion for these three towns. And as they decide on cabinet positions you are going to make the pitch of your life for Housing, because you got into politics to make sure everyone has a place they can call home.\nDon’t worry, your passion for the role will convince them. Incredibly you, yes you, are going to be the Cabinet Member for Housing. Finally you will be in a position to change things, though I need to warn you it won’t happen as quickly as you want or thought. But be patient, you are making a difference.\nThe first couple of months your head is going to be so filled with so much information that you won’t even be able to process it all initially. Take a lot of notes, but then read them, don’t just leave them like I know you will! Next you’ll travel, you know where best practice is, so go, write a letter to the y-foundation in Finland and tell them you are going there to learn about housing first. You’ll absolutely love it. Also the homeless World Cup is in Cardiff check it out!\nYou’ll spend the summer working, getting a grip on your portfolio, asking questions, having tours of the housing stock (there’s so much) meeting so many officers and organisations you’ll lose count. You’ll put forward plans to potentially purchase Holes Bay. You’ll start pushing your development team for social housing. You are going to be scrutinised, at times harshly, sometimes about your age, always about your ability. You’ll doubt yourself. You shouldn’t, you’re capable, and if you are doubting, remember that more people in Bournemouth voted for you than anyone else. You are going to work as hard as possible, to the point that you eat, sleep and breath it, you know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nBut take some time out to each day and week. Watch Home and Away, Neighbours and Doctors back to back with Mum, and really cherish that time. Please, enjoy those moments with her, don’t take them for granted. Tell her you love her, she knows, but please reminder her more often than you do.\nAnd suddenly you’re cooking with gas. Summer is fading but you’re excited, you’re starting to make decisions, you’re putting your stamp on your portfolio. Giving presentations to officers on your trip to Finland, influencing bids for rough sleeper grants, creating policies and helping those who the system has failed. You get much better at scrutiny as well you knock back the questions with comparative ease to when you first started. You’re going to be on a panel speaking at a Key Cities event about housing. For the first time since you’ve got role you are going to feel completely assured. Chest puffed out, head high.\nAnd this is where you are going to get your first bump in the road.\nDecember comes, a month you usually love, your birthday, Christmas. But this is going to be the worst month of your life and I doubt it will be beaten if you live for another 100 years. It’ll start on your birthday, you’ll accidentally see the girl you’ve been seeing with another boy and you’re little heart will ache. This will start a spiral of very unfortunate events. Mum’s condition will get worse, you’ll be woken up each morning at 4 as she struggles to climb the stairs. You’ll go to the General Election count, see the conservatives win a landslide, get drunk and do things you wish you hadn’t. Then on Boxing Day the doctor will tell you your mum has hours to live. You’ll spend 20 hours by her side waiting for her to pass. And in the last moments of her life, as her face changes, the pain you feel will be truly unbearable. And I won’t pretend to you it gets easier even as I write this I still replay it.\nSo many people loved mum, you’re going to get so much support from all over the world as well as here. Xavi, Carlos and Eli are going to come from Barcelona less than 48 hours later to make sure you are ok. Messages are going to flood in. You’ll feel loved. And you will need the love of hundreds of people to fill the gap she left. You’ll focus, push the pain aside momentarily and organise a beautiful send off with Dad and Cal. You won’t believe how many turn up. You’ll be overwhelmed.\nThen it gets hard, you’ll throw yourself back into work. You’ll be in meetings but you won’t really be there. For a few anyways. Eventually things will start to go back to some sort of normal. The grief will hang there, and you’ll bring it up when you’re alone. But while you’re not you’ll smile, even laugh when people ask you how you are. It’s not because that’s how you feel it’s because you really don’t know what to say. You’re going to go to a very dark place. But less than a month after the funeral you are going to drag yourself to be scrutinised in public once again. And although it won’t be your best performance, the fact that you did it will be such a huge achievement, looking back I have no idea how you do.\nSo then just as you start to get back in the swing, covid -19 hits! A global pandemic killing 28,000 people in the U.K. to date. I’m being serious. Honestly, it’s something we haven’t seen for a century. And you’re going to spend weeks in lockdown, in your house to save lives, and it is so important you respect that. It’ll be hard, and it’ll make you think so much about mum. The good news is you though you get a puppy just before, make sure you call him Nero, and working from home is quite nice. Your officers are incredible, they mobilise so quickly. During the crisis you and your team find accommodation for every rough sleeper.\nIt’s a scary time. But you have the support of the Unity Alliance, those people you don’t know yet but they are brilliant. Trust me. The future looks uncertain but really that is for me to deal with, not you. You just have to remember how lucky you are to do a job you enjoy, representing the area you were born and to have had a mum as beautiful as you did. I’ll write again in a year, hopefully things will be on the up. Oh yeah, and always look on the bright side (you’ll understand eventually).\nLove Kieron\nP.S. you also get a selfie (picture attached) with the Governor of the Bank of England who you originally thought was Keith from Sunderland. Long story, but again you’ll laugh hard when it happens.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_17/content_71.html": "It’s March, it’s snowing, and the cold has reached parts of my body I forgotten I even had. I am stood in the middle of a nearly empty high street, shivering, and thinking to myself ‘how did I get myself into this one then?’\nI had decided to take on the challenge of trying to sell The Big Issue. I wanted to get a perspective of what it was like to do so; I wanted to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes as it were. Feeling confident I purchased 10 copies for £12.50 and as it was my first time I received 5 extra for free. My confidence was heavily misplaced; I only managed to sell 2. Most people walked by without noticing me, when I offered the magazine I was ignored, and one woman questioned why I was doing it. ‘You don’t look homeless, why are you selling these?’ I tried to explain that I was a master’s student, and a Bournemouth Borough Councilor, and reassured her any money I made would be going to the mental health charity Dorset Mind. She looked at me as though I was from another universe, far removed from hers, before walking off. I probably should have told her it wasn’t necessary to be homeless to sell The Big Issue, you just have to be in need of a helping hand.\nAfter that I was so grateful when people acknowledged me, and the few that gave me money nearly brought me to tears. There is a stigma about homelessness, rough sleeping, and vulnerability. I experienced it first hand. Rough Sleeping in the UK and, most relevantly, Bournemouth is becoming far too big a problem to ignore.\nThe whole of Europe is facing a rise of homelessness and rough sleeping, with the exception of Finland . Finland flipped the script on homelessness. Instead of trying to deal with the social and health problems, they got those who are homeless straight into a house. Since 2008 Finland have had a strategy in place to deal with those on the streets. ‘Investments have been made to provide affordable housing and shelters have been converted into supported housing units. New services and methods of help have been developed to match the multiple needs of individual tenants.’\nThe aim has been to look at long-term solutions rather than quick fixes. Of course when you put someone in a home their problems don’t just disappear, but you give them a solid foundation on which to build. Becoming homeless can happen to just about anyone, in this economy, a sudden job loss or bereavement, you could find yourself on the streets. In Finland they have come to realize that the problems you face are much easier solved when you have a home. Being in a home allows those who need it constant support; appointments with doctors and social workers are harder missed when you have a fixed abode.\nThe Y-Foundation whose goal is to end homelessness in Finland, intend to do so providing affordable rental housing. In 2016 the foundation had 6,675 apartments operating in 52 towns and cities across Finland . The chief executive of the Y-Foundation, Juha Kaakinen, believes that money is not the reason other countries are not following Finland’s initiative. ‘To say that the scarcity of funding in any western European country is the reason for lack of affordable social housing is either an understatement or a conscious misunderstanding. It is simply a question of political will.’\nIn this country there just doesn’t seem to be that same political will that Juha talked about. But there should be. And here’s why; it is more cost effective to put some in a home straight away, rather then leave them on the streets. If we can’t appeal to the humanistic side of Theresa May, then let us appeal to the economical side. It saves money in the long run.

How is your head the day after winning the most votes in Bournemouth? Big and hurting if I remember rightly? Not as bad as your Dad’s or your Brother’s, but still bad eh? Well drink a pint of water, you’ve got work to do!\nThe first thing you are going to do is phone Lisa and check that yesterday wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t, perfect! Now you need to decide how what the plan is to work best for your residents.\nThe next couple of weeks you are going to see how the land lies, it’s been a dramatic result, and in your celebrations you haven’t quite realised what has just happened. You’ve got the opportunity to make a real change in the town you love. And everything seems so bright. You start conversations with the councillors you know. Simon Bull who was so fantastic with in your first year and half, and you’re going to form a group with him, Lisa and Chris, (who you don’t know so well yet, but you’ll love him despite the fact he supports Liverpool!) and you are going to form that group to protect the interests of Bournemouth. Suddenly by chance you are going to find yourself as the leader of this group going into negotiations with other groups to form the administration of the 12th largest council in the country. This is a big responsibility. Crazy I know. What’s crazier is the representative from Labour is going to say these meetings should start at 7am. So every morning for two weeks you are going to get up at six and get the bus to the town hall to sit in a room for hours and discuss shaping the future of this council.\nAnd these are surreal conversations, and you are going to fight your corner, be brave. There is no reason not to say how you feel, you owe nothing to anyone except those who voted for you and your group. These are strangers, who will become friends, but for now get everything off your chest. There is no room for formalities when you are speaking about what you believe in. And when you do you will realise that you have much more in common with the people in this room then you first thought and you will see their passion for these three towns. And as they decide on cabinet positions you are going to make the pitch of your life for Housing, because you got into politics to make sure everyone has a place they can call home.\nDon’t worry, your passion for the role will convince them. Incredibly you, yes you, are going to be the Cabinet Member for Housing. Finally you will be in a position to change things, though I need to warn you it won’t happen as quickly as you want or thought. But be patient, you are making a difference.\nThe first couple of months your head is going to be so filled with so much information that you won’t even be able to process it all initially. Take a lot of notes, but then read them, don’t just leave them like I know you will! Next you’ll travel, you know where best practice is, so go, write a letter to the y-foundation in Finland and tell them you are going there to learn about housing first. You’ll absolutely love it. Also the homeless World Cup is in Cardiff check it out!\nYou’ll spend the summer working, getting a grip on your portfolio, asking questions, having tours of the housing stock (there’s so much) meeting so many officers and organisations you’ll lose count. You’ll put forward plans to potentially purchase Holes Bay. You’ll start pushing your development team for social housing. You are going to be scrutinised, at times harshly, sometimes about your age, always about your ability. You’ll doubt yourself. You shouldn’t, you’re capable, and if you are doubting, remember that more people in Bournemouth voted for you than anyone else. You are going to work as hard as possible, to the point that you eat, sleep and breath it, you know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nBut take some time out to each day and week. Watch Home and Away, Neighbours and Doctors back to back with Mum, and really cherish that time. Please, enjoy those moments with her, don’t take them for granted. Tell her you love her, she knows, but please reminder her more often than you do.\nAnd suddenly you’re cooking with gas. Summer is fading but you’re excited, you’re starting to make decisions, you’re putting your stamp on your portfolio. Giving presentations to officers on your trip to Finland, influencing bids for rough sleeper grants, creating policies and helping those who the system has failed. You get much better at scrutiny as well you knock back the questions with comparative ease to when you first started. You’re going to be on a panel speaking at a Key Cities event about housing. For the first time since you’ve got role you are going to feel completely assured. Chest puffed out, head high.\nAnd this is where you are going to get your first bump in the road.\nDecember comes, a month you usually love, your birthday, Christmas. But this is going to be the worst month of your life and I doubt it will be beaten if you live for another 100 years. It’ll start on your birthday, you’ll accidentally see the girl you’ve been seeing with another boy and you’re little heart will ache. This will start a spiral of very unfortunate events. Mum’s condition will get worse, you’ll be woken up each morning at 4 as she struggles to climb the stairs. You’ll go to the General Election count, see the conservatives win a landslide, get drunk and do things you wish you hadn’t. Then on Boxing Day the doctor will tell you your mum has hours to live. You’ll spend 20 hours by her side waiting for her to pass. And in the last moments of her life, as her face changes, the pain you feel will be truly unbearable. And I won’t pretend to you it gets easier even as I write this I still replay it.\nSo many people loved mum, you’re going to get so much support from all over the world as well as here. Xavi, Carlos and Eli are going to come from Barcelona less than 48 hours later to make sure you are ok. Messages are going to flood in. You’ll feel loved. And you will need the love of hundreds of people to fill the gap she left. You’ll focus, push the pain aside momentarily and organise a beautiful send off with Dad and Cal. You won’t believe how many turn up. You’ll be overwhelmed.\nThen it gets hard, you’ll throw yourself back into work. You’ll be in meetings but you won’t really be there. For a few anyways. Eventually things will start to go back to some sort of normal. The grief will hang there, and you’ll bring it up when you’re alone. But while you’re not you’ll smile, even laugh when people ask you how you are. It’s not because that’s how you feel it’s because you really don’t know what to say. You’re going to go to a very dark place. But less than a month after the funeral you are going to drag yourself to be scrutinised in public once again. And although it won’t be your best performance, the fact that you did it will be such a huge achievement, looking back I have no idea how you do.\nSo then just as you start to get back in the swing, covid -19 hits! A global pandemic killing 28,000 people in the U.K. to date. I’m being serious. Honestly, it’s something we haven’t seen for a century. And you’re going to spend weeks in lockdown, in your house to save lives, and it is so important you respect that. It’ll be hard, and it’ll make you think so much about mum. The good news is you though you get a puppy just before, make sure you call him Nero, and working from home is quite nice. Your officers are incredible, they mobilise so quickly. During the crisis you and your team find accommodation for every rough sleeper.\nIt’s a scary time. But you have the support of the Unity Alliance, those people you don’t know yet but they are brilliant. Trust me. The future looks uncertain but really that is for me to deal with, not you. You just have to remember how lucky you are to do a job you enjoy, representing the area you were born and to have had a mum as beautiful as you did. I’ll write again in a year, hopefully things will be on the up. Oh yeah, and always look on the bright side (you’ll understand eventually).\nLove Kieron\nP.S. you also get a selfie (picture attached) with the Governor of the Bank of England who you originally thought was Keith from Sunderland. Long story, but again you’ll laugh hard when it happens.",

  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_16/content_70.html": "It’s March, it’s snowing, and the cold has reached parts of my body I forgotten I even had. I am stood in the middle of a nearly empty high street, shivering, and thinking to myself ‘how did I get myself into this one then?’\nI had decided to take on the challenge of trying to sell The Big Issue. I wanted to get a perspective of what it was like to do so; I wanted to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes as it were. Feeling confident I purchased 10 copies for £12.50 and as it was my first time I received 5 extra for free. My confidence was heavily misplaced; I only managed to sell 2. Most people walked by without noticing me, when I offered the magazine I was ignored, and one woman questioned why I was doing it. ‘You don’t look homeless, why are you selling these?’ I tried to explain that I was a master’s student, and a Bournemouth Borough Councilor, and reassured her any money I made would be going to the mental health charity Dorset Mind. She looked at me as though I was from another universe, far removed from hers, before walking off. I probably should have told her it wasn’t necessary to be homeless to sell The Big Issue, you just have to be in need of a helping hand.\nAfter that I was so grateful when people acknowledged me, and the few that gave me money nearly brought me to tears. There is a stigma about homelessness, rough sleeping, and vulnerability. I experienced it first hand. Rough Sleeping in the UK and, most relevantly, Bournemouth is becoming far too big a problem to ignore.\nThe whole of Europe is facing a rise of homelessness and rough sleeping, with the exception of Finland . Finland flipped the script on homelessness. Instead of trying to deal with the social and health problems, they got those who are homeless straight into a house. Since 2008 Finland have had a strategy in place to deal with those on the streets. ‘Investments have been made to provide affordable housing and shelters have been converted into supported housing units. New services and methods of help have been developed to match the multiple needs of individual tenants.’\nThe aim has been to look at long-term solutions rather than quick fixes. Of course when you put someone in a home their problems don’t just disappear, but you give them a solid foundation on which to build. Becoming homeless can happen to just about anyone, in this economy, a sudden job loss or bereavement, you could find yourself on the streets. In Finland they have come to realize that the problems you face are much easier solved when you have a home. Being in a home allows those who need it constant support; appointments with doctors and social workers are harder missed when you have a fixed abode.\nThe Y-Foundation whose goal is to end homelessness in Finland, intend to do so providing affordable rental housing. In 2016 the foundation had 6,675 apartments operating in 52 towns and cities across Finland . The chief executive of the Y-Foundation, Juha Kaakinen, believes that money is not the reason other countries are not following Finland’s initiative. ‘To say that the scarcity of funding in any western European country is the reason for lack of affordable social housing is either an understatement or a conscious misunderstanding. It is simply a question of political will.’\nIn this country there just doesn’t seem to be that same political will that Juha talked about. But there should be. And here’s why; it is more cost effective to put some in a home straight away, rather then leave them on the streets. If we can’t appeal to the humanistic side of Theresa May, then let us appeal to the economical side. It saves money in the long run. In Finland ‘the savings in terms of the services needed by one person can be up to 9,600 euros a year when compared to the costs that would result from that person being homeless.’\nI can already hear the sceptics saying; ‘but we don’t live in Finland, and it couldn’t work here in the UK.’\nWell actually it could, in 2017 the charity Crisis underwent a pilot scheme in the city region of Liverpool to see if it could, and the results were promising. They found that ‘a policy of this kind could be five times more effective and nearly five times more cost effective than existing services.’ The cost of homeless in the UK is more than 1 billion per year according to the government’s spending watchdog . That figure is only going to rise if we don’t address the problem, and in Housing First we seem to have a solution that can go a long way to doing so.\nThis doesn’t mean a home fixes everything. Not at all, the study by Crisis found that along with a house, ‘support to help people exit homelessness should include: emotional support, peer support, independence, not being judged, opportunities for rehabilitation and longer term planning, structure and purpose’.\nMost of these can be covered by the work The Big Issue provides; they have a great team here in Bournemouth.

  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_13/content_64.html": "A year ago today 533 of you lovely people voted for me to become your representative on Bournemouth Borough Council. I remember that day with such clarity, the weather was fairly grim, it was cold, because of which I certainly hadn’t anticipated so many of you going to the polls to vote for me. I spent the first part of the morning delivering my last few letters with my Dad, then in the afternoon, I went back home to play FIFA 18 to calm both my excitement and my nerves for the evening ahead. When I arrived at the Town Hall for the results I was greeted by a council officer who thought I was a counting agent not a candidate. But after the counting began it was clear that I was not only a candidate but a contender. It is an incredibly surreal feeling seeing ballot paper after ballot paper with a cross by your name. When it had become clear that I had won, by a margin of 22 votes, or a football match as I like to think of it, the pride I felt was inexplicable.\nA year on I still have that extreme sense of pride, and I still haven’t got used to people calling me Councillor, I probably never will. But one thing have started to get used to in this past year is the way that local government operates, and I have begun to understand its flaws, of which there are many. Firstly there is procedures and archaic ceremonies which put you instantly on the back foot as young candidate, whether designed to intimidate or not they certainly have that effect, there are so many points of order that you spend as much time worrying about getting those right then you do the matter at hand. But these are nothing compared to the way the council actually conducts business with in the chamber at Full Council meetings, Cabinet decisions are passed with no effort at all. Councillors will often describe consensus on motions such as ‘We should be reducing plastic usage in the council’ as a debate. It is not a debate Councillor if everyone agrees it is a good idea and that it should have been implemented years ago.\nThen there are the staged questions that councillors, who are obviously conservative because there aren’t really any others, par take in. The ‘Can someone one tell me what we are doing about this very minor issue?’ questions. To which a portfolio holder replies ‘Oh it’s funny you should ask that question we just did something to look good about it yesterday and I have this answer that will not only allow me to show off, get in the echo, but also allow me a few digs at Labour, Lib Dems or any other party who dare question us’. I so often get disillusioned with the Full Council meetings. Pre-arranged questions with pre-arranged answers, never written by the councillors themselves but the hard working officers.\nThere is no debate, no dialogue, no authenticity in the council, and especially among the councillors themselves. Don’t get me wrong, there are a number of hardworking, honest councillors who despite their ideological persuasions I would be happy to see elected again, however there isn’t nearly as many as there should be. However in May we have the chance to change things, not only the council’s composition in terms of which party they represent, but with the merging of Christchurch, Poole and Bournemouth Councils we have the chance to change the way it operates. That is such an exciting prospect. But things won’t change if we keep voting conservative as a town. Einstein, whom I am led to believe was quite intelligent, said ‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.’ There needs to be more accountability in our local government, whilst conservatives have had it too easy for too long. What they want happens, and who is it benefiting, rough sleeping and homelessness have increased so much over the last ten years in Bournemouth whilst they have been in Government locally. They argue they are doing the best they can with their hands financially tied from national government, yet they wear the name and emblem of those keeping them captive, it’s Stockholm syndrome at its worse.\nHomelessness is the very visible failure of the conservative government both nationally and locally, but on top of that you have the paradoxical stance of wanting to protect greenbelt land at all costs with willing building on greenbelt land if there’s no cost. At the end of this month it’s almost certain that the A338 Wessex Fields scheme will be granted permission, despite its obvious flaws, because there is a huge grant coming from central government that can only be spent on that.\nI want to end this on a brighter note by saying thank you to those who voted for me a year ago today. It was a special night, and one that reflecting on will always bring a smile to my face. In the subsequent year I have given it my all to represent you, I know there’s more I could have done, and I know there is much more still to do. As we head towards May 2nd I would obviously love you to vote for me again, and for Lisa for the first time, but I really urge everyone in Bournemouth to think about who they are voting for. It’s time to end the insanity.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2022_01_18_my-first-term/content_9.html": "Today marks my fourth year as a councillor, which is the typical length of a term for someone in my position. It’s as long as Donald Trump got in the White House and a year longer than Theresa May got as Prime Minister. And so to mark the occasion I wanted to reflect, and write a long overdue piece for my blog.\nI won my first election by 22 votes, or as I like to think of it, a football match. Wearing an horrendous donkey jacket and a green knitted fleece which couldn’t have looked worse if I tried (evidence supplied below), I became the youngest member of the council. And straight away I had to learn, thrown into the deep end. A lamb to the slaughter one said on the night of my win. Within a few weeks I’d picked a fight with the Mayor and had started to understand just what local politics could be.\nMy first year and half was tough, it was trying to help residents whilst not being listened to in an opposition of 3 to 51 conservatives. I managed to achieve a few things, youngest group leader in the history of Bournemouth Council, standing against the Wessex field development, and funding seated garden area at Muscliff School which the kids, I’m reliably informed, love.\nI had my little scooter, Betsy, and if you had a problem, I’d be there in a flash, drinking your freshly made tea, tucking into a piece of battenburg, moaning with you about how things needed to change. Little did I know how much they would.\nBefore the full elections in May 2019, I really wasn’t sure I wanted to stand again, the first 18 months were tough, I’d enjoyed it in spells but it was depressing in opposition. But I felt a duty to my residents, and I’d managed to convince Lisa to stand with me. And it was the best decision I could have made, we smashed it, winning by a huge majority, I got the most votes in Bournemouth. And it was worth it just to see the smile on my mum’s face. From a 22 vote margin to a 1,022 vote margin was quite something.\nAnd for the next year and half it lead to me being able to do something I had set out to do when I first stood to be an MP. I became the Cabinet Member for Housing, and could have a direct influence on ending homelessness.\nOver my time on the cabinet I managed, with the support of my group and the Unity Alliance, to achieve so much.\nA huge reduction in rough sleeping with Housing First and a ‘health first’ approach that brought national recognition from MHCLG and a ministerial visit from the MP Luke Hall. The first social rented housing brought through in Bournemouth in over 20 years. Improved sustainability in our new builds to passive house standards which led to a letter from Dame Jane Goodall. The purchase of one of Europe’s largest brownfield sites, Holes Bay, to bring forward new affordable accommodation. And so much more, which I’m sure I’ve mentioned so many times you remember! But all of this lead to me being shortlisted for the country’s Young Councillor of the year.\nAnd then, under difficult circumstances, after the passing of two of our colleagues and more importantly our friends, and without the ability to have new elections during the pandemic we lost control of the council, and I lost my dream job.\nThe year since has been a struggle again, it’s so hard in opposition, you don’t have the same access to officers and information, or influence over decisions. I had to get a second job which as taken time and attention from my council work, thankfully they are a very understanding company. I’ve still been helping residents, answering emails, trying to solve issues. There was one case over the summer where housing officers misinterpreted the law, and my spotting their mistake allowed a number of vulnerable people to stay in their homes. The email of thanks from one resident made me well up. But it’s been hard.\nHowever, the thing I’m proudest of is the structures and cultures I put in place when in charge of Housing are still there. When I first arrived, there was no co-ordination in between the council and outside organisations, however when I left there was a homelessness reduction board and forum, with over 150 different stakeholders all pulling in the same direction to end homelessness. And there’s a specific group which helps those who have no access to public funding which has been so important. Everyone in should mean everyone.\nThere are small wins to be had as well, just yesterday at Health and Adult Social Care overview and scrutiny committee, I seconded a recommendation to ask cabinet members to write to our MPs asking for a review of the carer’s allowance which went up by just 35p a week in 2020, which passed.\nMy four years I’ve met some really interesting people, from the Governor of the Bank of England to those with lived experience of homelessness, each one I’ve learnt so much from, and I have made friends for life.\nSo far my time has been a rollercoaster, ups and downs, not just in the job, but personally after losing my mum, things haven’t been smooth, but it’s been such a privilege. To serve you, to work hard for you, to get things done for you and most importantly to make mistakes and to be forgiven by you.\nThankfully I don’t have to run for election for another year and a half but when they roll around in May 2023 I hope there are loads of good candidates standing, we need great people like you, yes you, running and winning, making the change this area needs. If I can do it, anyone can.",

This a new blog from Kieron Wilson Independent Councillor for Throop and Muscliff, giving you an insight into what is happening at your council, as well as addressing the issues that matter in Bournemouth.\nGood company in a journey makes the way seem shorter. — Izaak Walton",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_12/content_35.html": "In the time I’ve been a councillor the biggest issue that has faced me is what should be done with Hicks Farm. There is a general consensus that something needs to be done. The condition that the council have allowed it deteriorate to over the years is unacceptable, and the number of emails I received in my first few months about its condition reinforced that fact. So when the council brought forward their idea about turning it into a community space I approached it, as I approach everything, with an open mind, understanding that Hicks Farm can’t stay in the state it is in.\nHowever the process that it has undertaken in the last 8 months or so hasn’t been the process that should take place when discussing a community space. Firstly the public consultation only spent three days in Throop itself, whilst the rest of the month it was at the Kingfisher Barn. Which whist I acknowledge there is logistical difficulty in having more time in Throop, you can’t spend so little time in the place where the project will be located. Whilst during the consultation period, the opinions and concerns of residents were belittled and mocked by fellow ward councillors as ‘NIMBYs’ which I found distasteful and not what you should expect from those who are said to represent you. The concerns are valid ones, does Throop have the infrastructure for a community space on a scale that will make the project worthwhile for the council? Will it potentially bring a rise in anti-social behaviour? How many cars are going to be parked in an already congested part of the ward? These are just some of the fair questions and concerns that have been raised by my constituents, and it is our jobs as councillors to address these concerns not deride them.\nHowever this pattern of behaviour is not unusual from my fellow ward councillors, Cllr Clark and the Mayor Borthwick, whom not so long ago mistakenly sent an email to a resident in which they were colluding to keep information away from me. Whilst I understand that for them it is just politics being played out, it is you that has suffered. But that doesn’t matter very much to them. Through this whole process I have been kept in the dark. To my astonishment last week at what could be my last area forum, Cllr Clark revealed that Throop Mill had been sold and was under new ownership. This was a fresh information to me, and I have since sent a number of emails to Cllr Clark asking for the details of the acquisition and the new owner. Still waiting on a reply.\nThen yesterday I learnt of an eviction notice being served to tenants of Hicks Farm, not from a phone call from a councillor, or an email from an officer, but from the post of a very active group in my ward, the Throop Village Conservation Group. This group have been important in enhancing your democracy, whilst I have not agreed with very single post they have written, I have appreciated their tenacity and commitment to a cause they feel strongly about. Unfortunately for me they have been far too often where I hear news first. Despite my constant insistence to be updated, and the number of emails I send out on a regular basis asking what the state of play is on number of issues, I am too often kept in the dark on purpose. Which is why you deserve better councillors.\nI include myself in that, I need to improve, I’ve been doing it a year now, I know a lot but I still have so much more to learn. Which is why in two months on May 2nd, if you are going to vote for me, you have to vote for Lisa Northover as well. Her experience will be invaluable to both me and you, her compassion and intelligence will be an asset to the ward and the town. But it is her honesty and integrity that will be the most valuable qualities, both of which are considerably lacking in my colleges. She is of the same opinion as myself with regards to Hicks Farm. That something needs to be done with it, but it has to be done within keeping of the scale and tradition of Throop Village. If an application goes to planning board that we are not happy with we will fight against it with everything we have.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2019_05_22_a-lamb-to-the-slaughter/content_32.html": "A year and a half ago when I won my by-election I was in earshot of a conservative Councillor stating ‘He’ll be a lamb to the slaughter’ I’ve never forgotten it and I never will. Since then I’ve held the Tories to account, won another election gaining the most votes in Bournemouth, and last night I became the portfolio holder for Housing and Deputy Leader of an administration that kicked the tories out of power. If this is how lambs get slaughtered I no longer need to be a vegetarian.\nWhat was achieved over the last few weeks was no small feat. People will probably never understand just how hard it was. Bringing together five different groups, from all backgrounds, ages and politics, to work together was never going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is right? The 7:00 am meetings, the sleeplessness nights, and seemingly endless talks, at times were a struggle. But this Unity Alliance has so much more uniting us than dividing us. We are all centred around the common goal of leaving the conurbation in a much better state than we left it, we care about the environment, we want transparency, openness and inclusiveness. Not just amongst councillors, but with you as residents. We work for you, people before politics, partnership over partisanship. Be under no illusions though the next four years are going to be tough. The tories will jump on any mistake, and exaggerate it no end. They’ll scrutinise, as they should, and it will be our job to make sure we are up to that scrutiny.\nThis is an opportunity of a lifetime, one that I never thought would come along. Exactly two years ago I was running in the General Election, my main pledge was to try and find a solution to ending homelessness and rough sleeping within Bournemouth. I didn’t feel there was a political will to do so. Now I’m in a position to do that. I can’t quite believe it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have all the answers, but there is certainly no one in this town who is more committed to find those answers than me.\nIt would be so wrong of me to sit here and pretend that this is my victory, it’s not, it’s yours. I am nothing without your support and of course your votes. And I haven’t had a chance to thank everyone who voted for myself and Lisa. We worked so hard during the campaign and you guys recognised that. You voted for change and you’ve got it. You’re no longer shouting into the wind, instead you are in power alongside us. And it’s genuinely exciting. The next four years aren’t going to be a stroll in the park, but we are setting out with the very best of intentions and that’s more than can be said about previous administrations.\nI want wrap up this post by thanking Vikki (she’s going to be a fantastic leader), Mark, Margret, Fizz, George, Stephen and all of those that went into talks a week ago with an open mind, willing to listen and compromise when needed. I want to thank Simon, Chris and Lisa for putting their faith in me as the Group Leader of the Bournemouth Group, to fight for the interests of their residents and of Bournemouth itself. We can’t say for certain what the next four years will bring, but I can say that I’ve never been more excited for the future of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch.",

With over 700 homeless people dying in the UK in the last year, lives are literally at stake and a crisis response is overdue.\nFor some who previously held a role similar to mine, statements like this would be treated as something that needed to be contested and disputed. Worried about hurting the image of the party or individual. But I welcome this statement, because it is true. We are in a housing crisis; lives are at stake and it does need urgent attention. And even more so I welcome passionate people within the area challenging what we as an Alliance are doing about the current situation. I consider them angels on my shoulder rather than thorns in my side.\nLater today I am presenting a report on the Homelessness and Rough Sleeping Action Plan to the Overview and Scrutiny Board. An interim document before we begin work on a more comprehensive Homelessness Strategy which we have until the 31st March 2021 to complete. However, I would like to see that come forward before 2021 and to be worked alongside the Housing Strategy which should be complete by the end of 2020. During the period as work begins this Action Plan will hopefully ‘implement measures to tackle the unfolding situation’ building on much of the good work we are already doing.\nThe Action plan is summarised through 6 key objectives:\n1) Preventing homelessness and minimising the use of temporary accommodation\n2) Reducing homelessness and rough sleeping to as close to zero as possible (and that should always be our goal, ending it)\n3) Developing a range of suitable housing options and pathways\n4) Improving partnership work and wider communications to ensure an effective use of resources\n5) Improve health, wellbeing and awareness\n6) Update policies, process and protocols after becoming BCP council.\nUnder each of these objectives there is a number of priorities we are pursuing in order to achieve them and I could go through them all in this blog piece, but I’d be concerned about losing your attention.\nSo I want to focus on an objective that I feel the council have failed to live up to its potential in for a number of years now. Which is objective number 4, improving partnership work and wider communications to ensure an effective use of resource. There is so much drive from so many agencies within the conurbation to reduce and end homelessness in its entirety, however for as long as I can remember they haven’t quite been on the same wavelength on how to do it. That is why at the start of my tenure I felt it was vital to get everyone in the same room, fortunately for me, my officers had the same idea, and on October 10th, World Homelessness Day, we launched a new BCP Homelessness Partnership. The partnership will hopefully act as the ‘multi-agency task force’ that the resident requested in their statement to full council. The idea behind it is bringing together local voluntary and statutory organisations, as well as the business community, to join up efforts and tie together projects. So that we can avoid duplication and ensure that there is a common targeted approach to addressing homelessness. The will is certainly there but we all need to be on the same page going forward. This new partnership will include a governance board and a number of focused sub-groups, which will narrow their attention on specific elements, one example being a Meaningful Occupation group, all based around getting those coming off the street, or homeless, back into work, and we have had a lot a positive interest around this. The partnership will co-produce the Homelessness strategy, and at the centre of the partnership will be the Homelessness Reduction Board. The board will agree the strategic direction and vision to prevent homelessness and tackle rough sleeping, which is vital, particularly where these issues require an integrated response between organisations, and it is about creating a framework which we are accountable to if we are not doing as well as we should be.\nJust last week I gave officers a presentation on Housing First and what I had learned in Finland. At the heart of why Finland have been so successful is the ability to work in partnership for the common good. There are so many organisations working well together, communicating, and the lead comes from the local and national government. And I really hope that the next government in this country understands the scale of the task they have ahead of them, whoever it is come the 12th December. Because the previous governments haven’t, when the financial crisis hit in 2008, cuts were made in Finland, but housing was invested in and that for me is the reason they are currently ranked as the happiest country in the world. Because without sounding like a broken record; if you have a decent home everything else starts to fall into place. Being holistic in our approach is also vital, every aspect for a person’s life can potentially make them homeless, from a job loss, to a broken-down relationship, or a rogue landlord. That is why I am doing a number of things outside of this Action Plan such as bringing forward Discretionary Licencing to go to public consultation (which will be a blog of its own in a couple of months) and am looking forward to working with a cross section of organisations in health and children’s services on the housing and homelessness strategies.\nAt the launch back of the partnership in October there was a tension, and I think that is quite natural, in fact I would be surprised if there wasn’t. For a few that was caused by a feeling of ‘we’ve been here before with the council’, for others it was caused by the contrasting interests of other groups. But regardless of those tensions, everyone that was in the room brought a great dynamism to the debate, all representing organisations that have improved people’s lives already, and within the room were all the answers we need to end homelessness. But ending homelessness will not happen overnight, it almost definitely will not happen in my time as portfolio holder, but what I do what we do in the next four years can lay down solid foundations on which future administrations can build upon.\nSo I want to thank the kind person for the statement, it is not only welcomed but appreciated, keep them coming in, only when you stop will I know my our work is done.",

Since my last a lot of bad things have happened, by far the worst of which was my mum, whom many of you reading this will know, passed away. She was my best friend, my angel. She wasn’t really into politics, except when I was running. She didn’t care particularly for the left or right, she only knew to be kind. That is what I’ve always tried to do, though my success rate has never been as high as her’s.\nThe last two months have been a battle, I haven’t taken any leave because I was really not sure I would be able to start again if I stopped. And actually continuing to work has really helped. The support of fellow councillors has been so good, and I am enterally grateful to the members of my group, the cabinet, officers and the whole of the Unity Alliance, along with a number of conservatives who have been really good to me. At her funeral the music we said goodbye to her with was the song her and my dad had their first dance to after they were married ‘Always Look on the Bright Side of Life’, Monty Python’s classic, and that is because she always did. Even when life was jolly rotten, she continued smiling through, and that is what I have to do.\nLast week I sat in front of the Overview and Scrutiny committee presenting my first Housing Revenue Account Budget, it was exactly a month after my Mum’s funeral and getting up to the table to speak was a huge achievement for me. What I presented was a forward thinking paper which set out plans on how we will use HRA funding to deliver more and improved housing, that meets local needs, addresses affordability issues driving the housing crisis, supports measures around tackling homelessness and drives work around the sustainability of the stock ensuring it is fit for purpose for not just now but 50 years time. And whilst getting those words out, felt like climbing Everest barefoot, when I did it felt so good.\nAt the minute I am up and down, and when I am down I am really down, but I think it is very natural. To lose your best friend, the one person who loves you unconditionally is so hard, and it is really just starting to sink in. But I know that mum would want me to be positive, and that she would want me to carry on, working hard, and trying to help improve people’s lives in whatever way possible. Whether that was through building more social rented housing or just having time to chat them to talk through their problems.\nTomorrow would have been her 63rd Birthday, instead of being in the house with her watching channel 5 movies and eating rubbish, I will be at the Homelessness Reduction Board, continuing the collaborative work we have started to bring an end to homelessness, it is what she would have loved me to be doing.\nI want to thank everyone who has supported me throughout. It is really hard of course and it will be for a while, but I’ll get there. As they say when you’re chewing on life’s gristle, Don’t grumble, give a whistle! And this’ll help things turn out for the best.\nDu, Du, Du du du!\nLove you mum x",

May 2019 might seem like a long way off, but when you have to plan an election and the number of electors that can vote for you has doubled, six months will go pretty quickly. So, I already have one eye on the next election. In my formative years I was part of the 34th Bournemouth Scout Group, where we were taught to ‘always be prepared’. By thinking about my election this far in advance, that is what I am trying to do.\nPart of that preparation is looking for candidates to run with me in the ward, the next election will more than likely see the merging of Throop, Muscliff and Strouden Park, doubling the electorate and cutting the number of seats from six to three. I want to see good people take those seats and I also want a reduction in the party politics we experience in local government. Too many times, even in my short time as a councillor, many at the council have put politics ahead of you and your needs, which quite frankly that isn’t acceptable.\nSo I want to talk to you about Lisa who I have asked to run with me next year. Some of you may know her better as Lisa Northover and I am sure many of you will have already voted for her when she stood in the 2010 General Election as a Liberal Democrat candidate acquiring 13,592 votes. Between 2007 and 2011, Lisa was elected as the councillor for Boscombe West. During her period as a councillor, she did so much for her residents. Throughout the years, she has campaigned locally on housing issues resulting in positive action, many of which have improved local peoples living conditions. Lisa has also run several community projects including one to plant 500 fruit trees in our town. She has lived in Bournemouth her whole life, works for a local charity, and was also a Non Executive Director of a local NHS Trust.\nWhilst all of this makes for an impressive CV, this stuff isn’t why I want Lisa to run with me. If she had no previous experience and she hadn’t improved the lives of so many in her ward in the past, it would make no difference to me. That is because Lisa is everything someone representing you should be. She is intelligent, caring and fierce when she needs to be. Lisa is one of the main reasons I became a councillor. My election team was made up of just three people; me, my father, who would deliver leaflets when he could, and Lisa, who designed my leaflets and guided me through the campaign. In fact, she was the one who encouraged me to run in the first place. She was only ever a message away and was always ready with an answer or solution I could use. Which is exactly what you need from a councillor, right?\nJust like Anne Rey, Lisa used to be a Lib Dem and just like Anne Rey, she has become disillusioned with the party politics that have eroded democracy within this town. Over the last ten years, the conservative party has dominated the make up of the council – currently they are 51 of the 54 councillors – yet many feel that things within the town are getting worse. Homelessness, anti-social behaviour, and in my ward there is a serious problem with parking. This summer around Kingfisher Barn, there has been ridiculous amounts of litter and reports of abusing the natural environment. Whilst I have tried to listen and put your problems forward, without the support of councillors who have no agenda around me, my hands have at times been tied. I am approaching my eleventh month in the role and even in this short time, I have learned a lot, but the main thing I have learnt is that there are not enough councillors with the characteristics that Lisa possesses, and it is you who is suffering because of it. So, I am proud to announce that Lisa is running with me in the next election and when we both get elected, we will be a dynamic duo not to be messed with.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2020_05_31_the-cabinet-of-cool/content_19.html": "The Tories leadership are back to playing politics, nothing unusual there. But to do it in the midst of a global pandemic, a pandemic in which their national government’s response has been so poor, after the death of one of our councillors, is quite something. We are living in unprecedented times, so I guess it is quite reassuring to see somethings still don’t change. But this power play has come at the worst time, when we all need to focus on getting through the rest of this crisis, and managing a delicate recovery. It’s an unnecessary and crass distraction.\nIn the ridiculous press release announcing their attempt to gain power they planted a few slogans and phrases that I’m sure we will be seeing more of over the next week as this plays out. One of really witty phrases was one calling the cabinet, a ‘cabinet of compromise’ *sighs*. Which I bet they thought was genius. As if compromising is the worst possible quality decision makers could possess. I think compromise is only truly unacceptable to a tyrant or a dictator. Go figure. I’ve already seen a number of opposition councillors regurgitate it on the twitter feeds.\nWell I would like to take you behind the scenes of that cabinet, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to rename it, ‘the cabinet of cool’. The re-brand is equally as awful and cringe as their’s, I admit, but there are very few adjectives beginning with ‘C’ that so perfectly describe the cabinet. As pulled from Wikipedia the definition Coolness is an ascetic of attitude, behavior, appearance and style which is generally admired. It has associations with self control and composure. Which are exactly the qualities you need when making difficult decisions under pressure. So I want to take you through each cabinet member and explain to you what makes them so damn cool.\nI’m going to start with Dr. Felicity Rice, or as she will insist you call her, Fizz. There is nothing cooler in this life than being 100% true to who you are, and she does this. She is the cabinet’s conscience, she pushes us to really consider the effects of all of our decisions, she makes sure we weigh up the consequences in the short and long term, the impact on the environment and climate change, her portfolio, and how we can do things better in all aspects. Which are the qualities we need in creating a better place to live after the crisis.\nNext up is the funniest cabinet member, Lesley Dedman, she’s absolutely and utterly brilliant, her humour is razor sharp and she can cut an opponent in a debate with one line. She is never fazed by anything which so important, especially as she has been in charge of the most important portfolio during this pandemic, Adult Health and social care and done a phenomenal job. Cool? She drives a Jag and dresses as though she edits vogue. Enough said.\nDavid Brown, or as I like to call him, Casanova, he’s very romantic and we can be often found chatting about our love lives or lack of them. He is calculated, he weighs up risk, balancing it with reward, the perfect person to be in charge of the finance portfolio. His coolness is questionable due to the large collection of Star Trek memorabilia he sells. But it’s very cool he has a heart of gold, because if this government doesn’t support local councils adequately, we can cut it out and sell it.\nAndy Hadley, is one of the cleverest people I know. His knowledge of his Transport portfolio is second to none. Bournemouth has the worst congestion of any town in this country, thanks to the previous administration. Andy is the man to change that. He’s very cool, got a Back to the Future Doc Brown vibe, but the intelligence to back it up, could make socks and sandals look good.\nNot giving up is the hallmark of a champion, and Lewis Alison could have easily thrown in the towel after his first six months in the role. The most inexperienced of us, faced what could probably be described as bullying by some Tories, but dug in, stuck at it, and now made the real strides in his Tourism and Leisure portfolio. Big ideas for the future of tourism in a post-covid world. He’s made of the right stuff, and when going the got tough he got going. Ice cool.\nMargret Phipps, in charge of strategic planning, cares about the green belt and preserving it. She always says what she believes, which is exactly what you want from someone representing you. She has a vast amount of experience to call upon, which is handy for those without. She also has horses which is very cool, and I hope she reads this because I’d really like to meet them when the virus is gone.\nSandra Moore, looks after the children’s portfolio, and she is an encyclopaedia of local knowledge. She knows so many stories of the three towns past, and knowing your history is so important in shaping the future. Can enjoy a good moan, but always ends up laughing at the end of it. Very cool, younger than her years, only problem is she prefers Cats to Dogs. Nero wasn’t impressed.\nMark Howell lives and breaths regeneration his portfolio, has a strong vision to revitalise our town centres but wants to be inclusive. He welcomes challenges and accepts new ideas better than his own. Very excited to work with him on Holes Bay, a Housing project with so much potential. At the last election he strolled in wearing an outfit that would have made Willy Wonka blush, came out re-elected, only he could pull it off. That’s cool.\nThen there is our leader Vikki Slade. My favourite band is the Stone Roses, who coined the name after wanting to get the perfect balance of soft and hard. And that’s what Vikki is, she cares so very deeply about every single one of you, but she’s ready to make difficult decisions and to defend challenges against the Tories. She has so much energy I don’t know where she gets it from. And of course she is cool, I’ve just compared her to the coolest band in the world.\nFinally there’s me. Well somebody has to make the tea, take notes and tell jokes, right?\nYou know what is really cool is that we are a team, a diverse collective, from all walks of life, each with our own style. And we don’t compromise, we challenge each other to come to the best possible conclusion for you. Always looking to improve and learn. We don’t start from the conservative presumption that we are right and that is that. We weight it all up. We consider it. And we take action. It is calm and composed, some might even say cool. It’s the best governance this conurbation has ever seen. Led by the best leader this conurbation has ever seen.\nShe’ll carry on through it all, she’s a waterfall. – Stone Roses",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_14/content_65.html": "Before I got elected as a Councillor I wrote an impassioned letter to Dame Jane Goodall, regarding a number of different things, but at the heart of it was my concern about the proposed developments on Bournemouth’s greenbelt land. The greenbelt surrounding the conurbation is currently under great threat by this conservative council, and quite frankly it’s vanity.\nThe council won funding from the Conservative national government to cover the costs of the development, £65 million in total, however the only thing they can spend this money on is a flawed project destined to cause more problems in the long term. The proposals are so flawed in fact the planning officer objected to them and then stepped down from the project. Since they have adjusted their proposals, but they are not proposals to be adjusted but scrapped all together. I have been against the scheme since 2017 when I first heard about it, and shared a platform with Bournemouth East’s MP Tobias Elwood objecting against it during the General Election campaign. Since writing the letter to Jane, there has also been another issue regarding conservation within my own ward. That of Hicks Farm in the beautiful village of Throop. To say it has got my residents talking is an understatement, the consultation recently was lively, and gave a lot of people food for thought. Even though I consider myself to have an open mind on what happens at Hicks Farm, the consensus I felt is that any building work had to be in keeping with the scale and personality of Throop. If the council put in a planning application that doesn’t do this, I will be standing alongside my residents fighting to stop it, as is my duty to them.\nMy letter to Jane was my way of venting against what I saw as injustice, at the time I had no influence, I was thinking about running but hadn’t committed to doing so, but I just care so much about preserving the beauty of this town. It is our greatest asset, and Thoop and Holdenhurst are really jewels in Bournemouth’s crown. I never expected to get a reply from her, let alone the one I received a few months later. One sunny May morning just a couple of days before the FA Cup final, a letter came through the post. I didn’t recognise the handwriting and anticipated another concerned residents correspondence about something the council had failed to do. Instead to my amazement, when I opened it I had the sweetest note from my long standing idol, which is now safely secured in my treasure box. She wanted to meet me. I was excited to say the least, Jane tours the world spreading her message of hope, conservation and sustainability in universities and on theatre stages across the globe, from Bangkok to Baltimore, so finding a time to meet was always going to be difficult. She rarely gets a minute to herself. However after numerous emails back and forth with her secretary, Claire, a couple of weeks ago I received one with a date and an address.\nAnd just like that Dame Jane Goodall was pouring me a cup of tea in her living room, whilst her sister Judy cut me a slice of the most moist gluten free cake you’re ever likely to taste. I honestly felt as though I was in a dream, the word surreal doesn’t even cover it. At first I found it hard to speak, my mouth didn’t seem to want to open and when it did it was saying the most trivial things, here I was with an absolute icon and for one of the few times in my life I was speechless.\nEventually though once we started talking about the important issues of the day, particularly in Bournemouth, I couldn’t stop. She asked about the A338, I explained to her the paradoxical nature of the development, aimed to ease congestion, yet will create, according to the portfolio holder himself, Mike Greene, 2,000 new jobs on an accompanying site built for offices and new business. It is obvious to anyone without their head in the sand that 2,000 new jobs will cause an increase in traffic. I told her about the recent success of saving the Cob Barn, a building of over 500 years old. Yet despite this success, the council will just move their plans to cut into more of the greenbelt we are trying to save. I praised the activism within the area that has been a constant thorn in the council’s side, much of which has been coming from residents in my own ward, the council needs to be scrutinised and they are an important part of that role. Jane was disappointed with what she was hearing, but not surprised, but she told me to keep going, ‘keep doing what you are doing’.\nSometimes in this role it can be demoralising, the politics, the daunting size of the majority this conservative council has, but hearing your hero say you have to keep fighting is something that will stick with me, in this role and in whatever role I’m in come next May, and I always will keep standing up for what I believe is right. As Jane put another log on the fire, and I poured myself another cup of tea, it was my turn to listen, as Jane spoke about her work through her foundation ‘Roots and Shoots’ in Tanzania, and across the world. We talked at length about the problems of the world, Trump, the Paris Climate agreement, about the state of politics in Brazil, the importance of travel. And we ended on a positive note as I told her about the kindness I received throughout the world, especially in Rome. Before we knew it, almost two hours went just like that, Jane had to take her leave to make a conference call, another good fight to fight no doubt. As I left Jane’s house, I really left a different person, filled with hope, with fight, and with understanding of what it is to show humility despite being incredible.\nConserving Bournemouth’s beauty and character are high on my agenda, the A338 improvement scheme will not do this. It is, to all intents and purposes, a vanity project that will cause so many more problems in the long term than it will solve in the short term. Bournemouth was recently named the greenest town in the UK for the second year running, and the council are happy to take the credit for this. But when it comes to conserving the treasured greenbelt around the conurbation they are only too quick to sign off the planning application.\nAs I sign off this post, I want to congratulate those who helped to save the Cob Barn, Jane says ‘keep fighting’, I want to shame the council who over the last two decades have allowed it to deteriorate. And ask why are both the local and national conservative government are so intent on wasting your money?",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_9/content_45.html": "I’m nearly four months into my new role as Housing portfolio holder. And I’m loving all of it. Well nearly all of it. I adore being your representative, l love working towards housing more people but I hate being a politician.\nLast month I went over to Finland and was so inspired to hear about the work they were doing in housing, both in dealing with homelessness, but also the issue of affordability, especially in terms of young people like myself. One organisation called NAL was a non-profit that provided high quality, truly affordable housing for those under the age of 30 who needed it. The UK is crying out for such an organisation.\nI also met with Juha Kaakinen the CEO of the Y-foundation. Another non-profit providing Housing First. His foundation has been the biggest factor in making Finland the only country in the EU where homelessness is on the decline. I could have listened to him all day, he had so much experience and knowledge. But there were two main differences I could see between our country and his. The first was the mentality towards housing, perceiving it as a basic human right rather than an investment or commodity. Secondly was that Finland had realised in order to house everyone you need houses, and that those houses have to be truly affordable. The few hours I spent in the company of these groups was invaluable. I left Finland, with books, notes and a number of ideas, feeling energised and optimistic about the future.\nBut that was short lived as I realised the opposition are determined politics gets in the way. Earlier this week I had to go in front of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to defend a two part report on Project Admiral. Project Admiral referring to a £20 million renovation of 4 council owned tower blocks agreed by the former borough of Poole, to improve fire safety standards, eliminate damp and make it a better place for people to live.\nThe first part was an open report that asked for £750,000 in order to buy back properties from leaseholders who have ill health or experiencing real financial hardships. The second part was exempt to the public for legal reasons, but was around what the leaseholders should pay per the section 20 of their lease.\nI received a rough ride and politics really played its part. Despite being well briefed, knowing I had come to the recommendations that I felt were best, I still came out with a few bruises. In fairness there were traps I shouldn’t have fell for, and bate I should of taken and with time I’m sure I won’t. However the conservative members weren’t there to add value, as they so often claim. If they were they would have suggested an option to take. Instead they just wanted to provide me with a few sleepless nights and they succeeded.\nThat O&S meeting really got me thinking, and that Monday night I really couldn’t sleep, twisting and turning over the arguments and the numerous scenarios put to me around the options in the exempt report. As well as the open one. However what eventually helped me get to sleep was the obvious fact that was staring me in the face the whole time, it’s a fact that’s not changed since I became a councillor. It’s why I am a Councillor.\nI am fundamentally different in my way of thinking to those who posed the arguments to me.\nMy main concerns when considering the options were fairness and how to keep a good relationship with leaseholders, to enable future access to properties when needed and ensuring they uphold their responsibility as Leaseholders. Whilst also minimising the risk of going to tribunal. Despite knowing we have an extremely strong case if brought in front of a judge.\nCertain members at the meeting described two classes when differentiating the leaseholders from those renting. Well I could only see one class. I could only see people who live in the same tower block who all have the same aspiration to live a good life how they want to, and all with their own pressures whether that be financial or health. All of whom will be affected by the works but all of whom will have a better place to live once those works are finished.\nOne member then went on to ask how other council tenants would feel about the money coming out of the HRA to support residents affected. Well speaking as a Council tenant I am fine with that. I understand that not every penny this council spends has to benefit me, and more over I can put myself in the shoes of those leaseholders, most of whom have become property rich but cash poor by trying to get a foot on the ladder, a stake in society, and I can sympathise with them being fronted by such a heavy bill.\nI didn’t come to the decision lightly, no one on the cabinet came to the decision lightly. I joked at the meeting, when posed with various outlandish scenarios that went from one extreme to another that ‘it’s my sword and I’ll fall on it’ well I was wrong, it’s my sword and I’ll raise it. We as a cabinet and an alliance are doing things differently now. And that’s good, in fact it’s great.\nWe are now more transparent and communicating better than any previous administration. One Conservative voting resident of mine asked ‘how come you’re so much better at communicating than the last lot?’ I said it’s because we want to talk to you. Just last week we had residents round the table talking about Hicks Farm with the local MP. That wouldn’t have been forthcoming previously.\nAnd so the next night after not being able to sleep the previous one I took a page out of Cllr David Brown’s book and went to play some of the craziest golf I’ve ever played with a lovely girl I’ve been seeing, I got home and I slept like a baby safe in the knowledge that this alliance cares about people rather than politics.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_3/content_7.html": "It’s been a while, I hope you are all taking care during these difficult times.\nWe are in such a hard moment, as an area and as a country, and at times there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel. So during this period you have to take whatever little victories and joys you can and last week there was a fantastic one. It was announced that the BCP Council would be part of the new cohort of the What Works Community ran by the Centre for Homelessness Impact. CHI are an incredible organisation whose objective is to use evidence and data to bring about a sustainable end to homelessness.\nI first encountered the Centre for Homelessness Impact at Housing 2019, when I went to a seminar in which the Chief Executive, Ligia Teixeria, gave a brilliant presentation on the work being done by the organization. Ever since I have used their website as a resource. I think there are similarities between the council and CHI, we are new, bright, innovative organisations with a passion to end homelessness. At the back end of last year we joined CHI and Cardiff University in a smaller research project that looked at what we did over the course of the first lockdown with the intention of improving the outcomes of those we were providing services to, which is still on going.\nHomelessness and all it encompasses has often been a subject that has been overlooked when it comes to studying and understanding it, particularly when it comes to policy making. The work they do is so vital. That is why one of my last acts as the Cabinet Member for Housing was to write to the Chief Executive of the Council to get authorisation to be part of the What Works Community scheme.\nSpanning the fields of behavioural insights, design thinking and data-informed decision making, the programme supports local authorities to develop a culture of continuous innovation, and enhance their ability to use evidence and data to tackle homelessness by focusing on ‘what works’ – https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/community\nBy being a part of this it places Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole quite literally on the map in terms of being a leader in homeless services, but also enables the council to feed into the evidence base that will decide future policy, and that is vital. Although there has been a change of administration, there doesn’t seem yet to have been a change in direction in the approach to homelessness, which is positive and a credit to the new lead on homelessness. Though I will be keeping a close eye to make sure we continue to head in the right direction, I think the administration understand the great work we were doing in housing and homelessness (below are a list of some of the Key successes we had over the last 12 months) and know it would be foolish to divert course.\nThe last few months have been odd for me, after losing my role as Cabinet Member for Housing, especially when it wasn’t for doing a poor job, which would have been much easier to accept. I went from a not having any time to myself, to nearly only having time to myself, though that soon changed again. I am still doing a lot of work in the ward, helping businesses receive their discretionary grants, sorting disputes out between residents and the council on many different subjects, going to every sub-group of the Homelessness Partnership under the sun and so much more.\nTomorrow I will be in attendance at the final All Party Parliamentary Group on Ending Homeless listening to some of my heroes in the sector explain to a panel Co-Chaired by Bob Blackman MP and Neil Coyle MP, about what needs to be done to eradicate homelessness within the country, which I am really excited about. Yet it still isn’t that same intensity as to when I was in the hot-seat.\nAnd in many ways I am grateful for that, it has been the first time I’ve been able to take some time out in a very challenging year and half, and -pun absolutely intended- I have been able to do what works for me to get through a tough time.\nKey successes\n• Overall reduction in Rough Sleeping across the conurbation\n• 1215 households prevented from homelessness in past 12 months\n• The Homeless Reduction Board and Homelessness Partnership launched. Over 60 organisations and services are involved with well over 100 individuals, with several focussed Action Groups.\n• The launch of the Homelessness Forum, increasing opportunities for collaboration, communication and consistent working.\n• Successful Let’s Talk Renting campaign to encourage early action in terms of prevention. This was a multi-agency approach to ensure maximum reach and success and is now being followed up by a Let’s Talk Money campaign.\n• A new Hospital Homeless Pathway team has been launched to provide better support and outcomes for people in hospital who are at risk of homelessness upon discharge. This multidisciplinary team includes housing, and this followed a pilot funded initially by the MHCLG Cold Weather Fund.\n• The BCP response to the Everyone In initiative during the Covid-19 pandemic has been recognised as very successful. This recognition belongs to all of the many agencies who were, and remain, part of this effort delivering collaborative support in health, substance dependency and food provision to just name a few examples.\n• Over 300 individuals placed in Emergency Accommodation as part of Everyone In, with more than 80 moved on to longer term accommodation.\n• Everyone who has been placed in emergency accommodation has had a thorough assessment of their housing, health and support needs, as part of ensuring that the best solutions are found for everyone.\n• A multi-agency Rough Sleeping Pathway has been a vital part of this approach, with an integrated working approach with various agencies working alongside the Local Authority Housing Team. This work will continue to be developed.\n• Development of working group considering local approach to accommodating people with No Recourse to Public Funds\n• Current review and refresh of Severe Weather Emergency Procedure (SWEP) Protocol via task and finish group.\n• Successful soft launch of Operation Luscombe in June 2020 to address begging and related antisocial behaviour, including by those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation. This is a support-led model although can result in enforcement as a last resort.\n• Imminent pilot launch of Contactless Giving scheme. This will allow members of the public who wish to donate in order to help those who are homeless, including those rough sleeping, by swiping their credit or debit card at several locations in the town centre of Bournemouth. This scheme will expand to the rest of the BCP area in due course. Funds go to Dorset Community Fund, who distribute to those in need, and all proceeds go to those affected by homelessness; all overhead have been covered by the Homelessness Partnership.\n• Lived experience group established collating feedback about their experience of local services\n• Rough Sleepers Initiative Grant fund award £1.4m\n• Next Steps Accommodation Programme grant fund award\n• A Housing First Service Level Agreement in place and property portfolio increased\n• Additional provision commissioned doubling the weekly capacity of the Health Bus which caters for those rough sleeping or in emergency accommodation.\n• Two Drug and Alcohol workers assigned to working with those in the Rough Sleeping Pathway, offering tailored interventions and support.\n• Imminent launch of new multi-agency group, Complex Homelessness & Risk Integrated Solutions Panel (CHRISP) to focus on complex cases and building on 3 legacy groups\n• BCP-wide single point of contact for financial help organised through Financial Resilience action group\n• Additional food support for those w/o access to food in Temporary Accommodation organised via faith/voluntary community\n• Community support action group aligning both move-on support and training opportunities",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_15/content_69.html": "‘Hi Ian See you have seen this one, need to play this close to us, not our job to help the green independents, received a few emails’\nIt’s been just over five months since I was elected to be Throop and Muscliff’s Councillor to proceed the energetic and hardworking Councillor, now Alderman, Anne Rey. Big shoes to fill. It has been quite a five months too, with very little time to take a breath. When I was first elected one commenter said that ‘he’ll be a lamb to the wolves’, in my time so far I would describe myself more as a cat amongst the pigeons.\nI haven’t been afraid to speak or do what I thought was right, in my first full council meeting I was the only councillor who voted against the rise in Council Tax to the maximum allowed; 5.99%. I fought for my seat on the Standards Committee to ensure opposition, formed a political group with Green Party candidate Simon Bull to make sure the Conservatives can’t go behind our backs. I redrew the proposed boundaries for Queens Park and Strouden Park to protect both areas identity and in October I will become the youngest Group Leader in the history of Bournemouth Council. Most recently I called out the Mayor for ‘playing’ politics. It is quite literally the word he used when he sent an email by mistake to a resident. Politics is not a game. It is people’s lives and that can often be lost when we are sat round tables at the Pavilion sipping a class of prosecco making a toast to the new Mayor.\nEveryone is prone to mistakes, in the first full meeting when I voted against Council Tax, I also voted against the budget, believing that since a lot of the budget is made up of Council Tax, it didn’t make sense to vote for one and not the other. Councillor Lawerence Williams, the then Mayor, told me after the meeting that he could have stopped the meeting and asked me for an ‘alternative budget’. He was kind not to, they take around six months to produce, it would have been embarrassing. But what the new Mayor Derek Borthwick did was cynical and machiavellian, not technical, like my mistake, but intentional. He wanted to ‘play this close’ keep others out, namely ‘Green Independents’, and I called him on it in the Echo. Being the Mayor is a non-political role, unbiased, a ceremonial position to be the first citizen of Bournemouth, but even regardless of that fact, it is bad practice to keep ‘things close’ in what we consider as an open democracy.\nThe Mayor offered, in the Echo, to give me an apology, and I haven’t taken him up on it. Not because I am petty, but because I really don’t feel it is me he should be apologising to, it should be the residents that help pay for his chauffeur.\nSince the article we met on two occasions, both very amicable, I felt what’s done is done. The second occasion was at the TMSTH Area Forum, a productive meeting with residents, they normally are. During the meeting a number of people put forward an issue regarding the Number 4 Yellow Bus that had stopped going to Bournemouth Hospital, instead terminating at Castlepoint. Not only is it important for many older residents to get to the hospital, but it is also a main bus stop to go to places such as Salisbury for a day out. I took the microphone and suggested that myself, Mayor Borthwick and fellow ward Councillor Ian Clark should arrange a meeting with the Yellow Buses and the effected residents, to try to convince them to extend that service a few stops. It is not a huge ask, and would make the world of difference to a number of residents. Both seemed keen when put on the spot, I said I would email them later that night, which is what I did.\nThe reply I received the next morning astounded me.\nDear Councillor Wilson\nAfter our meeting last evening I was made aware by Derek Borthwick of your recent article in the Bournemouth Echo concerning the Mayor. I find it completely outrageous that you should disrespect the Mayor of Bournemouth in this way especially in his first weeks of office.\nI will not be prepared to work with you on any local matters until you make a public apology to The Mayor of Bournemouth.\nRegards Ian\nAt first I laughed, then I checked the date, no it wasn’t the first of April, he was serious. I sat there staring at it for five minutes, gobsmacked, but then I felt my blood starting to boil. He is willing to put politics before his residents and their very simple cause, at least the Mayor was trying to hide his intentions.\nHim wanting me to apologise for exposing wrong doing I just found hilarious.\nHim not wanting to work with me for the benefit of residents I found ridiculous.\nAt the top of the piece I mentioned some of the things I’ve done as a councillor, that stuff accounts for around 10% of what I have actually done. That’s the more glamorous side of it. The other 90% is the real work. It is answering your emails, putting forward questions to council on your behalf. It is going round your house for a cup of tea and a chat, not always having the solutions to your problems, but always being an ear to bend. It is fixing streetlights, and fighting excessive rent rises. It is objecting to planning applications and attending meetings. It is smiling when someone says to you ‘it’s nice to see someone younger getting involved’ and it is trying to live up to Ron and Anne. It is working for you a resident of Bournemouth, and more specifically Throop and Muscliff. And I have felt privileged every second since I was elected to represent you.\nSo when some uses you, the resident, as a political hostage, to try to make me apologise, well ‘I find it completely outrageous’.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_11/content_31.html": "A year and a half ago when I won my by-election I was in earshot of a conservative Councillor stating ‘He’ll be a lamb to the slaughter’ I’ve never forgotten it and I never will. Since then I’ve held the Tories to account, won another election gaining the most votes in Bournemouth, and last night I became the portfolio holder for Housing and Deputy Leader of an administration that kicked the tories out of power. If this is how lambs get slaughtered I no longer need to be a vegetarian.\nWhat was achieved over the last few weeks was no small feat. People will probably never understand just how hard it was. Bringing together five different groups, from all backgrounds, ages and politics, to work together was never going to be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is right? The 7:00 am meetings, the sleeplessness nights, and seemingly endless talks, at times were a struggle. But this Unity Alliance has so much more uniting us than dividing us. We are all centred around the common goal of leaving the conurbation in a much better state than we left it, we care about the environment, we want transparency, openness and inclusiveness. Not just amongst councillors, but with you as residents. We work for you, people before politics, partnership over partisanship. Be under no illusions though the next four years are going to be tough. The tories will jump on any mistake, and exaggerate it no end. They’ll scrutinise, as they should, and it will be our job to make sure we are up to that scrutiny.\nThis is an opportunity of a lifetime, one that I never thought would come along. Exactly two years ago I was running in the General Election, my main pledge was to try and find a solution to ending homelessness and rough sleeping within Bournemouth. I didn’t feel there was a political will to do so. Now I’m in a position to do that. I can’t quite believe it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have all the answers, but there is certainly no one in this town who is more committed to find those answers than me.\nIt would be so wrong of me to sit here and pretend that this is my victory, it’s not, it’s yours. I am nothing without your support and of course your votes. And I haven’t had a chance to thank everyone who voted for myself and Lisa. We worked so hard during the campaign and you guys recognised that. You voted for change and you’ve got it. You’re no longer shouting into the wind, instead you are in power alongside us. And it’s genuinely exciting. The next four years aren’t going to be a stroll in the park, but we are setting out with the very best of intentions and that’s more than can be said about previous administrations.\nI want wrap up this post by thanking Vikki (she’s going to be a fantastic leader), Mark, Margret, Fizz, George, Stephen and all of those that went into talks a week ago with an open mind, willing to listen and compromise when needed. I want to thank Simon, Chris and Lisa for putting their faith in me as the Group Leader of the Bournemouth Group, to fight for the interests of their residents and of Bournemouth itself. We can’t say for certain what the next four years will bring, but I can say that I’ve never been more excited for the future of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch.",

And I’m loving all of it. Well nearly all of it. I adore being your representative, l love working towards housing more people but I hate being a politician.\nLast month I went over to Finland and was so inspired to hear about the work they were doing in housing, both in dealing with homelessness, but also the issue of affordability, especially in terms of young people like myself. One organisation called NAL was a non-profit that provided high quality, truly affordable housing for those under the age of 30 who needed it. The UK is crying out for such an organisation.\nI also met with Juha Kaakinen the CEO of the Y-foundation. Another non-profit providing Housing First. His foundation has been the biggest factor in making Finland the only country in the EU where homelessness is on the decline. I could have listened to him all day, he had so much experience and knowledge. But there were two main differences I could see between our country and his. The first was the mentality towards housing, perceiving it as a basic human right rather than an investment or commodity. Secondly was that Finland had realised in order to house everyone you need houses, and that those houses have to be truly affordable. The few hours I spent in the company of these groups was invaluable. I left Finland, with books, notes and a number of ideas, feeling energised and optimistic about the future.\nBut that was short lived as I realised the opposition are determined politics gets in the way. Earlier this week I had to go in front of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to defend a two part report on Project Admiral. Project Admiral referring to a £20 million renovation of 4 council owned tower blocks agreed by the former borough of Poole, to improve fire safety standards, eliminate damp and make it a better place for people to live.\nThe first part was an open report that asked for £750,000 in order to buy back properties from leaseholders who have ill health or experiencing real financial hardships. The second part was exempt to the public for legal reasons, but was around what the leaseholders should pay per the section 20 of their lease.\nI received a rough ride and politics really played its part. Despite being well briefed, knowing I had come to the recommendations that I felt were best, I still came out with a few bruises. In fairness there were traps I shouldn’t have fell for, and bate I should of taken and with time I’m sure I won’t. However the conservative members weren’t there to add value, as they so often claim. If they were they would have suggested an option to take. Instead they just wanted to provide me with a few sleepless nights and they succeeded.\nThat O&S meeting really got me thinking, and that Monday night I really couldn’t sleep, twisting and turning over the arguments and the numerous scenarios put to me around the options in the exempt report. As well as the open one. However what eventually helped me get to sleep was the obvious fact that was staring me in the face the whole time, it’s a fact that’s not changed since I became a councillor. It’s why I am a Councillor.\nI am fundamentally different in my way of thinking to those who posed the arguments to me.\nMy main concerns when considering the options were fairness and how to keep a good relationship with leaseholders, to enable future access to properties when needed and ensuring they uphold their responsibility as Leaseholders. Whilst also minimising the risk of going to tribunal. Despite knowing we have an extremely strong case if brought in front of a judge.\nCertain members at the meeting described two classes when differentiating the leaseholders from those renting. Well I could only see one class. I could only see people who live in the same tower block who all have the same aspiration to live a good life how they want to, and all with their own pressures whether that be financial or health. All of whom will be affected by the works but all of whom will have a better place to live once those works are finished.\nOne member then went on to ask how other council tenants would feel about the money coming out of the HRA to support residents affected. Well speaking as a Council tenant I am fine with that. I understand that not every penny this council spends has to benefit me, and more over I can put myself in the shoes of those leaseholders, most of whom have become property rich but cash poor by trying to get a foot on the ladder, a stake in society, and I can sympathise with them being fronted by such a heavy bill.\nI didn’t come to the decision lightly, no one on the cabinet came to the decision lightly. I joked at the meeting, when posed with various outlandish scenarios that went from one extreme to another that ‘it’s my sword and I’ll fall on it’ well I was wrong, it’s my sword and I’ll raise it. We as a cabinet and an alliance are doing things differently now. And that’s good, in fact it’s great.\nWe are now more transparent and communicating better than any previous administration. One Conservative voting resident of mine asked ‘how come you’re so much better at communicating than the last lot?’ I said it’s because we want to talk to you. Just last week we had residents round the table talking about Hicks Farm with the local MP. That wouldn’t have been forthcoming previously.\nAnd so the next night after not being able to sleep the previous one I took a page out of Cllr David Brown’s book and went to play some of the craziest golf I’ve ever played with a lovely girl I’ve been seeing, I got home and I slept like a baby safe in the knowledge that this alliance cares about people rather than politics.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_13/content_62.html": "The curse of winning a by-election so close to the full elections is that as you’ve just started to find your feet you already have to start thinking about your next election. May 2019 might seem like a long way off, but when you have to plan an election and the number of electors that can vote for you has doubled, six months will go pretty quickly. So, I already have one eye on the next election. In my formative years I was part of the 34th Bournemouth Scout Group, where we were taught to ‘always be prepared’. By thinking about my election this far in advance, that is what I am trying to do.\nPart of that preparation is looking for candidates to run with me in the ward, the next election will more than likely see the merging of Throop, Muscliff and Strouden Park, doubling the electorate and cutting the number of seats from six to three. I want to see good people take those seats and I also want a reduction in the party politics we experience in local government. Too many times, even in my short time as a councillor, many at the council have put politics ahead of you and your needs, which quite frankly that isn’t acceptable.\nSo I want to talk to you about Lisa who I have asked to run with me next year. Some of you may know her better as Lisa Northover and I am sure many of you will have already voted for her when she stood in the 2010 General Election as a Liberal Democrat candidate acquiring 13,592 votes. Between 2007 and 2011, Lisa was elected as the councillor for Boscombe West. During her period as a councillor, she did so much for her residents. Throughout the years, she has campaigned locally on housing issues resulting in positive action, many of which have improved local peoples living conditions. Lisa has also run several community projects including one to plant 500 fruit trees in our town. She has lived in Bournemouth her whole life, works for a local charity, and was also a Non Executive Director of a local NHS Trust.\nWhilst all of this makes for an impressive CV, this stuff isn’t why I want Lisa to run with me. If she had no previous experience and she hadn’t improved the lives of so many in her ward in the past, it would make no difference to me. That is because Lisa is everything someone representing you should be. She is intelligent, caring and fierce when she needs to be. Lisa is one of the main reasons I became a councillor. My election team was made up of just three people; me, my father, who would deliver leaflets when he could, and Lisa, who designed my leaflets and guided me through the campaign. In fact, she was the one who encouraged me to run in the first place. She was only ever a message away and was always ready with an answer or solution I could use. Which is exactly what you need from a councillor, right?\nJust like Anne Rey, Lisa used to be a Lib Dem and just like Anne Rey, she has become disillusioned with the party politics that have eroded democracy within this town. Over the last ten years, the conservative party has dominated the make up of the council – currently they are 51 of the 54 councillors – yet many feel that things within the town are getting worse. Homelessness, anti-social behaviour, and in my ward there is a serious problem with parking. This summer around Kingfisher Barn, there has been ridiculous amounts of litter and reports of abusing the natural environment. Whilst I have tried to listen and put your problems forward, without the support of councillors who have no agenda around me, my hands have at times been tied. I am approaching my eleventh month in the role and even in this short time, I have learned a lot, but the main thing I have learnt is that there are not enough councillors with the characteristics that Lisa possesses, and it is you who is suffering because of it. So, I am proud to announce that Lisa is running with me in the next election and when we both get elected, we will be a dynamic duo not to be messed with.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson/content_4.html": "One of my earliest Christmases, I can’t remember which, Santa brought me a book called Can’t You Sleep, Little Bear? It was in a small themed gift bag and came with a Little Bear toy. I adored it; the book, the toy and the bag. So much so I kept it decades on. And I am actually looking at it as I write this now.\nThe plot as you can imagine is a simple one. It is a heartwarming story of Big Bear helping Little Bear, get to sleep. Despite his best efforts he can’t overcome his fear of the dark. So Big Bear takes it upon himself to relieve Little Bear of this anxiety. He does this by bringing him bigger and bigger lanterns, until eventually he takes him outside of their cave to show him how the moon – the biggest lantern of them all – is always there. And eventually Little Bear falls to sleep in Big Bear’s arms, in the comfort of their cave.\nIt’s message is about the connection of love between parents and children, as well as a child’s need for comfort, security and having their fears allayed. The story is always quite close to my heart, but it rose to the surface recently after the work we as a Council and Homelessness Partnership have done to significantly reduce our reliance on Bed and Breakfast (B&B) accommodation.\nB&B accommodation is the most challenging to live in; there often isn’t a suitable space for a child to do their homework or facilities for parents to cook decent meals. It really doesn’t have the conditions for a family to live and thrive as they should. It is a last resort and our dependence on it was costly to the welfare of the families living in it. I can imagine Little Bear not fully understanding why he’s in this strange place, without all his toys around him. And wondering why Big Bear is so worried?\nSo at the back end of last year we made a conscious decision, in agreement with the Homelessness Partnership, that we had to tackle this issue head on. We decided to acquire over 100 proper homes as a form of temporary accommodation. Somewhere that Big Bear can cook a Christmas dinner and put tree up for Little Bear.\nAlongside the acquisitions of homes we also put more focus on prevention. In doing this we had an increase of 30% in successfully keeping families in their home. And that is in a backdrop of a 13% increase in those coming to the council at risk of homelessness.\nWhat was the outcome of all this work? A 90% reduction in the course of a year in our use of B&B accommodation. Which is phenomenal, in a context where nationally we are seeing substantial rises in the use of B&B’s. At its peak not long after I took the role there were around 230 Children in B&B’s. Christmas Day last year we had 164 Children. Two days ago when we put out a press release we had 16. Today we have 14 Children in B&B, the number keeps dropping. And whilst it is still 14 too many, the reduction is such a source of pride for us. And I can only thank everyone that has made it happen. It is by no means the end of our work, in fact it is only the beginning. We will continue work tirelessly until everyone has a safe place that they can call home. But it is going in the right direction.\nIt has been a year with lots of change, but still many of the same challenges. Hopefully 2025 will bring us further reasons to be optimistic. If you’re reading this I hope you have the loveliest Christmas possible and the happiest of New Year’s. I have certainly got my present early this year knowing that 150 Little Bear’s will be sleeping slightly easier this Christmas Day.\nChristmas can be a difficult time for many people, and this can include concerns about the potential risk of homelessness.

  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_author_eddwilson_page_10/content_52.html": "The last seven weeks have aged me seven years but felt like seven minutes. I have learned so much in such a short space of time regarding housing; tenures to freeholds via CPOs. It has been a crazy period that has seen me open landlord conferences’ and begin dialogue with developers. But what I have really learned over the last two months is just how important a house is. It is more than bricks and mortar, windows and doors, carpets and curtains. It is our foundation, our stability, which we as people rely upon. It can be both the solution and cause of our problems. It’s where we argue and make up. It is where we burn our microwave meals before watching Corrie with a cuppa. It is where we spend most of our short existence. It is for these very reasons we must start looking at homes, and housing itself, differently.\nWhich is why one of the first things I have done as Housing Portfolio Holder is to put a blanket ban on the term ‘units’. Inspired by Channel 4’s resident architect George Clarke who I met at Housing 2019 (a conference held in Manchester last month). The logic behind it is, that it is a developer’s term, which is clinical and devoid of emotion. In fact when I first started I wasn’t exactly sure what a unit was or what it measured; beds, people, number of rooms? When we talk about ‘units’ we are talking about numbers, we are talking about the storage of people and their things inside of four very static walls. Rather than talking about their lives, exploring their needs and experiences, and the dynamic nature of home life. Whilst our housing targets set out by national government require use to maximise space, it doesn’t mean that we can’t build quality with these things in mind.\nThis is just one of the many ways in which we need to change our approach to housing, not just as a council but as a nation. There needs to a new approach to developments, built to create communities, where happiness not overheads are prioritised. Where we are thriving not surviving. There has to be a change of mentality around social renting too, the stigma needs to stop. I live in the same estate now as I always have done, and I am fully aware of the labels attached to council housing. The best way that we can influence this is by building more of it, and making it superior to that in the private rented sector. Much of which already is. In places like Vienna living in social rented housing is the norm, we need that here, especially as people of my age are now being labelled ‘generation rent’. Being part of that is fine. Buying a house is not for everyone, nor should it be, renting is brilliant. But the current levels of rent are not.\nSocial rent was a hot topic as I tried to get my Princess Road development through Cabinet and Full Council last week, why wasn’t there any? Which was more than a fair comment. Viability was the main answer, £5.1 million gap in funding. And the scheme does offer so many of the things that I believe are the answer to our housing problems. Mixed tenure, mixed communities, and 72% affordable housing capped at the Local Housing Allowance. It will be excellent housing, excellently managed. The local policy only requires 40% at this moment in time, and that is almost never met in Private Sector developments. Which is something else that certainly needs to change. On the whole Princess Road is a good scheme, but it is just the start, it is the baseline to measure all future developments of that size upon.\nIn that same Full Council we also declared a climate emergency, an ambitious target that will see the council carbon neutral by 2030. This is a huge challenge, but one we must rise too. Housing is no exception; we need to be building more sustainable homes. We have 3 exemplar passive homes in West Howe, which are not only eco-friendly but have an increased building life and saw resident’s utility bills reduced significantly. These are fantastic. But 3 is simply not enough, we must be building more.\nThen there is the utilisation of limited land and utilising the housing we already have. A huge part of this is starting with brownfield sites, which is I was more than happy to put forward a proposal to unlock funding to create a site acquisition strategy for the Holes Bay Power Station in Poole. The power station came down in 1993; I wasn’t born. For the subsequent 26 years it has been of no use. We must be looking to these brownfield sites first, by trying to work with the private sector. However if it has to brought back into public ownership, through a negotiated purchase or compulsory purchase order, then this gives us a great opportunity to create something that meets all of the requirements I’ve set out over the last 5 paragraphs. And whilst only giving it a single line we really do need to look at ways of bring empty homes back into use.\nSo as you have read, there is a lot going on. Some of it I have a direct impact on, a lot of it I don’t. We are at a crossroads in Housing both as a conurbation and as a country. And there are so many reasons to be optimistic about it; people in the industry are providing the solutions. Now it is time for Governments to wake up from the housing coma we’ve been in over the last 40 years. Ultimately I believe everyone deserves a home, not a unit, which they can feel comfortable in, which they can afford, be that rented or owned. A place to hang their hat and cook their beans on toast.\nThis small change in wording is a huge change in mentality going forward. For me ‘how many units?’ is the measure I use nowadays whilst in town on a Friday to tell me when it is time to go home.",

  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized/content_11.html": "Today marks my fourth year as a councillor, which is the typical length of a term for someone in my position. It’s as long as Donald Trump got in the White House and a year longer than Theresa May got as Prime Minister. And so to mark the occasion I wanted to reflect, and write a long overdue piece for my blog.\nI won my first election by 22 votes, or as I like to think of it, a football match. Wearing an horrendous donkey jacket and a green knitted fleece which couldn’t have looked worse if I tried (evidence supplied below), I became the youngest member of the council. And straight away I had to learn, thrown into the deep end. A lamb to the slaughter one said on the night of my win. Within a few weeks I’d picked a fight with the Mayor and had started to understand just what local politics could be.\nMy first year and half was tough, it was trying to help residents whilst not being listened to in an opposition of 3 to 51 conservatives. I managed to achieve a few things, youngest group leader in the history of Bournemouth Council, standing against the Wessex field development, and funding seated garden area at Muscliff School which the kids, I’m reliably informed, love.\nI had my little scooter, Betsy, and if you had a problem, I’d be there in a flash, drinking your freshly made tea, tucking into a piece of battenburg, moaning with you about how things needed to change. Little did I know how much they would.\nBefore the full elections in May 2019, I really wasn’t sure I wanted to stand again, the first 18 months were tough, I’d enjoyed it in spells but it was depressing in opposition. But I felt a duty to my residents, and I’d managed to convince Lisa to stand with me. And it was the best decision I could have made, we smashed it, winning by a huge majority, I got the most votes in Bournemouth. And it was worth it just to see the smile on my mum’s face. From a 22 vote margin to a 1,022 vote margin was quite something.\nAnd for the next year and half it lead to me being able to do something I had set out to do when I first stood to be an MP. I became the Cabinet Member for Housing, and could have a direct influence on ending homelessness.\nOver my time on the cabinet I managed, with the support of my group and the Unity Alliance, to achieve so much.\nA huge reduction in rough sleeping with Housing First and a ‘health first’ approach that brought national recognition from MHCLG and a ministerial visit from the MP Luke Hall. The first social rented housing brought through in Bournemouth in over 20 years. Improved sustainability in our new builds to passive house standards which led to a letter from Dame Jane Goodall. The purchase of one of Europe’s largest brownfield sites, Holes Bay, to bring forward new affordable accommodation. And so much more, which I’m sure I’ve mentioned so many times you remember! But all of this lead to me being shortlisted for the country’s Young Councillor of the year.\nAnd then, under difficult circumstances, after the passing of two of our colleagues and more importantly our friends, and without the ability to have new elections during the pandemic we lost control of the council, and I lost my dream job.\nThe year since has been a struggle again, it’s so hard in opposition, you don’t have the same access to officers and information, or influence over decisions. I had to get a second job which as taken time and attention from my council work, thankfully they are a very understanding company. I’ve still been helping residents, answering emails, trying to solve issues. There was one case over the summer where housing officers misinterpreted the law, and my spotting their mistake allowed a number of vulnerable people to stay in their homes. The email of thanks from one resident made me well up. But it’s been hard.\nHowever, the thing I’m proudest of is the structures and cultures I put in place when in charge of Housing are still there. When I first arrived, there was no co-ordination in between the council and outside organisations, however when I left there was a homelessness reduction board and forum, with over 150 different stakeholders all pulling in the same direction to end homelessness. And there’s a specific group which helps those who have no access to public funding which has been so important. Everyone in should mean everyone.\nThere are small wins to be had as well, just yesterday at Health and Adult Social Care overview and scrutiny committee, I seconded a recommendation to ask cabinet members to write to our MPs asking for a review of the carer’s allowance which went up by just 35p a week in 2020, which passed.\nMy four years I’ve met some really interesting people, from the Governor of the Bank of England to those with lived experience of homelessness, each one I’ve learnt so much from, and I have made friends for life.\nSo far my time has been a rollercoaster, ups and downs, not just in the job, but personally after losing my mum, things haven’t been smooth, but it’s been such a privilege. To serve you, to work hard for you, to get things done for you and most importantly to make mistakes and to be forgiven by you.\nThankfully I don’t have to run for election for another year and a half but when they roll around in May 2023 I hope there are loads of good candidates standing, we need great people like you, yes you, running and winning, making the change this area needs. If I can do it, anyone can.",

Last Friday I was hosting the Conservative Minister for Rough Sleeping and Homelessness, who came down to see the exemplary work we have been doing for those vulnerable on our street. This Friday I am looking at losing my role, as last night the Conservatives put in another Vote of No Confidence. I always felt it was only a matter of time after the passing of my colleague and friend Pete Parish.\nSome part of me, is wondering if it is worth fighting, without the opportunity for by elections the numbers are not in our favour it seems, and I am a bit knackered if truth be told. It is hard at the top, and the conservatives are nothing if not relentless, biting at our heals. But having watched the Overview and Scrutiny meeting last week, and having experienced first hand the discourse and attitude some opposition members have towards those who are homeless in our community, I know that even if there is only a slim chance, we have to fight.\nBelieving that fining those who have do not have proper place to stay is a good idea, instantly drains my confidence in them. I had a lot of friends message to say this can’t be happening. And even in the face of the national outrage that was caused, a number of MP’s across the country even tweeted about it with a link to a Guardian article, they stuck by that line. During my time as the Housing Portfolio Holder there has been fantastic partnership working, which has led to great results, for the year 19/20, we saw a 37% rise in positive outcomes for those who were homeless. And the 20/21 figure will be much higher after our work during Covid. Ministers, especially ones from opposition parties, don’t come and visit often, so when they do you know you are doing something right.\nThat is not to say there isn’t a lot more work to be done, I feel responsible when I see or hear about anyone who doesn’t have a roof over their head in this conurbation. Yet, nationally the legislation needs to change, as do attitudes, something I mentioned to the Minster. He was extremely positive about the work, myself, my team and partner agencies had done during the pandemic, and indicated there is a good chance our Next Steps Accommodation Programme Bid, which totals over £5 million will be accepted due to our success so far. This will make such a difference to so many lives. Those on our streets have to be treated with compassion, not punished with draconian measures as the Tories recommended. And whilst the minister nationally seems to understand that, locally it is a different story.\nWhether or not I am the Portfolio Holder for Housing at the end of this month, the work we as a BCP Homelessness partnership has to continue. It is too important not to, but I fear it will be lost with a change of administration. Prevention is just as important in addressing the issue. There is no appetite for Social Housing in the opposition, I brought forward the first homes at social rent in over 20 years in Bournemouth, and this is a key driver in preventing homelessness, and improving quality of life for so many of our families.\nIf we lose this vote of no confidence it is not me I am worried about, a break will do me the world of good, I’ve given everything I have to this role for the last year and a half. I am worried about those still on our streets, who won’t be helped but hindered, not housed but fined.",

Since my last a lot of bad things have happened, by far the worst of which was my mum, whom many of you reading this will know, passed away. She was my best friend, my angel. She wasn’t really into politics, except when I was running. She didn’t care particularly for the left or right, she only knew to be kind. That is what I’ve always tried to do, though my success rate has never been as high as her’s.\nThe last two months have been a battle, I haven’t taken any leave because I was really not sure I would be able to start again if I stopped. And actually continuing to work has really helped. The support of fellow councillors has been so good, and I am enterally grateful to the members of my group, the cabinet, officers and the whole of the Unity Alliance, along with a number of conservatives who have been really good to me. At her funeral the music we said goodbye to her with was the song her and my dad had their first dance to after they were married ‘Always Look on the Bright Side of Life’, Monty Python’s classic, and that is because she always did. Even when life was jolly rotten, she continued smiling through, and that is what I have to do.\nLast week I sat in front of the Overview and Scrutiny committee presenting my first Housing Revenue Account Budget, it was exactly a month after my Mum’s funeral and getting up to the table to speak was a huge achievement for me. What I presented was a forward thinking paper which set out plans on how we will use HRA funding to deliver more and improved housing, that meets local needs, addresses affordability issues driving the housing crisis, supports measures around tackling homelessness and drives work around the sustainability of the stock ensuring it is fit for purpose for not just now but 50 years time. And whilst getting those words out, felt like climbing Everest barefoot, when I did it felt so good.\nAt the minute I am up and down, and when I am down I am really down, but I think it is very natural. To lose your best friend, the one person who loves you unconditionally is so hard, and it is really just starting to sink in. But I know that mum would want me to be positive, and that she would want me to carry on, working hard, and trying to help improve people’s lives in whatever way possible. Whether that was through building more social rented housing or just having time to chat them to talk through their problems.\nTomorrow would have been her 63rd Birthday, instead of being in the house with her watching channel 5 movies and eating rubbish, I will be at the Homelessness Reduction Board, continuing the collaborative work we have started to bring an end to homelessness, it is what she would have loved me to be doing.\nI want to thank everyone who has supported me throughout. It is really hard of course and it will be for a while, but I’ll get there. As they say when you’re chewing on life’s gristle, Don’t grumble, give a whistle! And this’ll help things turn out for the best.\nDu, Du, Du du du!\nLove you mum x",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_2018_10_24_tea-with-jane/content_54.html": "Before I got elected as a Councillor I wrote an impassioned letter to Dame Jane Goodall, regarding a number of different things, but at the heart of it was my concern about the proposed developments on Bournemouth’s greenbelt land. The greenbelt surrounding the conurbation is currently under great threat by this conservative council, and quite frankly it’s vanity.\nThe council won funding from the Conservative national government to cover the costs of the development, £65 million in total, however the only thing they can spend this money on is a flawed project destined to cause more problems in the long term. The proposals are so flawed in fact the planning officer objected to them and then stepped down from the project. Since they have adjusted their proposals, but they are not proposals to be adjusted but scrapped all together. I have been against the scheme since 2017 when I first heard about it, and shared a platform with Bournemouth East’s MP Tobias Elwood objecting against it during the General Election campaign. Since writing the letter to Jane, there has also been another issue regarding conservation within my own ward. That of Hicks Farm in the beautiful village of Throop. To say it has got my residents talking is an understatement, the consultation recently was lively, and gave a lot of people food for thought. Even though I consider myself to have an open mind on what happens at Hicks Farm, the consensus I felt is that any building work had to be in keeping with the scale and personality of Throop. If the council put in a planning application that doesn’t do this, I will be standing alongside my residents fighting to stop it, as is my duty to them.\nMy letter to Jane was my way of venting against what I saw as injustice, at the time I had no influence, I was thinking about running but hadn’t committed to doing so, but I just care so much about preserving the beauty of this town. It is our greatest asset, and Thoop and Holdenhurst are really jewels in Bournemouth’s crown. I never expected to get a reply from her, let alone the one I received a few months later. One sunny May morning just a couple of days before the FA Cup final, a letter came through the post. I didn’t recognise the handwriting and anticipated another concerned residents correspondence about something the council had failed to do. Instead to my amazement, when I opened it I had the sweetest note from my long standing idol, which is now safely secured in my treasure box. She wanted to meet me. I was excited to say the least, Jane tours the world spreading her message of hope, conservation and sustainability in universities and on theatre stages across the globe, from Bangkok to Baltimore, so finding a time to meet was always going to be difficult. She rarely gets a minute to herself. However after numerous emails back and forth with her secretary, Claire, a couple of weeks ago I received one with a date and an address.\nAnd just like that Dame Jane Goodall was pouring me a cup of tea in her living room, whilst her sister Judy cut me a slice of the most moist gluten free cake you’re ever likely to taste. I honestly felt as though I was in a dream, the word surreal doesn’t even cover it. At first I found it hard to speak, my mouth didn’t seem to want to open and when it did it was saying the most trivial things, here I was with an absolute icon and for one of the few times in my life I was speechless.\nEventually though once we started talking about the important issues of the day, particularly in Bournemouth, I couldn’t stop. She asked about the A338, I explained to her the paradoxical nature of the development, aimed to ease congestion, yet will create, according to the portfolio holder himself, Mike Greene, 2,000 new jobs on an accompanying site built for offices and new business. It is obvious to anyone without their head in the sand that 2,000 new jobs will cause an increase in traffic. I told her about the recent success of saving the Cob Barn, a building of over 500 years old. Yet despite this success, the council will just move their plans to cut into more of the greenbelt we are trying to save. I praised the activism within the area that has been a constant thorn in the council’s side, much of which has been coming from residents in my own ward, the council needs to be scrutinised and they are an important part of that role. Jane was disappointed with what she was hearing, but not surprised, but she told me to keep going, ‘keep doing what you are doing’.\nSometimes in this role it can be demoralising, the politics, the daunting size of the majority this conservative council has, but hearing your hero say you have to keep fighting is something that will stick with me, in this role and in whatever role I’m in come next May, and I always will keep standing up for what I believe is right. As Jane put another log on the fire, and I poured myself another cup of tea, it was my turn to listen, as Jane spoke about her work through her foundation ‘Roots and Shoots’ in Tanzania, and across the world. We talked at length about the problems of the world, Trump, the Paris Climate agreement, about the state of politics in Brazil, the importance of travel. And we ended on a positive note as I told her about the kindness I received throughout the world, especially in Rome. Before we knew it, almost two hours went just like that, Jane had to take her leave to make a conference call, another good fight to fight no doubt. As I left Jane’s house, I really left a different person, filled with hope, with fight, and with understanding of what it is to show humility despite being incredible.\nConserving Bournemouth’s beauty and character are high on my agenda, the A338 improvement scheme will not do this. It is, to all intents and purposes, a vanity project that will cause so many more problems in the long term than it will solve in the short term. Bournemouth was recently named the greenest town in the UK for the second year running, and the council are happy to take the credit for this. But when it comes to conserving the treasured greenbelt around the conurbation they are only too quick to sign off the planning application.\nAs I sign off this post, I want to congratulate those who helped to save the Cob Barn, Jane says ‘keep fighting’, I want to shame the council who over the last two decades have allowed it to deteriorate. And ask why are both the local and national conservative government are so intent on wasting your money?",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_page_9/content_27.html": "I’m nearly four months into my new role as Housing portfolio holder. And I’m loving all of it. Well nearly all of it. I adore being your representative, l love working towards housing more people but I hate being a politician.\nLast month I went over to Finland and was so inspired to hear about the work they were doing in housing, both in dealing with homelessness, but also the issue of affordability, especially in terms of young people like myself. One organisation called NAL was a non-profit that provided high quality, truly affordable housing for those under the age of 30 who needed it. The UK is crying out for such an organisation.\nI also met with Juha Kaakinen the CEO of the Y-foundation. Another non-profit providing Housing First. His foundation has been the biggest factor in making Finland the only country in the EU where homelessness is on the decline. I could have listened to him all day, he had so much experience and knowledge. But there were two main differences I could see between our country and his. The first was the mentality towards housing, perceiving it as a basic human right rather than an investment or commodity. Secondly was that Finland had realised in order to house everyone you need houses, and that those houses have to be truly affordable. The few hours I spent in the company of these groups was invaluable. I left Finland, with books, notes and a number of ideas, feeling energised and optimistic about the future.\nBut that was short lived as I realised the opposition are determined politics gets in the way. Earlier this week I had to go in front of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee to defend a two part report on Project Admiral. Project Admiral referring to a £20 million renovation of 4 council owned tower blocks agreed by the former borough of Poole, to improve fire safety standards, eliminate damp and make it a better place for people to live.\nThe first part was an open report that asked for £750,000 in order to buy back properties from leaseholders who have ill health or experiencing real financial hardships. The second part was exempt to the public for legal reasons, but was around what the leaseholders should pay per the section 20 of their lease.\nI received a rough ride and politics really played its part. Despite being well briefed, knowing I had come to the recommendations that I felt were best, I still came out with a few bruises. In fairness there were traps I shouldn’t have fell for, and bate I should of taken and with time I’m sure I won’t. However the conservative members weren’t there to add value, as they so often claim. If they were they would have suggested an option to take. Instead they just wanted to provide me with a few sleepless nights and they succeeded.\nThat O&S meeting really got me thinking, and that Monday night I really couldn’t sleep, twisting and turning over the arguments and the numerous scenarios put to me around the options in the exempt report. As well as the open one. However what eventually helped me get to sleep was the obvious fact that was staring me in the face the whole time, it’s a fact that’s not changed since I became a councillor. It’s why I am a Councillor.\nI am fundamentally different in my way of thinking to those who posed the arguments to me.\nMy main concerns when considering the options were fairness and how to keep a good relationship with leaseholders, to enable future access to properties when needed and ensuring they uphold their responsibility as Leaseholders. Whilst also minimising the risk of going to tribunal. Despite knowing we have an extremely strong case if brought in front of a judge.\nCertain members at the meeting described two classes when differentiating the leaseholders from those renting. Well I could only see one class. I could only see people who live in the same tower block who all have the same aspiration to live a good life how they want to, and all with their own pressures whether that be financial or health. All of whom will be affected by the works but all of whom will have a better place to live once those works are finished.\nOne member then went on to ask how other council tenants would feel about the money coming out of the HRA to support residents affected. Well speaking as a Council tenant I am fine with that. I understand that not every penny this council spends has to benefit me, and more over I can put myself in the shoes of those leaseholders, most of whom have become property rich but cash poor by trying to get a foot on the ladder, a stake in society, and I can sympathise with them being fronted by such a heavy bill.\nI didn’t come to the decision lightly, no one on the cabinet came to the decision lightly. I joked at the meeting, when posed with various outlandish scenarios that went from one extreme to another that ‘it’s my sword and I’ll fall on it’ well I was wrong, it’s my sword and I’ll raise it. We as a cabinet and an alliance are doing things differently now. And that’s good, in fact it’s great.\nWe are now more transparent and communicating better than any previous administration. One Conservative voting resident of mine asked ‘how come you’re so much better at communicating than the last lot?’ I said it’s because we want to talk to you. Just last week we had residents round the table talking about Hicks Farm with the local MP. That wouldn’t have been forthcoming previously.\nAnd so the next night after not being able to sleep the previous one I took a page out of Cllr David Brown’s book and went to play some of the craziest golf I’ve ever played with a lovely girl I’ve been seeing, I got home and I slept like a baby safe in the knowledge that this alliance cares about people rather than politics.",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_17/content_73.html": "Thanks for joining me! This a new blog from Kieron Wilson Independent Councillor for Throop and Muscliff, giving you an insight into what is happening at your council, as well as addressing the issues that matter in Bournemouth.\nGood company in a journey makes the way seem shorter. — Izaak Walton",
  "https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_/https_bourneindependent_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized_page_11/content_48.html": "In the time I’ve been a councillor the biggest issue that has faced me is what should be done with Hicks Farm. There is a general consensus that something needs to be done. The condition that the council have allowed it deteriorate to over the years is unacceptable, and the number of emails I received in my first few months about its condition reinforced that fact. So when the council brought forward their idea about turning it into a community space I approached it, as I approach everything, with an open mind, understanding that Hicks Farm can’t stay in the state it is in.\nHowever the process that it has undertaken in the last 8 months or so hasn’t been the process that should take place when discussing a community space. Firstly the public consultation only spent three days in Throop itself, whilst the rest of the month it was at the Kingfisher Barn. Which whist I acknowledge there is logistical difficulty in having more time in Throop, you can’t spend so little time in the place where the project will be located. Whilst during the consultation period, the opinions and concerns of residents were belittled and mocked by fellow ward councillors as ‘NIMBYs’ which I found distasteful and not what you should expect from those who are said to represent you. The concerns are valid ones, does Throop have the infrastructure for a community space on a scale that will make the project worthwhile for the council? Will it potentially bring a rise in anti-social behaviour? How many cars are going to be parked in an already congested part of the ward? These are just some of the fair questions and concerns that have been raised by my constituents, and it is our jobs as councillors to address these concerns not deride them.\nHowever this pattern of behaviour is not unusual from my fellow ward councillors, Cllr Clark and the Mayor Borthwick, whom not so long ago mistakenly sent an email to a resident in which they were colluding to keep information away from me. Whilst I understand that for them it is just politics being played out, it is you that has suffered. But that doesn’t matter very much to them. Through this whole process I have been kept in the dark. To my astonishment last week at what could be my last area forum, Cllr Clark revealed that Throop Mill had been sold and was under new ownership. This was a fresh information to me, and I have since sent a number of emails to Cllr Clark asking for the details of the acquisition and the new owner. Still waiting on a reply.\nThen yesterday I learnt of an eviction notice being served to tenants of Hicks Farm, not from a phone call from a councillor, or an email from an officer, but from the post of a very active group in my ward, the Throop Village Conservation Group. This group have been important in enhancing your democracy, whilst I have not agreed with very single post they have written, I have appreciated their tenacity and commitment to a cause they feel strongly about. Unfortunately for me they have been far too often where I hear news first. Despite my constant insistence to be updated, and the number of emails I send out on a regular basis asking what the state of play is on number of issues, I am too often kept in the dark on purpose. Which is why you deserve better councillors.\nI include myself in that, I need to improve, I’ve been doing it a year now, I know a lot but I still have so much more to learn. Which is why in two months on May 2nd, if you are going to vote for me, you have to vote for Lisa Northover as well. Her experience will be invaluable to both me and you, her compassion and intelligence will be an asset to the ward and the town. But it is her honesty and integrity that will be the most valuable qualities, both of which are considerably lacking in my colleges. She is of the same opinion as myself with regards to Hicks Farm. That something needs to be done with it, but it has to be done within keeping of the scale and tradition of Throop Village. If an application goes to planning board that we are not happy with we will fight against it with everything we have."
