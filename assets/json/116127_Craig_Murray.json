He is most often asked to speak on the events related in Murder in Samarkand and on the so-called “War on Terror”, and on the attack on civil liberties in the UK. He also talks on Africa and International Development, and on the future of Russia. He also speaks on a wide range of other other questions drawing on his twenty years experience as a British diplomat.\nCraig is much in demand as a hilarious after dinner speaker.\nCraig regularly speaks to groups both all over the UK, and internationally. He is willing to talk to groups and communities, to universities and schools. For example, in the past year Craig has spoken in 9 countries; to numerous Universities, both as part of faculty teaching and to university societies, to both private and state schools, to conferences, political parties, literary festivals, churches and Muslim gatherings, community associations and to local groups as diverse as Amnesty International and the Women’s Institute.\nCraig asks organisations which are in a position to pay a fee, to pay whatever fee they can afford in line with their normal practice. Over half of his talks are given free to worthwhile groups. In that case the group should pay all travel expenses plus £30 for incidentals.\nA few points:\nIn a meeting Craig will normally expect to speak for at least half an hour, to develop his themes. He does do “Panel” meetings.\nCraig attracts large audiences and would normally expect to talk to at least fifty people. It is therefore sensible to be able to guarantee about thirty before inviting him.\nIn the interests of the environment, Craig travels by public transport. It is helpful if you book the tickets and send them, as we often don’t have time to do this far enough in advance to get cheap deals.\nCraig cannot do budget air travel, for medical reasons. If overnight accommodation is required, he is happy to stay in either home or hotel, but in either case needs an ensuite bathroom.\nIf there is an opportunity for a book signing after the event, we will supply the books unless the event is in a bookshop.\nDo keep reminding us as the date approaches. We are often under a lot of deadline pressure, and there is a danger of an appointment being overlooked, so do not worry about nagging!\nTo invite Craig to speak, email craigmurray1710 AT btinternet DOT com\nDear Ambassador,\nWe are the first Bahraini independent TV channel base here in UK, promoting justice, democracy, human rights, and freedom.

  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2017_05_may-intends-appoint-liam-fox-chancellor/content_8.html": "A week ago an old Whitehall colleague told me that Treasury mandarins expect to be briefing Liam Fox as the new Chancellor should the Tories be re-elected – and they were not much looking forward to the experience. I did not pay much attention until today’s May/Hammond press conference, where it became evident that Hammond’s coat is on the shoogliest of pegs.\nHammond started the day being ripped to shreds by John Humphreys on the Today programme and getting the cost of HS2 radically wrong. But that hardly matters, as it is only when this happens to opposition figures that the mainstream media highlights and constant replays it.\nA much more telling incident happened shortly thereafter when, standing alongside Hammond, May was three times asked directly if Hammond would continue as Chancellor, and she refused to back him, only at the third time of asking giving the most half hearted endorsement. I then realised the information I had been given was good.\nStrangely, it is only the right wing media that has noted Fox’s continuing relationship with Adam Werritty. It was the Spectator which published that Werritty joined Fox on the Commons Terrace for a champagne spree to celebrate the disgraced ex-minister’s return to office. I was told by a SNP MP who witnessed it and used the phrase “brass neck”. But only the Spectator reported it, and only the Times has said that the two remain close. They reported last year that Werritty is living in Dolphin Square (I know, let’s not go there).\nI have an irresistible image of what life is going to be like inside the Treasury, should Fox and Werritty have the run of it.\nOf course Werritty opened a private health company when Fox was Health Secretary and a defence consultancy business when Fox was Minister of Defence. If Fox becomes Chancellor, I presume he gets to open a bank!\nBut on a more serious note, the prospect of Fox becoming Chancellor is truly alarming. The hard right links he forged through the now defunct Atlantic Bridge to the American Legislative Exchange Council and the Heritage Foundation give him direct access into the heart of the Trump administration, and align him with the nastiest millionaires and hedge fund managers, with the funders of climate change denial and with those who wish to abolish literally all workers’ rights and consumer protections. This article by George Monbiot is rather dense, but it is essential reading. And terrifying.\nFox appears to be confined in a locked cupboard for the duration of the election campaign. Doubtless he is waiting, like a child on Christmas Eve, to come bursting out and claim his prize once it is over.\nComic Cuts on both sides of the Atlantic it would appear. Here’s a familiar face.\n‘Former FBI boss to lead Russia inquiry\nRobert Mueller is a former prosecutor who served as FBI chief from 2001 to 2013. He has been named as a special prosecutor to oversee a probe into Russia’s alleged interference in the US election.\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said it was “in the public interest” to bring an outsider in to oversee the investigation.\nCalls for a special prosecutor have mounted since President Donald Trump fired the FBI director last week.’\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39957358\nWhy the FBI? Isn’t there now a new agency for countering foreign disinformation and propaganda: The CIA&Response required to have been set up about now.\nOnly one comment required, “Lockerbie”. Scotland’s eternal shame, and that includes the Scottish Government.\nhttp://spookterror.blogspot.co.uk/2008/08/lockerbie-mueller-thurman-bollier.html\nMonbiot is an idiot. He writes an entire article on Dark Money, and fails to mention the Clinton Foundation. I even did a search with the word ‘Cinton’. Results: zero.\nThe Clinton Foundation is an utter cess-pit of corruption, pay for play, drug money, Saudi money, and (allegedly) even worse. These supposed leftist writers who have gone insane over Trump are pathetic, miserable, globalist quislings. They also don’t appear to know what a ‘fascist’ is, which is unforgivable.\nAlso, this:\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/05/16/hillary-clintons-onward-together-open-to-dark-money-she-lambasted-during-campaign/\nBrietbart don’t mention Trump’s Dark Money, but it’s Brietbart, who are openly biased towards Trump. Monbiot is meant to be a journalist. Perhaps he can answer why he doesn’t mention The Clinton Foundation? It is, after all, relevant to his article.\nLordy, I’m defending Trump again. I assure you, I really don’t want to. I’d much prefer The Left shows some balls, and disavow Clinton.\nI even spelled ‘Clinton’ correctly, when I did the search.\nI don’t doubt for a minute that the Clintons’ operations are deeply dodgy. But I’d guess that Monbiot would be in a lot of trouble if he published allegations he couldn’t substantiate. In Trump’s case, the business connections and the money are far more public than they are in the Clintons’. He doesn’t have the reliatively opaque facade of charitable interests to hide behind, and he’s not a paid stooge of global finance, whatever other crimes he is guilty of, some of which are on public record too.\nI’ve lost all respect for Mombiot. First he joins the calls for war on Syria and now this. Either the man is truly an idiot or he is a coward who values his status as an establishment journalist more than he values facts and the pursuit of truth.\nThe Guardian under Viner’s helm may as well be run from Democratic Party HQ. The collective worship of Clinton at that rag knows no bounds and is truly cringeworthy. Monbiot was the token soft left-winger but he’s now jumped the shark completely. The comments section there used to be lively…that too has come to an end.\nIt does seem we are in the twilight days of democracy but what is even more disconcerting is how easily people swallow the misinformation peddled by the western media, which has become the official propaganda service of the neoliberal establishment. There are so many contradictory and morally indefensible positions endorsed and put forward by the mainstream media….yet nary a peep of criticism emerges from the liberal side of the spectrum.\nThe Trump spectacle has pushed people to reveal where they stand politically and the patterns that have been revealed are not particularly encouraging. The liberal so-called left loudly calls for a renewed Cold War with Russia and the destruction of nations whose only “crime” is their desire to remain sovereign and it approves of a capitalism that Thatcher and Reagan could support.\nBut perhaps the most insane, and morally bankrupt, development recently is the liberal position that slurs against homosexuals, “trans-people”, women and ethnic minorities constitute the worst transgression imaginable. Destroying countries via invasion, bombing and using gangs of mercenary thugs and murderous religious zealots as a proxy is just, moral and civilised but questioning the soundness of limitless gender fluidity and men and women who have sex change operations must be loudly opposed! Along the same lines…how dare Trump prevent people from select Muslim majority nations enter the United States…he should be civilised like Obama and Hillary and their NATO flunkies and kill them with high explosives instead.\n/rant\n“Middle-class pensioners to lose benefits under Tory plan to fund social care ” – Telegraph\nTories currently committing Kamikaze displaying the fact that they know absolutely nothing about society nor economics.

The perceived unfairness of that would be mitigated by progressive taxation to pay for the services. To each according to his/her need, from each according to his/her ability. With a truly progressive tax system – taxation by proportion of income rather than incrementally (and arbitrarily) staged levies on absolute amount – this would work rather well. The better off would be free to donate their unwanted benefits to charity, as they are now.\nBa’al\n“With a truly progressive tax system – taxation by proportion of income rather than incrementally (and arbitrarily) staged levies on absolute amount”\n________________\nTrying to understand that – the “taxation by proportion of income” bit. Could you explain?\nI worded it poorly. Perhaps it would be simpler to outline a possible methodology. At present taxation is by bands which cut in at widely separated thresholds. It would obviously be fairer to simply tax everyone by the same percentage, and do away with the bands. There is an obvious downside to this. 1. Any single rate of tax sufficient to obtain the desired income would impact the lower-earner unfairly. He needs a higher proportion of his income simply to remain viable OTOH, this will appeal to fat cats since the more even spread of tax income could well lower the rate they pay.\nAt the lower end, then, there needs to be a taper. At the upper end, there needs to be some constraint so as not to imperil investment in the UK (further). A single rate is not practicable. That is why we are still using an approach dating from the days of quill pens and parchment. But suppose the rate of taxation were simply a function of income? And suppose that function were a simple algebraic one. Suppose A earns the threshold income of (say) £10,000 and B earns £11,000. Currently they’re in the same basic tax band and pay 20%. Under Komodonomics, A would pay nothing, being at the threshold. B would pay f(x-t) * x. Here x is his gross income and t is the threshold income. (f(x) is shorthand for ‘do what you like to the contents of the bracket’)\nNo bands, no steps, just a smooth curve corresponding to whatever the treasury beancounters decide the function f to be. And, nowadays, it’s as easy to calculate for the individual as, say pounds to kilograms, for which there are I guess 100,000 conversion sites on the internet. Plug your wage in, select UK tax, hit enter, and you’ll know.\nNot all functions go up and up indefinitely. Some achieve equilibrium at a certain value and rise no further. One such is the logistic equation, and this would be handy if you didn’t want to disincentivise high earners with high rates of tax, As I am pretty sure you wouldn’t, Habb.\nFinally, this could all be very comfortably accommodated in a system including negative income tax, which is currently getting some interest (no pun) as a partial or full alternative to state-funded benefits. The function for this would be the same function as before with different weighting : g(t-x), and would calculate the payment to the lowest-earner. Another plus here. The top-end taper on a logistical function would ensure that a maximum payment existed. This would relate to current DSS out-of work benefits, which would then be unneccessary. And all the evil scrounging chav benefit scrounger (we are all instructed to despise) has to do is to do some work, which will be negatively taxed until he reaches the threshold, and wihich will be no business of the DSS/Serco/anyone but HMRC.\nWell, you asked.\nI like it, anyway.\nErratum. For ‘logistic equation’ above please read ‘logistic function’ ( or ‘sigmoid function’ may be more familiar). There is a difference.\ntriple lock and inflation rises are abandoned for a straight 2.5% rise in pension, the Conservatives are taking their gloves off now and starting to whittle away and are patching up what they perceive is possible.\nThey can’t be trusted not to cut the number of soldiers, down from 74K to 69K, their defence strategy looks increasingly like they are doing the US some favours by buying some of the worst crap available, F 35’s and trident are just two of them.\nTheir education policy is a runaway train of private education Ceo’s paying themselves whatever they like, a black hole created by them that is finished in Sweden disgraced and unworkable.\nAdd to that their aspirations of ‘getting the best possible deal from the Brexit negotiations’, which turned into ‘walking away and talk of a hard brexit’, never mentioned in any of the referendum literature. Their plan is to wreck the EU whilst sidestepping it and wrecking any of the negotiations coming up, just as they have sidestepped the decision they took to support an EU MPCC, news that did not make this country, because it would have made BoJo and Fallon look like the limp d..s they really are.\n‘She has quite a job to do’. Mission impossible, I’d say. Still-it is not unknown for turkeys to vote for Christmas, and much more common for sheep to vote for sheepskin jackets.\nhttp://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2017/05/16/labour-has-delivered-a-good-manifesto-for-the-uk/\nNo chance of this from Foxity….\nF(Fox)S…looks like a good analysis to me.\nAnd I guess IDS will rise from the political grave, too.

  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2025_01_israeli-atrocities-in-lebanon/content_2.html": "Yesterday, not only did Israel fail to evacuate its army from Southern Lebanon as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, Israel also shot over 130 Lebanese civilians attempting to return home in accordance with the deal, killing 23 and wounding 109 (of whom some are in critical condition).\nThis included a 12 year old boy wounded in the neck in Kfarkela, standing right next to my local producer Mahmood. I was twenty yards away and on my way to them. Four were killed in Kfarkela and overnight the Israeli army demolished numerous homes there in “punishment”.\nOver 100 people shot by the Israelis today in Lebanons, with 11 dead. A 12 year old boy was wounded by Israeli fire standing right next to one of my team, just before this. pic.twitter.com/wsMp7XCiKu\n— Craig Murray (@CraigMurrayOrg) January 26, 2025\nApart from one Lebanese army solider, all of the dead were civilians simply attempting to return to their homes. At least five of the dead were children. All were shot, not bombed.\nIsrael’s excuse for not withdrawing is that the ceasefire agreement is not fulfilled, in that Hezbollah have not been disarmed south of the Litani river, and that the Lebanese army has not assumed control.\nI have spent every waking hour of three days travelling the entire southern border (remember Lebanon is a very small country; the entire country is the area of Yorkshire or Connecticut – the demarcated border region is much smaller still).\nI can guarantee the Lebanese army is fully in control of the area. There are army checkpoints at every major crossroads and town entrance and at every track into the hills. What is more to the point, I saw nobody at all except for the Lebanese army carrying weapons.\nHezbollah are a significant political presence still – they are the largest political party in Lebanon – but they are not carrying arms in the ceasefire zone south of the Litani. Furthermore the Lebanese army has indeed occupied and taken over or dismantled Hezbollah’s military positions in this zone. They have confiscated over 50 arms caches.\nThe only areas of Southern Lebanon not under the control of the Lebanese armed forces are those areas occupied by the Israeli army.\nThe role of the Lebanese army is extremely dubious, but 100% in Israel’s favour. The Lebanese army is fully under US control. Literally, 50% of the salary of every single Lebanese soldier is directly paid by the US Government.\nYesterday the Lebanese army simply watched the Israeli army massacre Lebanese civilians. If the Lebanese army was protecting anybody yesterday, it was protecting the Israeli Defence Force.\nSill more extraordinary, the new Lebanese Government failed to protest at the Israeli failure to withdraw, and the Trump administration has subsequently announced that Lebanon has agreed to extend the withdrawal deadline until 18 February.\nIn fact neither Israel nor the USA ever had the slightest intention of IDF withdrawal. Israel has demolished more than 2,000 Lebanese homes during the ceasefire period, about half of them in towns and villages which Israel was unable to reach during the fighting but has occupied during the ceasefire.\nI visited the city of Khiam yesterday and was simply stunned by the scale of devastation. Over 1,000 homes have been demolished by Israel in Khiam.\nAmongst all the debris, I managed to track down the piano of Dr Julia Ali, which became an internet meme after she posted video of herself playing it in her beautiful home, and then Israeli soldiers mocking it after the home was devastated.\nThe house is an interesting case study. The Zionist propagandists replied to the internet videos by stating that there was a Hezbollah rocket installation in the garden. I searched extensively and found absolutely no evidence this was anything except a civilian home. There were no signs of anything unusual in the garden.\nThe house was not bombed – it was part demolished with explosives, shot up and set on fire, after being used as an Israeli barracks. The surviving furniture was ripped up with knives, and the mirrors, chandeliers, piano, porcelain and crystal all smashed.\nWomen’s clothing was strewn all around, as were dolls. Large obscene drawings and Hebrew graffiti were painted on the walls. In a room used for meals, used paper plates were all upside down on the floor and had been used to smear the food around. The floor was littered with food tins, used plastic cutlery, empty drink bottles and human excrement, again deliberately smeared around.\nThroughout the building and garden were scattered numerous ammunition boxes, from small arms to tank rounds. All of it was USA manufactured.\nAll of the television sets, satellite receivers, music systems and kitchen electricals were ripped out, as was the generator set.\nI went to the neighbouring villa, where a lady owner was salvaging from the wreckage with her son in law. Again, all of the electrical equipment and the generator set had been taken. Also disappeared was jewellery, a highly valuable collection of antique rugs, and significant paintings. None of this was among the rubble.\nWe investigated further in the area and could find no instance of any TVs or valuables, or their remnants, being discovered in the rubble. We also found instances of shops, particularly a designer clothes shop and a phone shop, whose entire content had been looted.\nA soldier cannot put a generator set or an antique carpet in his backpack. This industrial scale of looting has to be officially sanctioned by the IDF and involve military transport vehicles, or vehicles requisitioned by the military.\nIt may not compare to the murder of children, but is itself a war crime. The western MSM, which made a huge noise about Russian looting in Ukraine, has never mentioned this massive Israeli looting.\nThe Ceasefire Agreement was a disgrace that was bound to lead to this conclusion. The notion that its monitors, France and the United States, are in any sense neutral is laughable. Israel has no intention whatsoever of withdrawing from Southern Lebanon and continues daily destruction of Lebanese homes while constructing at least five fortified military bases.\nWhat I still find astonishing is that new Lebanese President Aoun and Prime Minister Mikati have agreed to extend the Israeli occupation on these obviously false pretexts. Israel has committed over 120 documented violations of the ceasefire. Hezbollah has committed one, in early December, in response to multiple Israeli attacks on civilians.\nHezbollah is in real danger of looking a busted flush. It agreed to disarm in the ceasefire deal, which would leave Israel able to annex Southern Lebanon with no serious opposition on the ground. It does seem that Hezbollah’s war losses and the assassination of its leadership cadre has left it incapable of any significant military response to extended Israeli occupation. Its response to yesterday’s massacre has been only rhetoric.\nAs of today, Israel appears well set to consolidate its extension of Greater Israel into both Southern Lebanon and Southern Syria, with the active complicity of US backed governments in both Beirut and Damascus.\nIn the long term, I believe the atrocities of Israel will be rejected by the people of the region and bring about its downfall. But currently it is Netanyahu and Trump who are smiling.\n———————————–\nWe have no finance at all for this work except our readers.

They don’t really need the goods or the money, surely.\nDemonstrating their contempt for their victims!!!!\nYou are applying your behavioural norms to a different kind of animal. This is one of the reasons the IDF can operate the way it does in plain sight: ordinary decent people cannot believe it is possible. And you could be partially correct: the IDF soldiers may be looting more from hatred and spite, dumping most the items later.\nEven less believable seems to be the idea that the it is planned, orchestrated, and systematic. If you started instead with a question like “Why do IDF snipers deliberately target children”, and viewed the available evidence, eyewitness testimony presented to UK Parliament, and other citations from NGOs and charities like Amnesty, you might think differently.

And we ask that the Home Office commission an independent investigation into the policing of the protest.”\nOver 50 cross-party MPs and Peers from six parliamentary groups have signed a letter to the Home Secretary, calling for an independent inquiry into the policing of the Palestine demonstration on 18 January.\nhttps://labouroutlook.org/2025/01/30/50-parliamentarians-write-to-home-secretary-calling-for-independent-inquiry-into-policing-of-palestine-protest/\nJust did a search to see if any of the MSM have covered it, and it doesn’t look as if they have. And given that Stop the War posted about it six hours ago at the time of typing (and Middle East Monitor posted about it EIGHT hours ago), they’ve had plenty of time to do so if they were going to. The Morning Star posted about it an hour or so ago, and Anadolu Ajansı also posted about it earlier today.\nAnd I’m pretty sure that none of the MSM have mentioned at any time in the past fifteen/sixteen months that there’s a large Jewish bloc on the national demos.\nHmm, I wonder why not!\nWhile it is hard to discern how serious Trump is, he raised the idea to ethnically cleanse palestinians out of Gaza into predominantly Jordan and Egypt, while these nations have, albeit meekly, rejected this idea, is not there a great risk they will succumb? Judging how quickly Colombia cried uncle after Trump threatened with tariffs, is not the same procedure inveitable on this issue too?\nGazans also predominately seems to be support Hamas (Muslim Brotherood), the Brotherhood is the biggest oppositional political party in both Egypt and Jordan (and elsewhere in the arab region) and a big reason why the leadership of Egypt/Jordan refuse to give real actual help to Gaza.\nThe Donald is ALWAYS serious whenever his interests are at stake. In the case of Palestine, as both his son-in-law Jared and his alter ego Elon have candidly stated, “what a beautiful beachfront for real estate” Gaza will make. And make no mistake: the West Bank also has all the resources to host perfectly landscaped golf courses, matching those in Scotland.\nSo whoever Gazans support is nowadays totally irrelevant. By all means, they are obliviously far less capable of resisting to pressure than Colombia.\nThe ethnic cleansing is sadly already happening…",

Rather the security services wish it only to look at individual cases like Binyam Mohammed and assess compensation for them. The cover-up that these individual cases were accidents would be maintained.\nI have now obtained under the Freedom of Information Act the final documents in the Tashkent series. These show beyond doubt that there was an official policy of obtaining intelligence through torture. I was, to the best of my knowledge, the only senior civil servant to enter a written objection to the policy of complicity with torture.\nThe picture built up by these documents is overwhelming and undeniable evidence of a policy of complicity in torture, even despite the censorship by government. The censorship has removed all mentions of the role of the CIA in procuring the torture intelligence from the Uzbek security services, and passing it on to MI6. Protection of the CIA appears to be the primary aim of the censor.\nI set out below transcripts of the documents with a link to each document beneath.\nCENSORED\nCENSORED\nFM TASHKENT\nTO IMMEDIATE FCO\nTELNO 147\nOF 170345Z DECEMBER 02\nINFO IMMEDIATE UKMIS NEW YORK, UKMIS GENEVA, UKDEL VIENNA\nFOR PUS AND MICHAEL WOOD\nFOR HEADS OF MISSION UKMIS NEW YORK, UKMIS GENEVA AND UKDEL VIENNA\nSUBJECT: RECEIPT OF INTELLIGENCE PROBABLY OBTAINED UNDER TORTURE\n1.

Thank you for TUR. I apologise for not findng you at the Leadership Conference, but I had decided to drop this. What seemed to be a major concern seemed not a problem to others, and this caused me some self-doubt.\n2. However I see that the Economist of 11 to 17 January devoted its front cover, a full page editorial and four whole pages of article to precisely the question I had raised. Reading a newspaper on the flight back here 12 January, I was astonished to find two pages of the Sunday Mail devoted to exactly the same concerns. Back in Tashkent, I find Human Rights Watch urging the US government not to extradite Uzbek detainees from Afghanistan back to Uzbekistan on the same grounds. All of which emboldens me to think I am in good company in my concern. These stories all quote US sources as indicating that the CIA is accepting intelligence obtained under torture by “allied” governments. As I already explained, I too believe that to be most probably true here.\n3. CENSORED\nYou accept that torture of detainees in Uzbekistan is widespread. Redacted.\n4. CENSORED.\nI can give you mounds of evidence on torture by the Uzbek security services, and I have et victims and their families.

I am not sure that a wilful blindness to how material is obtained would be found a valid defence in law to the accusation of having received material obtained under torture. My understanding is that receiving such material would be both a crime in UK domestic law and contrary to international law. Is this true? I would like a direct answer on this.\n7. CENSORED.\n8.

Michael Wood, Matthew Kidd and I had a meeting with Craig Murray (Me, British Ambassador to Tashkent) to discuss his telegram (Tashkent Telno Misc 01).\nCENSORED\nI said you had asked me to discuss this with Craig personally in view of the sensitive nature of the issues involved.\n2. Craig said his concerns had been prompted by a presentation to the Uzbek authorities by Professor Korff (OSCE Adviser) on the UN Convention on Torture. Craig said that his understanding was that it was also an offence under the Convention to receive or to possess information obtained under torture. He asked for clarification on this. Michael Wood replied that he did not believe that possession of information was in itself an offence, but undertook to re-read the Convention and to ensure that Craig had a reply on this particular point.\n3. I gave Craig a copy of your revised draft telegram (attached) and took him through this. I said that he was right to raise with you and Ministers (Jack Straw) his concerns about important legal and moral issues. We took these very seriously and gave a great deal of thought to such issues ourselves. There were difficult ethical and moral issues involved and at times difficult judgements had to be made weighing one clutch of “moral issues” against another. It was not always easy for people in post (embassies) to see and appreciate the broader picture, eg piecing together intelligence material from different sources in the global fight against terrorism. But that did not mean we took their concerns any less lightly.\n4. CENSORED\n5. After Michael Wood and Matthew Kidd had left, Craig and I had a general discussion about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan and the difficulties of pushing for a Resolution in Geneva, which we both agreed was important.\nCENSORED\nCONCLUSION\n6. In conclusion, Craig said that he was grateful for the decision to discuss these issues with me personally. At the end of the day he accepted, as a public servant, that these were decisions for Ministers to take, whether he agreed with them or not. If it ever reached the stage where he could not accept such a decision, then the right thing to do would be to request a move. But he was certainly not there yet. He had fed in his views. You and Ministers had decided how to handle this question. He accepted that and would now go back to Tashkent and “Get on with the job”.\n7. I think it was right to see him. I am not sure this is the end of the issue (or correspondence), but it was a frank and amicable discussion and Craig appears to be making efforts to balance his work on human rights with other FCO objectives. We shall, of course, be reviewing these again once he has produced his post objectives for the upcoming year.\nSigned\nLinda Duffield\nDirector Wider Europe\nView Document\nLinda Duffield\nUZBEKISTAN\nLast night the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) read a copy of your minute of 10 March reporting your conversation (in the company of Michael Wood and Matthew Kidd) with Craig Murray.\nThe Foreign Secretary agrees with the PUS that you handled this very well.

Your record of our meeting with HMA Tashkent recorded that Craig had said that his understanding was that it was also an offence under the Convention to receive or possess information obtained under torture. I said that I did not believe that this was the case, but undertook to re-read the Convention.\n2. I have done so. There is nothing in the Convention to this effect. The nearest thing is article 15 which provides:\n“Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made”.\n3. This does not create any offence. I woud expect that under UK law any statement established to have been made as a result of torture would not be admissible as evidence.\nSigned M C Wood\nLegal Adviser\nView Document\nNobody can, on a critical reading through the above documents, doubt that there was a deliberate and considered UK government policy of receiving intelligence from torture, and that it had the support of Jack Straw.\nThe large scale censorship of the documents does not succeed in obscuring this. My favourite bit of censorship is from para 5 of my first telegram above:\n“Two thoughts occur. CENSORED”\nQuite right, of course. There is nothing so dangerous as one of my thoughts, but two?

Unfortunately.\nThis is an excellent, but terribly heart-rending interview with Chris Hedges and Fransesca Alabese discussing her Genocide Report.\nJackFat Jon\nYes that is a factor, I also assume the hatred and the traits of a psychopathy for Netanyahu started earlier already in childhood. Netanyahu’s father Benizon Netanyahu was an ardent “revisionist” zionist – that is, someone that value racism, strength, violence, right-wing hawkishness over diplomacy to expand Israel’s borders.\nThe so called “Revisionist zionists” started a party, Herut, that Eistein, Hannah Arendt and others blasted as fascists. Later on Herut became the party of Likud.\nIn his autobiographical monstrosity, Bibi, My Story, which is part self-aggrandisement, part propaganda and part fascist manifesto, Netanyahu dedicates a chapter to his late father, Benzion. He boasts of his record as editor of a publication aptly named Hayarden (The Jordan), and as a leading voice in the militant revisionist movement which insisted upon the Jewish right to sovereignty over the whole of historic Palestine. Revisionist fighters, who eventually founded Likud’s predecessor Herut, were infamous for their terrorist operations before and during the 1948 war of independence.\nThat year, a number of leading Jewish voices, including Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt and others, described the Herut Party in a public statement published in the New York Times newspaper as a “political party closely akin in its organisation, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to Nazi and Fascist parties”.\nLike father like son. As preached by his father’s revisionist guru Vladimir Jabotinsky in his infamous 1923 essay, The Iron Wall, Netanyahu also believes that Zionism must use military force to persuade the Palestinian Arabs to give up their rights to their homeland.\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/12/21/netanyahu-is-the-godfather-of-modern-israeli-fascism\nSome of these people hailed Mussolini and even Hitler.\nWords That Can’t Be RetractedBefore the Likud came to power in 1977, Abba Ahimeir was not considered worthy of commemoration, on the grounds that he praised not only Mussolini, but Hitler too.\nRest assured, Netanyahu have been conditioned in fascist values since childhood. That is why he is so cocksure of himself and his perverted worldview, these views, values is the only thing he know.\nShibbolethIn my second post on this topic i suggested that you all stop paying income tax to force governments to comply with international and humanitarian law – and to stop funding war.

Be advised that I have discharged the entirety of this alleged unlawful debt by depositing it into a Conditional Revocable Trust, wherein you are designated the Primary Beneficiary. This sum shall be made available to you within a period of fourteen (14) days, contingent upon the provision of irrefutable proof that the demand is lawful and that the following five conditions of the said Trust have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of my trustee.\nConditions of the Trust\nYou are required to furnish proof that a court of competent jurisdiction has adjudicated and ruled that:\n1. Exclusion from Criminal Offences:\nAll taxes, levies, and transfers of money or property to Her Majesty’s Government, public officials, Crown agents, and taxpayers (including tax collectors in both business and government such as yourself and your colleagues) are expressly excluded by law from the criminal offences enumerated in sections 15 through 19 of the Terrorism Act 2000, section 52 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001, and article 2 of the International Criminal Court (Scotland) Act 2001.Nota Bene: It is my understanding, as a matter of law, that the criminal offences under the aforementioned Acts of Parliament take precedence over all taxation and public finance legislation. These statutes apply to all Members of Parliament, Peers of the Realm, public officials at all levels of government (national, regional, and local), members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces, and all law enforcement officers (including, but not limited to, judges, police, lawyers, court officials, and bailiffs), as well as tax collectors, company directors, accountants, business managers, and every adult taxpayer resident within the United Kingdom.\n2. Termination of Unlawful Acts of War and Genocide:\nThe United Kingdom’s involvement in the criminal wars and military and medical genocides, as detailed in paragraphs 2 through 4 of the attached Deed of Trust, has been explicitly terminated. Furthermore, new laws, rules, procedures, and protocols have been implemented to guarantee that no elected or appointed Minister of State, Crown agent, or public official within the United Kingdom can again violate or breach domestic and international laws governing warfare and peace.3. Commencement of Criminal Proceedings:\nCriminal proceedings have commenced against no fewer than one thousand (1000) United Kingdom leaders and tax collectors responsible for initiating, financing, or supporting the eight (8) illegal wars and ten (10) military and medical genocides that, since 2001, have resulted in no fewer than five million (5M) serious injuries and two and a half million (2.5M) deaths of innocent civilians, none of whom had the opportunity to defend themselves before a court of law.4. Compliance with International Law:\nEvery Member of Parliament, Peer, and public official within the United Kingdom is acting in full compliance with the United Nations Charter, the Nuremberg Code, and the Declaration on Principles of International Law.5. Immunity from Prosecution:\nI am guaranteed, both now and in perpetuity, full immunity from prosecution in respect of any and all alleged offences arising from the payment of monies to Her Majesty’s Government.Failure to Meet Conditions\nShould you fail to provide incontrovertible evidence satisfying the aforementioned conditions by no later than 1 January 2025, your claim to the aforementioned sum will be nullified, on the grounds that the funds are likely to be used for criminal purposes. In such a case, the monies held in Trust shall be transferred to the Secondary Beneficiary as stipulated in the attached Deed of Trust.\nClarification on the Use of Public Funds\nThe assertion made by public authorities that no public monies are utilised for purposes of terrorism or war is patently false. As stated on Her Majesty’s Government’s own website: “The Consolidated Fund (CF) was first established in 1787 as ‘one fund into which shall flow every stream of public revenue and from which shall come the supply for every service.”\nMy Position on War Crimes and Genocide\nUnder no circumstances, as delineated in the attached Deed of Trust, will I, under any condition, participate in the funding of mass murders, military, or medical genocides, which have injured and claimed the lives of millions of innocent men, women, and children in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, Palestine, Lebanon, and indeed Britain, since the year 2001.\nYour Legal Obligations under International Law\nIt is imperative to highlight that you, your colleagues, and every resident of the United Kingdom are bound by the Nuremberg Judgement and the statutory provisions enumerated in Condition (1). You are under a legal obligation to cease and desist from following government orders when such orders are manifestly illegal. The use of taxpayers’ money to fund war, mass murder, and genocide is manifestly and unequivocally illegal under both domestic and international law.\nNow that you are fully aware of the fact that His Majesty’s Government utilises taxation revenues for the criminal purposes of war, terrorism, mass murder, and genocide, you, as a tax collector and taxpayer, are legally and lawfully bound to refuse to comply with such governmental directives. Furthermore, should you persist in following such orders and continue to remit funds (in the form of taxes) to Her Majesty’s Government, you may be held personally liable under criminal law and subject to arrest, trial, conviction, and imprisonment, alongside political, civil, judicial, and military leaders, for the offences of fundraising for purposes of terrorism and conduct ancillary to genocide.\nReporting of Criminal Conduct\nIn the event that you or any of your colleagues continue to transfer monies (taxes) to Her Majesty’s Government in contravention of sections 15, 16, and 17 of the Terrorism Act 2000, my trustee is compelled, by virtue of section 19 of the Act, to report you and/or your superiors to a police constable for the commission of a criminal offence. Accordingly, I urge you and your superiors to familiarise yourself with, uphold, and enforce the laws of war and peace, as your legal duty demands.\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]ShibbolethI think it’s quite a neat idea, but would like your view please? I was enlightened recently by an HMRC inspector who claimed the same lacuna has been exploited by many individuals who use the off-shore trust schemes regularly for tax purposes. The UK deposits will normally attract income tax, but by using a Conditional Revocable Trust you avoid paying the sum as HMRC and the government cannot make any counter claim – especially after recent events in Gaza and Ukraine.\nIf enough people took the same action it would force governments to change policy. It isn’t fanciful – it’s your legal and moral responsibility. It doesn’t involve demonstrations, violence or damage. Just your laptop, printer and email.\nWhat say you?\nShibbolethNo? Och well, I’ll just finish countersinking the nails in the baseball bat and wait for the zombies then.\nmichael nortonyou are barking at the walls, nobody is interested.\nShibbolethI think that’s a fairly common view about most things these days, Michael. Few care enough about ecocide or genocide, corruption or injustice, to take any meaningful action. But I’ll simply recommend the above in the hope that one or two may give it further consideration – not least as it’s a perfectly legal mechanism, even though it doesn’t really constrain government spending – especially in the UK where we operate a fiat currency and create sterling by simple keystrokes. But of course, that would create an interesting dilemma for government..\nBut imagine if you will, that such a lacuna was exploited by the masses and the tax revenues plummeted as a result. The markets would have the skitters and the City would be in meltdown within weeks. The government would be paralysed – especially if the tax protest was predicated on a series of conditions (as above) that meant an end to all military exports and the unequivocal support for the Zionist regime in Israel.\nWould it not be worth a try? I wonder what Ed would think?\nJackI saw your question but unfortunately I have no good answer to it.\nYes that is the sad truth, too few people care about the genocidal regime of Israel.\nIn my view there need to be state actors that take care of this from now on. There have been demonstrations throughout the west for 400+ days now, but governments, media do not listen – instead becoming more fanatic, more pro-israel! It would be great if rejecting paying taxes to pressure politicians, but again will the power in charge listen?\nIn my view, only the arab populations – where the negative view against Israel is somewhere between 80-100% – could do anything by now, they need to put maximum pressure on their leaders. They should bring these corrupt leaders down by mass-protests just like during “Arab Spring”. Only them could change the situation by now.ShibbolethI agree, Jack – but temper any hope of Arab leaders taking a stance against Israeli/US hegemony, especially following Trump’s election last week. Reading Craig Murray’s latest post affirms that view. Where is the Lebanese army defending its people rather than Hezbolla? Palestine doesn’t have an army so they rely on Hamas, which is rather like Britain relying on the Home Guard in WWII. Asymmetrical warfare without restraint.\nI sometimes wonder if there’s an asteroid on the way which will decimate the planet and only the elite and political leaders know. Or perhaps another engineered virus to decimate the global population? Because what we are witnessing now is madness; a total disregard for humanity’s prospects of living in a peaceful, hospitable world, without any care of where it will ultimately lead.\nJackYes the arab leaders appeasement of Israel just make Israel more emboldened. Absurd that they – the arab world – cannot put up a resistance against this rotten regime.\nSpeaking on evil. The evilness of Israel was in full display in Amsterdam. I think the events there really summed up the evilness by this regime.\nSo already on the airport from Tel Aviv to Amsterdam the israelis chanted racist songs and even cheered that palestinian children are killed:\nMaccabi Tel Aviv hooligans chanting anti-Arab chants at Tel Aviv airport\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbFiWwY6dYw\nAnd then when they got to Amsterdam, as guests, they kept chanting these racist songs, started attack pro-palestinians and pull down palestinian flags all over.\nWhen the football game held 1 silent minute, the same israelis made noise:\nIsraeli fans disrupt 1 minute’s silence for Valencia flood victims\nhttps://www.instagram.com/middleeastmonitor/reel/DCHTZ_tJUIV/\nI mean who does this? It is like they lack common, human decency, like they have no red lines for anything. They believe they are the Herrenvolk and could do anything they want. Everything is permissible.\nI cannot come up with another population that act like this.Also the appeasement for this behavior is also something else, which in turn just embolden the israelis to become even more evil, more depraved.\nIf any hooligans from a western state would act like this the government of that nation would condemn them, they would distance themselves from their sick behavior, but the response by the israeli regime have been nothing but support!\nPlus, if any other hooligans spread racism, made noise during commemoration/silent minutes, they would also get fines from UEFA/FIFA etc but when the israelis do it there is zero reaction!It almost look like a grand conspiracy going on in the west where the elite/media/politicians are all on the board of accepting, supporting whatever Israel or israelis do.\nShibbolethI don’t understand a) why Israel is allowed to participate in any international sporting or media contest. Russia is banned from everything – why not Israel. b) Notwithstanding the above, why were their fans allowed to travel? Surely someone in the Dutch Police or UEFA or FIFA would have foreseen trouble. In any other game with the potential for violence, the away fans are not permitted tickets or any travel near the match. How was this allowed to happen?\nAnd given the behaviour of some of the Israeli fans on the night before the match and on Thursday too – what did they expect in a city with a significant Arab population and many others with pro Palestinian anti Zionist views? Sausage rolls and Bovril? I’m only sorry it was Ajax and not Celtic the Israelis were playing. Netanyahu would have another hostage situation to deal with.\nJackExactly, what did they expect to happen? It is like if pro-genocide/nazi germans hooligans travelling around europe in 40s chanting racist songs and then cry like a baby about racism when people chase down in the streets!?\nBut what to expect, they live in their supremacist bubble in Israel and travel to one of the most multicultural state on earth and obviously their small racist minds cannot handle that.It seems that there is no wonder that israeli tourists often top lists of the most rude, obnoxious, entitled tourists there is.\nShibbolethI can see most Israelis being asked and challenged on their views everywhere in the near future. If they are zionists or IDF soldiers or just some racist thugs, I’d hope they would be robustly challenged and invited to return to Israel. This government in the UK and their lickspittles in the media are equally complicit in genocide and should also be treated accordingly. I’m not advocating violence but constant challenge with a consistent message. Imagine if it had been Moscow Dynamo playing Belgium and their ultra supporters rioted outside the EU Parliament chanting offensive slogans and burning the Ukrainian and EU flags.\nIf the locals responded robustly, they would be hailed as heroes. Quelle difference?ShibbolethBecause, that’s exactly what these rabid nutcases are doing to anyone who speaks against their genocide.\nCampaigners against antisemitism have held protests outside universities in London against a visit by the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories.\nFrancesca Albanese, an international lawyer specialising in human rights and the Middle East, was taking part in an event at the London School of Economics and Political Science on Monday.\nShe recently published a report in which she alleged that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza but a “genocide”, and suggested the UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state.\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, described her in a tweet as unfit for office, adding: “The United Nations should not tolerate antisemitism from a UN-affiliated official hired to promote human rights.”\nAlbanese said she was right to insist on the term “genocide”, adding: “Palestinians had experienced war crimes all their lives, but this was different. It is very important to understand why this is recognised as a genocide.\n“In the same way as the international community has failed to protect the victims of genocide in the case of the Jewish people in Europe and then Bosnians in former Yugoslavia and the Tutsi in Rwanda, in the same way we are failing the Palestinians.”\nShe accepted that determining a genocide is complex due to the need to prove intent, but she claimed Israel’s intent was the destruction of Palestinian life.\nProtesters from the Campaign Against Antisemitism gathered outside the LSE on Monday where Albanese took part in “a conversation about international law and Palestine” hosted by the student union’s Grimshaw Club for international relations.\nPosts on social media showed dozens of protesters, armed with “Ban Fran” banners, gathered outside the university building in central London, with the message “Ms Albanese is not welcome at British universities”.\nFurther protests were planned outside Soas University of London where Albanese was speaking later on Monday. A protest outside Queen Mary University of London where Albanese is due to speak on Tuesday was cancelled, however.\nA spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said: “Due to threats in local residents’ groups to engage in ‘Amsterdam-style’ violence against our planned protest tomorrow, it will not be proceeding.\n“The safety of our team and supporters is an overriding concern for us. We are pursuing legal action against identifiable individuals who made threats.” Dozens of people were arrested after violent attacks took place around a football match between Amsterdam’s Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv last week.\nA Soas University of London spokesperson said: “Freedom of expression and academic freedom are fundamental to our existence. The increasing tendency of some political groups to demand that speakers they disagree with should be prevented from speaking is an approach we reject. We would only act to limit speech that breaks the laws, or advocates hate or violence.”\nAn LSE spokesperson said: “LSE is committed to providing an inclusive culture of equity, diversity and respect between individuals. Antisemitism and any other form of discrimination are completely unacceptable.\n“Free speech and freedom of expression underpins everything we do at LSE. Students, staff and visitors are strongly encouraged to discuss and debate the most pressing issues around the world, but this must be in a mutually considerate manner.”\nThe Union of Jewish Students did not respond to requests for comment but previously told the Jewish Chronicle that Albanese’s presence at London universities underscores the “increasingly belligerent environment” on British campuses.\n“We urge universities to consider the impact of hosting Ms Albanese and the message it sends to Jewish students and allies who are deeply affected by these statements. UJS’s welfare hotline continues to be open 24/7 for any Jewish students worried or affected.”\nJackhello mod I made a comment yesterday here but it is gone, any chance it was caught in the spam-filter?\n(I also made a comment containing lots of links in the Ukraine-thread and that comment is also vanished).Fat JonFrom reading Craig’s post on X, the site crashed (technical term) at some point overnight, and although the techs have it back now – the last 24 hours’ worth of messages appears to have been lost.\nAllan HowardI was just checking out The Times of Israel to see what they’ve posted on their website the last couple of days and, as such, came across the following article posted late last night (November 17th). It’s pretty long, and of course pushes the narrative that the Israeli football fans were the poor innocent victims etc, and denigrates any alternative narrative, and this one short passage sums it up:\n[Kevin] Kreuger [a council member] lamented the unwillingness to name the attackers by their background and motive, which he described as “Jew-hatred driven by Islam.”\n“Everybody saw the videos, heard the attackers speak Arabic. It’s like they are a group we need to feel sorry for and protect,” Kreuger said.Oh how the propagandists lurve turning everything on its head and amusing those in the know. And the author throws the following in as well, which I have little doubt is a falsehood, concocted to neutralise what the Israeli thugs did re the Palestinian flags:\nSince the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led massacre in southern Israel and subsequent conflict in Gaza, desecrating Israeli flags at protests has become a common occurrence in the Dutch capital.\n‘Who attacked Israelis in Amsterdam? Some Dutch politicians can’t bring themselves to say’\nPS And has anyone seen any vids of these ‘”youths on scooters” that have been mentioned repeatedly from day one, cos I HAVEN’T?\nPPS It just occurred to me to do a search on the ToI website re >protesters in amsterdam desecrate israeli flag< and absolutely nothing came up in the results.\nAllan HowardActually, thinking about it again, Kreuger isn’t so much turning it on its head… he’s mocking the people in Amsterdam who were outraged by the false narrative that was being disseminated by everyone, including the king, and the MSM. I’m referring to the bit where he says: “… It’s like they are a group we need to feel sorry for and protect”, and does so knowing of course that THAT is precisely what the propagandists et al did in relation to the Israeli thugs.\nAnyway, it was probably on the news last night, but I just put the BBC News channel on (albeit on mute whilst I typed out the above), and the banner headline (at the point when I turned it on) was ‘Biden Lifts Restrictions on US Missiles in Ukraine’, but that report ended about fifteen seconds later to be replaced by another banner headline (report) which said At Least 40 People Killed in Gaza (in a strike on an apartment building). Anyway, I did a search re the Biden story, and here’s the Daily Mirror (MSN) article about it:\n‘President Joe Biden lifts ban on Ukraine’s use of U.S. weapons for strikes on Russian soil’\nPresident Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to deploy American-supplied long-range missiles for strikes within Russian territory, according to senior US officials.\nThe decision marks a significant escalation in the States’ support for Kyiv, allowing Volodymyr Zelensky to use Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) with a range of nearly 190 miles…\nEarlier this year, Biden eased restrictions on America-made weapons in response to Vladimir Putin’s cross-border assault near the northern city of Kharkiv.\nAt that time, the US leader allowed Ukrainian forces to use the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System with a range of 50 miles to strike Russian positions near the border but stopped short of permitting the use of ATACMS.\nLooks like Genocide Joe is determined to start a nuclear war before he leaves office. Talking of which, I spotted the headline to the following article on there (posted on November 14th):\n‘Ukraine ‘months away’ from building devastating new atomic bomb that could annihilate Russian city’\nA new briefing document suggests Ukraine is months away from being able to make a new atomic bomb that could flatten a Russian city if the US drops military aid\nTop officials claim the country could unleash havoc reminiscent of Nagasaki on a city in Russia if American military support should dwindle. It’s suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky might turn to the “nuclear option” if Trump’s incoming administration cuts defense funding necessary for Ukraine to hold its ground against Russian incursions, as per a recent briefing note.\nI assume it’s B/S – ie that Ukraine is just months away etc – but needless to say, if they DID do such a thing, they would be committing suicide, and they know it.\nAh, I just did a search to see how widely it was reported in the MSM and, as such, came across the following (posted on November 15th):\nUkraine breaks silence on shock claim it may be ‘months away from building nuclear bomb’\nA bombshell report by a Ukrainian think tank suggested it would be ‘not difficult’ for Kyiv to build a nuke as a bargaining chip for any future negotiation with Russia.\nUkraine has spoken out after a think tank reportedly claimed that Kyiv would be able to develop a nuclear weapon within months, if Donald Trump follows through on threats to withdraw US aid as President.\nAccording to a research paper prepared for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence by the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies (CACDS), the country would have the means to build a basic device, one tenth of the power of the “Fat Man” bomb American forces dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, The Times reported.\nThe authors argued that the weapon could be used as a bargaining chip in any peace negotiation with Russia if the flow of weapons from Washington is cut off.\nThough Ukraine wouldn’t have time to develop huge secure facilities to enrich uranium in, it would be “not difficult” to use spent nuclear fuel from its nine power plants to create a basic atomic device, the report claimed…\nBut today Heorhii Tykhyi, spokesman for the Ukraine’s foreign ministry, firmly rejected any suggestion Ukraine was considering developing a nuke.\n“We do not possess, develop, or intend to acquire nuclear weapons,” he said, as per The Sun.\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1976251/ukraine-nuclear-weapons-bomb-russia-war\nSo that’s THAT then! WtF!!\nAllan HowardSorry about that, but I was just going with the flow, and just after I posted my comment (directly above), it occurred to me that most of it should have gone in the ‘Ukraine’ thread. Apologies.\nAllan HowardI won’t bother explaining how I came across it (last night), as it’s too damned convoluted, except to say that JVL re-posted it at the time, in October 2021:\nHow Dutch Israel lobby attacks free speech\nThere have been dozens of attacks on Palestinian rights defenders by Israel lobby groups in the Netherlands.\nSmear campaigns, threats of violence, attempts at defunding human rights groups, efforts to restrict academic freedom, threats of lawsuits and cyberattacks are among the intimidation tactics identified in a report released this month by the European Legal Support Center (ELSC).\nThe Israel lobby group CIDI has been at the forefront of attempts to stifle advocacy for Palestinian rights and efforts to hold Israel accountable.\nBut the 76 incidents documented in the report also involve other Dutch pro-Israel groups, media, political parties, faith-based organizations, Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs and the Israel-based group NGO Monitor…\nhttps://electronicintifada.net/blogs/adri-nieuwhof/how-dutch-israel-lobby-attacks-free-speech\nI wonder how many Israeli lobby groups there are around the world? I wouldn’t be at all surprised if it amounts to hundreds… Hundreds and hundreds!\nAllan HowardI thought THAT was me done for the night, but I just came across this Classic posted in a JVL thread about the Amsterdam affair, albeit belatedly:\nSo it’s bad of Israeli football fans to sing patriotic songs, but it’s ok for pro Palestinians to go round tearing down hostage posters and intimidating Jews.\nShibbolethReported on the World Service last night. Leaders in the settler movement, including the odious Daniella Weiss, have been taken into Gaza by the IDF to survey areas for future settlements. The Israeli spokesman claimed it would bring civilisation and stability to the Strip.\nIt is incredibly difficult to process the level of injustice, cruelty and malice that has been inflicted from those perpetrating this genocide, not only in Israel but from their allies in the US, UK and EU. The facilitation of this violence aided by the authorities in Holland and the football governing bodies, UEFA and FIFA, is a case in point. The Zionist regimes will subvert and manipulate every related incident to suit their own agenda – we can see how far their influence has spread. The horrors still await close scrutiny in Gaza; when they are finally revealed, there will be no hiding place.\nSurgeon’s evidence to Select Committee 12th November 2024\nShibbolethGaza is slightly larger (308 sq m) and more populous (2.1m) than Greater Glasgow – 189 sq m and 1.7m people. Imagine enclosing it within a security wall, stopping all food and water supplies then subjecting it to constant bombing, drone and sniper fire for over a year, whilst preventing any residents from leaving and seeking safety. There is nothing left that is recognisable, corpses litter the streets and decompose under the rubble. Nothing functions. Except death squads patrolling and killing at random.\nYou cant compare it. The Palestinians have endured a century of oppression and injustice. Gaza is the largest prison in the world and has been for decades. Thousands of Palestinian hostages are detained in Israel, many of whom are young children. Israel has stated it will end this conflict – and will do so in the only way it knows, by systematic extermination. Last century, another national and ideology attempted the same and was repulsed and defeated. It is incumbent and essential we do the same now.\nAllan HowardI was just checking out any new re-posted articles on JVLs website, and came across the following, posted today, which is well worth reading. Here’s the JVL introduction and a couple of passages from it:\nAvi Shlaim was interviewed by Mohammed Shaheen about his book Three Worlds: Memoirs of an Arab Jew.\nThey covered many topics including the different histories of Jews in Europe compared with Asia and North Africa and how the communities experience in Israel have been very different from the Nakba to the Gaza genocide driven by the logic of settler-colonialism.\nAvi explains how growing up,in Iraq has led him to advocate for “one state from the river to the sea with equal rights to all its citizens, regardless of religion and ethnicity” as the most hopeful future and an ending of apartheid.\nMS We have already established that you support the term ‘apartheid’ as an accurate description of the State of Israel, but what about ‘genocide’? Is this an apt description of Israel’s actions in the current war in Gaza?\nAS In my memoirs, I wrote that “for all its sins, Israel has not committed genocide.” I was forced to revise my opinion because in Gaza today, Israel is perpetrating genocide. Genocide is a very big word, and I was hesitant to use it, but when Israel stopped humanitarian aid, food, water, fuel, and medical supplies from reaching civilians in Gaza, that was the clincher for me. I have followed Israel’s military offensives in the Gaza Strip since Operation Cast Lead in 2008. By my count, this is the eighth Israeli military offensive, but it is by far the most destructive, devastating, and lethal. We are witnessing a new horror show that is extreme – even by Israeli standards. In ten months the IDF has killed nearly 40,000 people, mostly women and children; destroyed 70 percent of the housing and civil infrastructure of Gaza, and forcibly displaced over 90 percent of its population of 2.3 million, some of them as many as eight or nine times. The forcible displacement of civilians is a war crime. Israel is committing war crimes on an industrial scale and on a daily basis. If this is not genocide, I don’t know what is.\nMS Do you think Netanyahu is to blame for the continuation of this violence, and that the moderate voices in Israel are being ignored, or do you think the nation is collectively responsible?\nAS Netanyahu plays a major part in this ghastly assault on the people of Gaza. He is an obnoxious individual, a pathological liar, and an exceptionally selfish politician. His policy in Gaza is dictated by his political and personal interests. He is on trial at home for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Once he stops being Prime Minister, he will have to stand trial and most probably he will end up in jail, so it is in his interest to prolong the war. This is why he continues to frustrate all the efforts to secure a ceasefire and a release of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. But Netanyahu is not the only problem; Israeli society has been moving to the right steadily for the last 25 years. One manifestation of this shift to the right is the rise of two far-right religious Zionist parties: Religious Zionism, led by Bezalel Smotrich, and Jewish Power, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir. These are fascist Jewish supremacist parties whose aim is the ethnic cleansing of both the West Bank and Gaza, before officially annexing the former and resettling the latter. Netanyahu is not a simply a prisoner to his more extreme coalition partners, as many people believe; he is an extreme ethno-nationalist himself whose life mission is to prevent the birth of a Palestinian state. The assault on Gaza is an act of state terrorism. Terrorism is the use of force against civilians for political ends. Netanyahu is orchestrating this murderous state terrorism but, in the final analysis, the whole of Israeli society is responsible for it.\nhttps://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/avi-shlaim-interview/\nAs I’ve said on more than a few occasions, I have no doubt wharsoever that Netanyahu and his fascist buddies knew well in advance of the October 7th attack that Hamas was planning and training for such an attack and, as such, let it go ahead, and did so for a number of obvious reasons. And I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they actually instigated it in the first place, and when I say ‘they’, I mean Biden and Blinken and the rest of the Neo-Nazi regime that runs and controls most of the West. These inhuman monsters are evil to the core of their being, and evil beyond most peoples’ comprehension. And ‘Ukraine’ is another one of their demonic and diabolical creations/conceptions of course.\n-\nAuthorPosts",

And here, for once, is some good reporting in the Guardian:\n“Across Africa, hundreds of thousands of children who rely on school meals have been left without sustenance after food was left to rot in the wake of Musk’s declaration that he wanted the US aid agency to “die”.”\nMeanwhile Musk’s company Tesla has showrooms in several countries including Britain.

You can be certain they would have been well entrenched in that giant new compound in Beirut.\nIn Britain, USAID is the 3rd largest funder of the BBC, helping in the good fight against “disinformation”.\nThe Establishment/Ruling Elite around the world are inherently fascist, although in a few cases they are not actually ‘ruling’… not at the moment anyway.

This episode of Connections discusses Finkelstein’s recently-concluded research into Judge Sebutinde’s professional integrity, and his conclusion that she is serving as an agent of a foreign power.\nConnections offers timely and informative interviews on current events and broader policy questions, as well as themes relevant to knowledge production. It combines journalism, analysis, and scholarship.”\np.s. on Finkelstein´s book:\nhttps://www.normanfinkelstein.com/norman-finkelstein-new-book-reveals-icj-president-julia-sebutinde-guilty-of-wholesale-plagiarism/\n“NEW BOOK REVEALS\nICJ PRESIDENT JULIA SEBUTINDE GUILTY OF WHOLESALE PLAGIARISM\nONLY BRIBERY OR BLACKMAIL CAN EXPLAIN SEBUTINDE’S WHITEWASHING OF ISRAEL\nNews broke yesterday of plagiarism by president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Julia Sebutinde.\nIn July last year, the ICJ issued an advisory opinion that found Israel’s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territories to be “unlawful.”\nJudge Sebutinde issued a dissenting opinion in support of Israel that subverted the overwhelming international legal consensus.\nA report in Middle East Eye points to three instances in Justice Sebutinde’s dissent where the ICJ president appears to have lifted sentences directly from a paper by a key official in the administration of George W. Bush.\nIn fact, as explosive new findings by renowned Middle East researcher and analyst Norman Finkelstein demonstrate, the problem with Sebutinde’s judgment runs much deeper.\nFinkelstein documents that no less than 32% of Sebutinde’s dissenting opinion has been directly lifted from publications by notorious apologists for Israel.\nBut that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Finkelstein sets out, in painstaking detail, why the anomalies, errors, and legal contortions in Sebutinde’s dissent could have only resulted from either bribery or blackmail by the Israeli government.\nThe problem with Judge Sebutinde, according to Finkelstein’s research, is not just that she’s an unprofessional judge but that the president of the highest judicial body in the world is in thrall to a foreign power.\nThe full details of Finkelstein’s allegations against Sebutinde appear in a forthcoming book, Gaza’s Gravediggers: An inquiry into corruption in high places, copies of which will be available from OR Books in June 2025.\nFinkelstein received his doctorate from the Princeton University Department of Politics and has established himself, after decades of groundbreaking research, as the world’s leading “forensic scholar.”\nAmong those whose falsehoods have been exposed by his research are Joan Peters, Daniel Goldhagen, Alan Dershowitz, Jeffrey Goldberg, and Benny Morris.\nProfessor John Dugard, who served on the UN’s International Law Commission, has described Finkelstein as “probably the most serious scholar on the conflict in the Middle East.”\nSebutinde appears to have been got at by Israeli agents. If she were bribed, I wonder how much they paid her.\nYes, the ultimate question which Finkelstein too cannot answer is the “why” and the “how”.\nIt remains to be seen if the argument which he makes – laid out in its entirety by summer in his book – will have such an impact he believes would be adequate, ultimate resignation by Sebutinde. Unfortunately if no MSM will report this it won´t happen. And I do not see anyone from the media engaging into this matter who would have the intellectual skills and inclination. Just listen to him speak for those 90 min. and you will understand my doubts keeping in mind what dimwits are in the media today. I have listened to it. But I am not a journalist and neither am I an intern. lawyer. So I don´t matter.\nConsidering for what ridiculuous claims of plagiarism scholars had to step down in the past but only because they were on the wrong side politically – who should force Sebutinde out and further weaken the ICJ. Either you are pro-Israel and you hate the ICJ – either case you win. If you are in favour of the ICJ and in favour of truth you have a really hard time with her case in the light of delegimitization of the court that would go on after such a scandal. Of course Finkelstein suggests a silent method of her retiring, such as stating private reasons.\nWe will see. But for starters – people have to take note of Finkelstein´s work and that of those involved in the first place.\nMiddle Eastern Eye on this:\n“ICJ president ‘plagiarised 32 percent of pro-Israel dissenting opinion’\nIn fresh revelations, Palestinian researcher finds nearly one third of Julia Sebutinde’s legal view on Israeli occupation was directly lifted from unattributed sources ”\nhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/news/fresh-allegations-emerge-plagiarism-icj-president-israel-opinion\nFinkelstein makes clear the detailed account of the plagiarism was not his work but of some dude from Gaza making it to Doha.\nTrump is obviously senselessly deluded, now talking about taking over Gaza – and raze it. We are talking about of war of aggression, occupation, ethnic cleansing full stop. That Trump would be bad for the Middle East was perhaps written in stone but where are the outside world protesting? I thought when Trump was elected and would do all these crazy stuff one feared, people would protest, political oppositon (DNC, Labour, EU etc) would protest. But nothing.\nOn top of it, Trump has called for “maximum pressure” on Iran which include an oil embago, an act which is nothing but a declaration of war.\nIt is like a grotesque AIPAC arranged charade going on. Now Israel do not want to do the killing anymore and try to get US/american taxpayers do the rest of the destruction and killing!\nWhy would they protest about their genocide continuing?\nYep. Buckle up. No more liberal sissies. Genocide-Donald and Genocide-Elon are taking over. Behind the president hides the real estate mogul, who has realized what wonderful resorts could be set up in Gaza once the cleansing and razing is completed. The new Middle East Riviera. Not to mention the valuable natural resources…\nAnd when you can manage to blackmail Canada, Mexico and even China, you’re not worried of a million homeless Palestinians. They suffered under Netanyahu ? It may be worse under the US bulldozer…\nTotally mad observation to most on here I know, but here goes: nobody who gave unquestioning support to the US Democratic Party through 15 months of pitiless mass murder of women and kids actually supports the Palestinians.\nThe thing about these liberals ⬆️ is nothing ever humbles them. It doesn’t matter how many defeats they suffer or how many horrors are inflicted by the people they unquestioningly support, they’re always like this – sneering, belligerent and unfathomably arrogant.\nLet’s have alpha males rule, now and forever\nThe Junta Ka news analysis channel posted on YT last night a forty five minute excerpt of the joint press conference. I saw some if it. I may have been tired and not paying attention but I thought I heard President Trump say the clearing of Gaza was a recommendation, is this incorrect ? Did President Trump say US troops will be deployed to make this happen ?\nNote how it’s all about Trump in the British media re: Gaza today. They seem ‘allowed’ to praise, condemn or ridicule Trump while, by contrast, Netanyahu gets little more than an embarrassed shrug even from the ‘progressive’ Guardian for his wicked ‘ethnic cleansing’ of the Palestinian civilians. The whole terrible saga has highlighted even more obviously than before that the mainstream media are simply PR organisations for the powerful, and don’t work for ordinary people at all, beyond window-dressing stories to try to hide that reality.\nHow can they condemn Trump when they justified it all the way through when liberal governments were committing it?\nTrump Revives Biden’s Failed Proposal to Remove Palestinians from Gaza\nTrump wants Arab countries to take in Gaza’s population. The Biden administration already tried, and failed, to bribe and cajole Egypt into doing so.\nhttps://reason.com/2025/01/27/trump-revives-bidens-failed-proposal-to-remove-palestinians-from-gaza/\nWhat will the arab world do if Trump start threatening them with tariffs? Another risk is that Trump will find some obscure nations willing to take palestinians.\nThis move and the mere meeting with Trump will surely boost Netanyahu’s support inside Israel. A chance for grand ethnic cleansing and it will not even be done by Israel but by the US? Israel could not have wished for more. Israel/Jewish settlers obviously cheer today.\nHello Mr. Murray, thank you for the work you are doing. My thoughts are complete condemnation of Israel’s government and my own US government for its aid in genocide. Seeing your reports, I’m existing in a superposition of utter misanthropy for a species that could inflict this devastation on itself, and complete compassion for the unarmed murdered women and children, doctors, nurses, relief workers. I think of my support of Israel in my youth, because of some Palestinians taking hostages at the Olympics, hijacking airplanes, and suicide bombing. And how over the years I’ve come to understand Palestinians as the victims, for all the greater atrocities Israel has done to them. Ramzy Baroud just reported 90% of the homes in Gaza are destroyed. 90%! And my country is supposed to be against genocide. I think of the principles of the US founding fathers I internalized in school, and of the corporate totalitarians running my government today who care nothing for this. I think they’re commiting war crimes because they can, like gangsters, and also for control of oil. In other words, securing their profits. Profits that aren’t going to just destroy southern Lebanon, but our entire livable biosphere. I think education is vital, and I think US education has failed the world, by producing US citizens who vote for genocide. Goodness knows what kind of education the youth receive in Israel to produce and arm such obedient young men.\nI must confess I don’t really know anything about USAID, but in the process of doing a search to learn more about them, I came across the following Spectator article, posted yesterday. I should point out that you might have to close something on the page a few paragraphs down to then read the whole thing:\nWhy Trump hates USAID so much\nShutting down USAID is ‘exactly what autocrats all over the world want,’ says Michael McFaul, who was US Ambassador to Russia when Vladimir Putin expelled USAID in 2012. ‘Their work supported free markets, democracy, human rights – [all] causes that threatened Putin’s dictatorship.’\nCertainly, many avowed enemies of America have welcomed the move. ‘USAID is the antechamber of globalist Lodge,’ gloated ultra-nationalist Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, who denounced the agency as ‘the core of the deep state’ and ‘where the main monster of the Swamp dwells.’\nThe gutting of USAID’s $50 billion annual budget has also drawn whoops of delight from those in the US and beyond who argue that the agency has been systematically funding opposition activities and media outlets around the world that would not otherwise exist. USAID programmes have been instrumental, both supporters and critics say, in inciting protests and revolutions in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Romania. Furthermore, say critics, far from being truly independent, the groups funded by Washington are actually a fifth column for US influence.\n‘USAID, which is a CIA front, put $5 billion to fund those riots in 2014 in Ukraine,’ Robert F. Kennedy Jr – whose uncle, President John F. Kennedy, founded the agency in 1961 – told Tucker Carlson this week…\nhttps://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-trump-hates-usaid-so-much/\nThe following is from a Guardian article posted a couple of days ago:\nElon Musk says USAid is ‘beyond repair’ and he is working to shut it down\nUSAid is the world’s largest single donor. In fiscal year 2023, the US disbursed $72bn of assistance worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/Aids treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024.\nThe website of USAid appeared to still be offline on Saturday and some users could not access it on Sunday. USAid has a staff of more than 10,000 people.\nTrump has ordered a global freeze on most US foreign aid as part of his “America First” policy which is already sending shock waves around the world. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps, landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering from diseases such as HIV are among the programs at risk of elimination.\nSpeaking more broadly about cutting US expenses and fraud, Musk estimated the Trump administration can cut $1tn from the US deficit next year. Musk did not offer any evidence to support his fraud claim or explain how he reached the amount of $1tn.\nHe asserted, for example, that “professional foreign fraud rings” are stealing vast sums by masquerading as or creating fake digital US citizens.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/elon-musk-says-usaid-is-beyond-repair-and-he-is-working-to-shut-it-down\nAnd this is from a Guardian article posted yesterday (I don’t know if The Spectator posted anything from this perspective):\nDeaths predicted amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s shutdown of USAid\nOne former senior USAid official described Musk’s crackdown as an “extinction-level event” for the international humanitarian sector.\nThe initial repercussions include the abandonment in warehouses of supplies of crucial drugs in Sudan, the site of what is currently the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where recent fighting in the east has further destabilised the fragile region.\nAcross Africa, hundreds of thousands of children who rely on school meals have been left without sustenance after food was left to rot in the wake of Musk’s declaration that he wanted the US aid agency to “die”.\n“Partners on the ground [are saying] that in DRC and Sudan, medical supplies are stuck in warehouses,” said a spokesperson for a leading international aid organisation.\nAmong the projects already forced to close is a girls’ education project in Nepal, raising the risk of a rise in child marriage and trafficking.\n“All payments are frozen for these projects. There’s a lot of misinformation. Organisations are having to make decisions in a vacuum,” said one humanitarian official.\nIn Bangladesh, the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, which coordinates pioneering research into one of the most prolific killers of children, has laid off some of the world’s most respected scientists working on malaria programmes.\nIn Africa, malaria-control programmes in Uganda have been forced to adopt equally draconian measures with reports that dozens of vital projects for frontline care have been closed.\nFarther south in Malawi, where many rely on donor-funded programmes for survival, fears are mounting that the aid freeze could redraw the country’s entire economy.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/04/deaths-predicted-amid-the-chaos-of-elon-musks-shutdown-of-usaid\nRe. the Zionists’ puppet Trump’s idea about removing 2 million people from Gaza:\n* ROUNDUP\nBefore you transport people, you gotta round them up, and there are two ways to do that. You can either do it with a lot of force in which case you gotta shoot some of them, or you can do it with less force if you starve them for a month or so first, because their energy levels will be much lower.\n* PROCESSING\nYou can be certain that this plan will involve putting all survivors through airport-like checks, and it will be high-tech and I wouldn’t be surprised if tagging were used. They aren’t going to let many people take weapons with them.\n* ARRIVAL\nWhat about when they get to the camps they’re to be put in? Who’s going to run these camps? Because I can tell you the idea is NOT to allow those who run Gaza now to run them, i.e. Hamas plus allies. (Note that the MSM are reporting Trump’s words such as that Jordan and Egypt and maybe other countries have got to accept some Palestinians, but they’re not mentioning the obvious fact that if people are taken out of Gaza it will be CAMPS that they are taken to.)\n* A POINT REGARDING AID\nUNRWA – called “terrorist”. USAID – called a “criminal organisation” by Elon “Heil Victory” Skum. Nota bene that the US government is slashing aid (with Skum using the word “die”) at the same time it’s boasting about a plan to cleanse Palestine of 2 million Palestinians, something that if the victims were to be kept alive you might have thought would require some aid money.\nPS A note on Skum, who has called Hitler a “communist”. It may be relevant that the American Nazi Party used to be called the World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists (WUFENS),.\nSkum is a “Nazi-Fascist” – a Salo Republic kind of guy. Mussolini mostly (corporate state), plus some racism from Hitler and quite probably in his case from scum such as Verwoerd, plus some Social Darwinist “let the weak die” bullsh*t. What he’s got against Hitler isn’t what decent people have got against Hitler – it’s he thinks Hitler unlike Mussolini was too “statist” where big business was concerned.\nPeople should pay attention that Trump’s favourite leaders after his beloved Netanyahu seem to be Meloni and Milei. Meloni is literally the leader of the world’s ur-Fascist party.\nYou seem to forget Putin. Rest assured that all these great un-liberal leaders will be guests of honor in the future Mar-a-Gaza.\nJust found this, from March 2021, which is interesting. Here’s a passage from it for starters:\nCorruption in humanitarian relief and development programs: How to report USAID fraud\nAre USAID humanitarian relief and international development programs at risk for fraud?\nIn a word, yes. Humanitarian relief and international development programs can become targets for fraud.\nThe humanitarian relief community is filled to the brim with caring individuals who want to help those in need and do good in the world. But that doesn’t mean that relief efforts are immune from fraud and other misconduct.\nThere are many reasons for this. One is that government agencies that often fund humanitarian aid efforts are worlds away from where the work they fund is actually done. A USAID grant administrator, for example, may work in Washington, D.C., but distribute millions of dollars in funds that are spent in Afghanistan or Eritrea. Another reason is that unscrupulous individuals take advantage of humanitarian aid, lining their own pockets at the expense of vulnerable people these resources are supposed to help. They can do this because places that necessitate humanitarian relief lack the institutional structures to hold contractors that receive humanitarian-aid funds accountable for their use. Corrupt, non-existent, or woefully under-resourced law-enforcement authorities, judicial officers, and regulators are too often the norm in parts of the world ravaged by natural or man-made disasters.\nOf course, it’s not just USAID humanitarian relief programs that are vulnerable to fraud and abuse. International development programs face many of the same fraud risks. The United States government spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year on international development efforts, including through USAID, the Department of State, and other agencies. For example, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation has nearly $60 billion to finance private sector projects in poor countries, with the aim of developing their economies and creating strong trading partners. And these programs, too, may be magnets for fraud.\nhttps://constantinecannon.com/whistleblower/corruption-in-humanitarian-relief-development-programs-report-usaid-fraud/\nSo it would appear that people working for USAID itself aren’t involved in corruption and fraud… but crooks scamming the organisation. I seem to recall that the EU has the same problem. Just did a quick search…\n€1.8B worth of fraud in EU in 2022, watchdog says\nAnti-fraud agency says there was a 7 percent increase from 2021.\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-reports-increased-eu-funds-fraud/\nThis appears to blow Musk’s claim right out of the water (I’ve only read the first page, but this one passage from it surely knocks his – and the Trumpet’s – lies and smears on the head):\nUSAID is a leader in funding anti-corruption activities as part of its Democracy and Governance programs and participates with the State Department in activities mandated by the International Anticorruption and Good Governance Act. The first report under the Act, submitted in April 2001, discusses the USG help to foreign countries including USAID/OIG Fraud Awareness training in 25 countries and general training for over 20 Supreme Audit institutions.\nhttps://www.ignet.gov/sites/default/files/files/f01c12.pdf\nApologies Brian, I just spotted that you posted a link to the ‘Deaths predicted’ Guardian article yesterday.\nThis would be funny if not true, enjoy.\nQuiz: Can You Guess Which Of These Things USAID Actually Funded And Which Ones We Made Up?\nhttps://babylonbee.com/news/quiz-can-you-guess-which-of-these-things-usaid-actually-funded-and-which-ones-we-made-up\nOmg! And presumably most of them believe in god, or something:\nOnly 3% Of Jewish Israelis Think Trump’s Ethnic Cleansing Plan For Gaza Is Immoral\nThree percent. If that isn’t a sign of a morally diseased society, I don’t know what would be.\nCaitlin Johnstone\nFebruary 5, 2025\nhttps://caityjohnstone.medium.com/only-3-of-jewish-israelis-think-trumps-ethnic-cleansing-plan-for-gaza-is-immoral-1cfefd5e08b4\nWhat a totally fucked-up crazy world we live in, where the vast majority of Israeli Jews support a plan conceived by goddam Nazis.\nPS It just occured to me… I wonder if the Israeli media in general reported about Musk’s Nazi salute?!\nBritish state media telling lies about what Trump has said about Gaza:\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gw89x8x11o\n“Trump said Palestinians living in Gaza would have to be relocated to achieve his vision of creating “the Riviera of the Middle East”, and that they would be housed in Jordan, Egypt and other countries.”\nHe didn’t say “housed” or imply it.\nHere’s what he actually said:\n“Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly bad luck. This can be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, twelve. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace and we’ll get – we’ll make sure something really spectacular is done.”\nDoesn’t sound like semi-detached surburbia he’s thinking of. Also he said 1.5 milion. The population of Gaza is ~2.2 million.\nReported elsewhere.\n2.2M – 1.5M = the number of Palestinians bibii told donny he’d killed.\nThe Orange One – has his Eye of Sauron fixed on Gaza.\n“U.S. President Donald Trump has said that the United States should become party to a major crime against humanity by expelling 1.8 million people from their land in the Gaza Strip as it becomes a territory of the United States.\n“The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday at a press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “We’ll own it and be responsible” for the territory, Trump said, which would be turned into “the Riviera of the Middle East.”\nTrump did not explain under what legal authority the Israeli occupied territory of Gaza could become the territory of the United States. It is not legally Israel’s territory to give away to anyone, but international law has rarely impeded Israel, or the United States. ”\nhttps://consortiumnews.com/2025/02/04/trump-wants-us-to-take-over-ethnically-cleanse-gaza/\nAnd.\nIf there was any doubt that Trump wasn’t pro-Zionist – this should dispel that myth, businessman or not.\n“Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave US President Donald Trump a gold-plated pager and a standard one during their meeting at the White House in Washington, DC on Tuesday, according to Israeli media. The gift is an apparent reference to Israel’s covert sabotage operation in Lebanon.\nTrump reacted to Netanyahu’s gift by calling the Israeli attacks a “tremendous operation,” media reports claimed. In return, he gave Netanyahu a signed photograph of their meeting, with the message: “To Bibi, a great leader.”\nThousands of pagers, primarily used by Hezbollah militants, exploded simultaneously in Lebanon and parts of Syria on September 17. The following day, hundreds of walkie-talkies detonated in a similar wave of blasts. The attacks reportedly resulted in at least 42 fatalities, including 12 civilians – and injured over 3,500, including women and children.\nThe operation was widely attributed to Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and perceived as a preemptive strike. In the aftermath, Israel intensified its military campaign in Lebanon, culminating in the assassination of long-time Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a September 27 airstrike on Beirut.”\nMockingbird whistles\nCrows clap, beaks red : Blackbird\nSings “Spring is coming”\nA pair of narcissist war criminals of the worst kind holding the tiller against the current of world opinion.\nOnly a force 12 gale spreading much harm to all those who are in this hicky boat, can break the rudder and send them to oblivion where they belong.\nSadly\nThe state of Israel is and was a wedge between the prize that Mackinder spoke of when he coined the phrase, The world island! I am sure you are familiar with lord Mackinder as well as the area that is the world island. Israel is a Zionist state, and Zionists are not traditional Jews as the founder was an atheist. I read an eye-opening book recently, Zionism during the Holocaust and it was verry disturbing as the Zionists were collaborating with the Nazis about the Jews that they wanted, and they were the wealthy, the brain trust and only Palestine was the location for the deportees and the only place due to the terrorist campaign for statehood, all others were given over for extermination, so it appears that most of the victims were sacrificed by the Zionists. The ship that the Frank family traveled to the USA on was turned away and their fate was sealed with the aid of the US government. so, things are never what we are told, ever!

  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2025_01_israeli-atrocities-in-lebanon_comment-page-1/content_16.html": "Yesterday, not only did Israel fail to evacuate its army from Southern Lebanon as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, Israel also shot over 130 Lebanese civilians attempting to return home in accordance with the deal, killing 23 and wounding 109 (of whom some are in critical condition).\nThis included a 12 year old boy wounded in the neck in Kfarkela, standing right next to my local producer Mahmood. I was twenty yards away and on my way to them. Four were killed in Kfarkela and overnight the Israeli army demolished numerous homes there in “punishment”.\nOver 100 people shot by the Israelis today in Lebanons, with 11 dead. A 12 year old boy was wounded by Israeli fire standing right next to one of my team, just before this. pic.twitter.com/wsMp7XCiKu\n— Craig Murray (@CraigMurrayOrg) January 26, 2025\nApart from one Lebanese army solider, all of the dead were civilians simply attempting to return to their homes. At least five of the dead were children. All were shot, not bombed.\nIsrael’s excuse for not withdrawing is that the ceasefire agreement is not fulfilled, in that Hezbollah have not been disarmed south of the Litani river, and that the Lebanese army has not assumed control.\nI have spent every waking hour of three days travelling the entire southern border (remember Lebanon is a very small country; the entire country is the area of Yorkshire or Connecticut – the demarcated border region is much smaller still).\nI can guarantee the Lebanese army is fully in control of the area. There are army checkpoints at every major crossroads and town entrance and at every track into the hills. What is more to the point, I saw nobody at all except for the Lebanese army carrying weapons.\nHezbollah are a significant political presence still – they are the largest political party in Lebanon – but they are not carrying arms in the ceasefire zone south of the Litani. Furthermore the Lebanese army has indeed occupied and taken over or dismantled Hezbollah’s military positions in this zone. They have confiscated over 50 arms caches.\nThe only areas of Southern Lebanon not under the control of the Lebanese armed forces are those areas occupied by the Israeli army.\nThe role of the Lebanese army is extremely dubious, but 100% in Israel’s favour. The Lebanese army is fully under US control. Literally, 50% of the salary of every single Lebanese soldier is directly paid by the US Government.\nYesterday the Lebanese army simply watched the Israeli army massacre Lebanese civilians. If the Lebanese army was protecting anybody yesterday, it was protecting the Israeli Defence Force.\nSill more extraordinary, the new Lebanese Government failed to protest at the Israeli failure to withdraw, and the Trump administration has subsequently announced that Lebanon has agreed to extend the withdrawal deadline until 18 February.\nIn fact neither Israel nor the USA ever had the slightest intention of IDF withdrawal. Israel has demolished more than 2,000 Lebanese homes during the ceasefire period, about half of them in towns and villages which Israel was unable to reach during the fighting but has occupied during the ceasefire.\nI visited the city of Khiam yesterday and was simply stunned by the scale of devastation. Over 1,000 homes have been demolished by Israel in Khiam.\nAmongst all the debris, I managed to track down the piano of Dr Julia Ali, which became an internet meme after she posted video of herself playing it in her beautiful home, and then Israeli soldiers mocking it after the home was devastated.\nThe house is an interesting case study. The Zionist propagandists replied to the internet videos by stating that there was a Hezbollah rocket installation in the garden. I searched extensively and found absolutely no evidence this was anything except a civilian home. There were no signs of anything unusual in the garden.\nThe house was not bombed – it was part demolished with explosives, shot up and set on fire, after being used as an Israeli barracks. The surviving furniture was ripped up with knives, and the mirrors, chandeliers, piano, porcelain and crystal all smashed.\nWomen’s clothing was strewn all around, as were dolls. Large obscene drawings and Hebrew graffiti were painted on the walls. In a room used for meals, used paper plates were all upside down on the floor and had been used to smear the food around. The floor was littered with food tins, used plastic cutlery, empty drink bottles and human excrement, again deliberately smeared around.\nThroughout the building and garden were scattered numerous ammunition boxes, from small arms to tank rounds. All of it was USA manufactured.\nAll of the television sets, satellite receivers, music systems and kitchen electricals were ripped out, as was the generator set.\nI went to the neighbouring villa, where a lady owner was salvaging from the wreckage with her son in law. Again, all of the electrical equipment and the generator set had been taken. Also disappeared was jewellery, a highly valuable collection of antique rugs, and significant paintings. None of this was among the rubble.\nWe investigated further in the area and could find no instance of any TVs or valuables, or their remnants, being discovered in the rubble. We also found instances of shops, particularly a designer clothes shop and a phone shop, whose entire content had been looted.\nA soldier cannot put a generator set or an antique carpet in his backpack. This industrial scale of looting has to be officially sanctioned by the IDF and involve military transport vehicles, or vehicles requisitioned by the military.\nIt may not compare to the murder of children, but is itself a war crime. The western MSM, which made a huge noise about Russian looting in Ukraine, has never mentioned this massive Israeli looting.\nThe Ceasefire Agreement was a disgrace that was bound to lead to this conclusion. The notion that its monitors, France and the United States, are in any sense neutral is laughable. Israel has no intention whatsoever of withdrawing from Southern Lebanon and continues daily destruction of Lebanese homes while constructing at least five fortified military bases.\nWhat I still find astonishing is that new Lebanese President Aoun and Prime Minister Mikati have agreed to extend the Israeli occupation on these obviously false pretexts. Israel has committed over 120 documented violations of the ceasefire. Hezbollah has committed one, in early December, in response to multiple Israeli attacks on civilians.\nHezbollah is in real danger of looking a busted flush. It agreed to disarm in the ceasefire deal, which would leave Israel able to annex Southern Lebanon with no serious opposition on the ground. It does seem that Hezbollah’s war losses and the assassination of its leadership cadre has left it incapable of any significant military response to extended Israeli occupation. Its response to yesterday’s massacre has been only rhetoric.\nAs of today, Israel appears well set to consolidate its extension of Greater Israel into both Southern Lebanon and Southern Syria, with the active complicity of US backed governments in both Beirut and Damascus.\nIn the long term, I believe the atrocities of Israel will be rejected by the people of the region and bring about its downfall. But currently it is Netanyahu and Trump who are smiling.\n———————————–\nWe have no finance at all for this work except our readers.

Please share using the links below ”\nThis disgusting behaviour by the israelies needs to be broadcast Worldwide.\nExcellent report. Israel appears untouchable, they can literally do what they want, and their entire western fan club will defend their right to kill and maim, in the name of defence. On this day the PR machine is turned up to maximum and we can expect sickening, fawning statements from the likes of Starmer and the rest of the western political ‘kapos’.\nOne, maybe, unintended consequence of Israel’s actions is that a lot of people now will have little or no sympathy for victms of the, so called, holocaust.\nJanuary 27 marks the day the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp\nStarmer:\n“The Holocaust was a collective endeavour by thousands of ordinary people utterly consumed by the hatred of difference. That is the hatred we stand against today and it is a collective endeavour for all of us to defeat it.”\n“We must start by remembering the six million [?] Jewish victims and by defending the truth against anyone who would deny it.” [and by destroying anyone who questions what actually happened]\n“But as we remember, we must also act. Because we say ‘never again’ – but where was never again in the genocides of Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur – and where is never again as antisemitism kills Jewish people still?” [What about Palestinians ?]\n“ We will make Holocaust education a truly national endeavour. … We will ensure all schools teach it”\n[Brainwashing on behalf of Israel]\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/holocaust-memorial-day-starmer-urges-uk-to-stand-up-to-hatred_uk_67963551e4b04c7554f54131\nWhat he’s pushing with the idea that “the Holocaust was a collective endeavour by thousands of ordinary people” is the idea that the Palestinians are collectively responsible for wickedness and must be punished.\nAlso it’s worth pointing out that on a purely factual level the mass murder committed by German forces 80-90 years ago was NOT a collective endeavour by thousands of ordinary people.\nSTEVIE BOY-Unwise to make the suggestion that sympathy for victims 80 odd yrs ago is conditional. The holocaust was an atrocity of monstrous dimensions and historical gravity.\nIt was notable that the BBC public farter, Fiona Bruce talked through her fart hole about the warning to ‘never let it happen again” when such a lot is going on in Gaza and Lebanon. (Not unrelated ) I don’t rate ms Bruce as an honest reporter but she must have noticed events, so we must infer she must be happy to make such a disordered, witless vacuity.\nNo honest reporter would work for the BBC.\nThe phrase “She’s only obeying orders” comes to mind.\nWhy is that ? People in general, IMO, tend to judge the past based on their current prejudices and events. It may not be rational, or nice, but that’s the way it works. My point is that Israel’s actions are undermining sympathy for Jewish holocaust victims and that’s entirely the fault of Israel.\n@ Stevie People in general, IMO, tend to judge the past based on their current prejudices and events.\nEvidence? Examples?\nGreat reporting once again Craig. Yes unfortunately the appeasement by arab leaders just keep getting worse, the other day it was reported how Saudi Arabia is going to invest some $600 billion in some shady deal with Trump – in return Trump will try to force palestinians out of Gaza into the arab world and by that kill off the palestinian statehood for good. But I assume one must be realistic, this is the “new” Middle east: Arab leaders openly bow down to US, Israel letting them get away with everything and the arab population seems to be OK with it. How do the lebanese PM sell in this appeasement to his public?\nThe incompetent leadership in Lebanon obviously believe that Israel is only against Hezbollah – like themselves. But Israel hate Hezbollah as much as they hate every other group in Lebanon – that is why Israel feel free to kill and throw the “ceasefire”-agreement straight to the bin.\nBrave reporting, making sober reading that can only intensify the hypocrisy of the official commemorations of 80th Holocaust Memorial Day.\nOnce again, thanks Mr. Murray for being the first to really report live from where it is all happening.\nNamely Southern Lebanon, as I had previously suggested yesterday. Everybody knew the ceasefire wouldn’t end in the conditions previously envisioned, but nobody knew what exactly could happen. Unfortunately, it is too expensive in terms of bloodshed, as if Gaza wasn’t enough.\nIt seems that fortunately your GoFund account is doing better since you returned to Beirut. Let’s hope you can soon find the funds to provide us with equally valuable reports from Syria!\nBravely done, Craig. Please watch yourself there – I’m sure those blood-thirsty psychopaths are watching you.\nHearing the “Never Again™” crowd falling over themselves condemning one genocide, while they cheer on another, was pretty revolting today. It’s always the anniversary of something for the Israelis to dine out on yet again.\nPS Please post this on Bluesky!\nForgot to ask …. “the Israeli army demolished numerous homes there in “punishment””\nPunishment for what??\nReturning to their homes in defiance, resisting, existing, take your pick. Demolishing homes as punishment is par for the course in all the land illegally occupied by Israel.\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/10/collective-punishment-israel-demolishes-palestinian-homes\nCraig, thank you for this reporting.\nThank you Craig.\nSo depressing.\nTypical of the mainstream British media and political class: They are too corrupt and dishonest to tell us (never mind do anything) about a holocaust this year, so they have been giving top billing all day to a holocaust 50 years ago (and normal political discourse virtually suspended, incredibly). Thanks for some real journalism, Craig.\n80 years ago Tom. However, was good to see the inbred, German Royals undergoing ritual humiliation doing the goy grovel shedding, crocodile, tears for all the Jewish dead. But no tears for Palestine, nazis must stick together I guess.\nJust a reminder that the mass murder in Germany started with the mentally and physically disabled, and children in particular. It did not start with Jews.\nDOG FOX FIELD, Les Murray\nThese were no leaders, but they were first\ninto the dark on Dog Fox Field:\nAnna who rocked her head, and Paul\nwho grew big and yet giggled small,\nIrma who looked Chinese, and Hans\nwho knew his world as a fox knows a field.\nHunted with needles, exposed, unfed,\nthis time in their thousands they bore sad cuts\nfor having gazed, and shuffled, and failed\nto field the lore of prey and hound\nthey then had to thump and cry in the vans\nthat ran while stopped in Dog Fox Field.\nOur sentries, whose holocaust does not end,\nthey show us when we cross into Dog Fox Field.\nIf you compare the criteria for the murder of disabled newborns, babies, toddlers children, adolescents and adults with the eugenic criteria in the Abortion Acts, you won’t find much difference.\nThank you for courageously reporting these brutish and depraved atrocities.\nLebanon’s complicity in its own ruin at US hands seems incresible but it is far from unique. It is only a degree or two more craven than Germany’s.\nThe British are on the same trajectory under Starmer and his controllers. A few days ago they exempted children of US soldiers from VAT on private school fees in the UK while children of British troops and children with SEND needs must pay full price.\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/labour-exempts-america-soldiers-children-private-school-vat/\nIs this cuckery because the Hegemon has decided to take off the gloves, figuring there’s nothing to lose after what the world has seen it do to Gaza and the Germans and Ukrainians? “Everyone’s very aware of what we are now, so we’re not going to bother anymore with niceties or pretence”.\n@frankwiggles – British “troops”? Officers, more like.\nDoesn’t the British army already pay the fees for some children to go to boarding school here, while army officer Daddy is stationed in Cyprus or Belize or Oman or wherever? Maybe they only pay the boarding component?\nThe guys at the Torygraph don’t give a toss about children with “special needs”, any more than they care about privates who came back traumatised from Afghanistan. It’s the posho army officers not getting enough respect (and subsidy) when they send their offspring to boarding schools that they care about. (Emphasis on boarding.)\nAll I can say is it’s good to see a punch-up within the ruling class.\nOkay, I’ve looked this up now.\nI was right. Yes, the British armed forces do pay lots of money to send their officers’ offspring to private boarding schools.\nIt’s called the Continuity of Education Allowance. I’m told it can cover up to 90% of boarding school fees.\nWhat a bunch of f***ing scroungers.\nhttps://aff.org.uk/advice/money-and-allowances/continuity-of-education-allowance/\nDo any British people reading this sometimes get the feeling they’re living in Austria-Hungary?\nStunning Images Show Tens Of Thousands Of Gazans Returning To Destroyed Homes On Foot https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/stunning-images-show-tens-thousands-gazans-returning-destroyed-homes-foot\nNo doubt Jerad Kushner and his father in Law Donald Trump will look on in horror and wonder where all his beachfront properties and other real estate deals [in Gaza] will materialize when the Palestinians stay put and reject Trumps overtures for Jordan and Egypt to take them.\nIf they try to “clean out” Gaza, to use a foul Zionist dehumanising term that’s very similar to how they talked when they expelled everyone from Haifa and is now a term used by the deranged in-law of the Kushners that you mention, it’s p>95% that they will attack on a large scale in the West Bank at the same time.\nAny day now, we could read “Large terror facilities discovered in Jenin, Jericho, and Ramallah”, with Macron and Scholz and Genocide Britboy all saying “Israel has the right to defend itself”.\nWhere are their weaknesses?\nBrian Red.\n‘ Their weakness’ is the fact that nearly all of this devastation has been recorded and will be available in future trials for the perpetrators to admit to.\nMay not be my lifetime or yours but, Empires fall and the US one will be no different.\nAll about time and changes and all on the record for future use.\nVery inspiring today on the Palestinians march back to Northern Gaza to their land.\nTrump now has a choice:\nDoes he let them stay or does he allow Israel ( supplied with more 2k bombs courtesy of the US ) to re-bomb the people out of Gaza once again?\nHe has also said he wants to ‘clean up ‘ the whole of Palestine.\nHow exactly does he do that without looking worse than Biden and being as he has allegedly re- asserted the idea that the US dog wags the Israeli Tail can he explain to an already appalled world why Israel is getting its bidding done by the US again by clearing Palestine?\nHe also has to explain the same to his own people and supposedly grow the US economy.\nThe US public are not mad keen on throwing money at other countries instead of throwing it at them.\nMaybe Israel will come under the same pressures ?- we shall see.\nIronically a lot of WASPS who make up some of his base do not like any Jews – never mind Israeli jews.\nAs always we shall see.\np.s. I disagree with Craig re: Hezbollah.\nJust because Israel and the US have won a few battles – it doesn’t mean they have won the War.\nThe Israelis supposedly have sold the idea to their population that Hamas is defeated ergo the Gazans are defeated.\nYet – here they are bravely walking back to their land in complete contradiction to that lie told to the Israelis.\nThe release of the Israeli hostages ( yes the were in the Military despite the denials) in decent nick is another lie blown open.\nSo – the effect will be more interesting on the Israelis and Netanyahu is in Court today so, we will see what develops between him and the Israeli people and of course he and Trump.\nHezbollah have cease fired because they do not want the Lebanese people to be bombed – simple as that for me.\nBut as with Iran – cockyness from the US and Israel could force countries into a position where the end up with no choice but to fight back.\nThat time is approaching and the overstretch from Israel is becoming more and more apparent.\nThe US is not strong enough Militarily to take on Russia/China and cause trouble in The Middle East.\nThis is why everything is proxied – particularly war.\nIf the US attacks Iran then they will have to become more physically involved\nin these wars.\nThe US public does not like dead US Military people returning home in coffins.\nIf Trump is responsible for making that happen he will pay a massive political price.\nThe question is: is that a price he wants to pay personally?\nAFAIAA Trump has only talked about “cleaning out” Gaza, not the whole of Palestine, but the involvement of Jordan suggests there would be mass expulsions from the West Bank too. (But not even Gaza plus West Bank plus Jerusalem constitute the whole of Palestine.)\nI detest the USA but underestimating its strength militarily can be as big an error as overestimating it. It’s possible the USA in Syria demonstrated to both Russia and China some kind of military capability that they didn’t expect, when Assad was brought down so fast and without a battle.\nIt appears that the Israelis are balancing their ‘losses’ in Gaza with ‘wins’ in the west bank. I do believe that 2025 will see the attempted clearing of the West bank and that this is one of the conditions put on Trump by Adelson and her blood money.\nThe cynical hypocricy by western leaders on show today takes some believing. The double standards blatantly on show are breathtaking. Two International courts have declared Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Deafening silence from Starmer and his stooges. Netanyahu is undergoing corruption proceedings in Israel. Again, more silence from Starmer and the Stooges.\nYour excellent article puts the vast majority of our mainstream media to shame. Add Trump into the equation and follow the money. Most Arab leaders ignore the feelings of their people and collude with the tyrants and the ultra wealthy.\nEisenhower warned of the ‘Arms Industrial Complex’ in the late ’50’s. Sadly, his warnings have been ignored. Trillions are spent on the arms trade (or, you could say, Trillions are made selling arms).

Vindictive, hideous, cruel, inhuman and moronic, who demonstrate their contempt for all others outside of their precious little US taxpayer funded bubble of their racist atrocity exhibitions. If you ever wondered how evil people can be, how low they can sink, leaving any semblance of common decency or morality behind, they are a case study in the abandonment of any such claim. How can we stand by and witness such wanton desecration, which cheapens and degrades everything we might value? It is a kind of nihilism, built on the certainty of the deliberate removal of any accountability, responsibility or legality. And worst of all, they want to rub all of our noses in their glee at being declared by the US and its ‘allies’ as untouchable. They are intent on demonstrating they can do whatever they like to whomsoever they like, regardless of age, gender, status, nationality or group.\nThey want you to be shocked, dismayed and frightened of them, they want to show that in order to get their way, they will destroy everything which sustains human life in the areas they covet – a systematic, deliberate policy of destruction of homes, villages, towns, cities and all of the infrastructure – particularly hospitals, schools, civil institutions and necessary resources of food, water and energy.\nIt is pure scorched earth annihilation. And barely a critical word in the West, or even basic reporting of what is going on.\nThanks to Craig for providing this information, which any worthwhile properly funded news organisation could do, but chooses not to.\nAlthough i fear for his life, given the value of his reporting, and the deliberate killing of journalists already, those brave enough to report in Gaza particularly.\nThe whole thing is nauseating, and very hard to take. Thanks, israel, for your contribution to extinction studies and the demise of our hopes in humanity.\n“The Zionist propagandists replied to the internet videos by stating that there was a Hezbollah rocket installation in the garden”\nWell Mandy Rice-Davies did move to “Israel”.\nJust some crude military speculation here… But what if the occupation is *so* geared up for these chevauchée type operations against civilians in urban areas, possibly soon to cover the West Bank and again Gaza, and maybe what they’ll call an n-front war, that they’ll be weaker at home?\nI mean what are their weaknesses? This is what their opponents must ask.\nThere are examples of armies that have been overly configured to do a particular job, e.g. French army in WW1, British army in Singapore in WW2.\nAnd today with no hint of irony Prince Charles and many others at Auschwitz talked of “never again”, and numerous speakers used the occasion to declare their love of and support for Israel.\nIt is hard to imagine how the ptb have the gall to parrot “never again” while they are doing the same thing to the citizens of Palestine.\nThank you Craig for this report and shining a light on a piece of the world that the msm would prefer to keep under wraps.\nTrue reporting Craig.. Close call though .. Bless the wee shot soul.\nImagine the West’s Fake Reporters were as brave as You.. But As Glen Says..They Are Watching You..\nAnd Acording to Caitlin Johnston ..the Evil Bastards Shot a Two year old baby in the head Yesterday .\nStay safe Craig.\nBear in mind, Colin, that Prince Charles has never visited Israel. It is still Palestine to him. And by stating Never again! he is coming as close as he dare to expressing his concern. The horrors of Auschwitz remain horrors. It used to be remembered as 4 million Jews, though, and 2 million Gypsies, other racial minorities, and learning disabled and mentally ill, but they don’t want to remember the other victims. And they use the horror to justify their actions. Charles has no jurisdiction over our elected government’s policy. William and Kate have made several unofficial visits and one official visit, since Kate’s family home is in Jordan. Charles is always diplomatic. Times change and we are caught up in the mess which we powerless ones are trying to address. We ought never to have got involved in bombing Russia without declaring war against them. Russia has been consistent in keeping the conflict strictly within the borders of Ukraine, for the purpose of defending the Russian speaking minority. Biden has dragged us into this awfulness and we have no choice but to trust that Trump will get us out of it.\nThis is exemplary journalism. Very few people would go to these lengths for people in a foreign country. It’s giving an example of an entirely different way of being in the world, which reflects genuine compassion and fairness. Unfortunately I can’t see the example spreading very far with the strength of forces ranged against it. But it’s a superb effort nonetheless.\nIf you look through history you’ll see that the best people are always attacked, maligned, isolated, misrepresented, etc. They are always in a small minority – from Socrates right up to the present. Nothing really changes morally as far as I can see. Obviously nothing you’re doing will change the course of events, but if it helps a few people on the ground in Lebanon and brings clarity to a few people who read your coverage and changes their perceptions of the way the world works, then that’s something important.\nYou can never be sure of the knock on effects off good work like this – it can permeate into places you wouldn’t expect.\nThe Israeli and western assault on Gaza and part of Lebanon is mass murder of unarmed women and children. Israel uses U.S.-made large 2000lb bombs, attack jets, and naval vessels to bomb densely crowded refugee camps, schools, apartment blocks, mosques, and slums to attack a population of mostly women and children that has no air force, no air defence, no navy, no heavy weapons, no artillery units, no mechanised armour, and no army, and calls it a war. It is not a war. It is a televised genocide supported by no other than the unconscionable U.S.-led Western regimes that have always claimed to be the global “defenders” of “democracy,” “freedom,” and “human rights.” In truth, they are serial killers and mass murderers of hapless people in the middle east. Keir Starmer and David Lammy are willing accomplices and are directly responsible in helping the Genocidal state of Israel murder as many Palestinians as possible by supplying them with the military wherewithal for them to do so. These two disgusting psychopaths need to be gone tout sweet, they will get us all killed.\nThank you, Craig. Unfortunately we live in a country where western/zionist crimes are rationalised if they are acknowledged at all.\nThis for example was Layla Moran MP yesterday:\n“On Holocaust Memorial Day, we remember the lives of six million Jewish people, and the thousands of Roma and Sinti, black, gay, disabled and others, who were murdered.\nWe also remember the genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur and the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang.”\nhttps://x.com/LaylaMoran/status/1883856589926367301\nXinjiang mentioned and not a word about Gaza.\nThis liberal MP Layla Moran is the daughter of a Palestinian.\nThese are the moral depths you must plumb in order to get on in liberal politics in the west.\nAgain, Anthony, our spokespersons are restrained by our government’s complicity. By mentioning other genocides and being there as a Palestinian, this is as close as she dare go.\nWe still jokingly have what we call a free and democratic society, no-one, particularly MPs, are constrained in what they say. To remain silent is complicity, to remain silent to protect your job is moral corruption.\nNo excuses for these people.\nI note that the speech of Irish President Michael Higgins on the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz* was greeted by howls of protest and accusations of anti-semitism because if dared to mention Palestinians and Palestine, and even the need to trace the root of the conflict in the Middle East in the context of human rights.\nAll the more reason for it to be widely known!\n* https://president.ie/en/media-library/speeches/speech-at-national-holocaust-memorial-day-commemoration\nBut looking at South Lebanon more specifically, something appears wrong.Hezbollah was effectively resisting Israeli attempts at ground incursion till the ceasefire. Why suddenly appear to let them walk all over the place, killing as they please? Is there something wrong, that we’re not being told?\nA very good alternative Jewish look at the problem with zionism and israel:\n“It was predicted and warned about, as the Zionist movement grew, that the effect of creating a Jewish nation-state would be Jews being seen in the light of that state’s actions.”\nhttps://www.counterpunch.org/2025/01/28/the-shame-of-what-weve-done/\nThanks for this, looks like an excellent article. I’ve made a note of the link to Beinart’s book as well (ISBN 1805464515, hopefully a cheaper paperback edition will become available in a year or so).\nAnd the scandal at ICJ just keeps on growing:\n“The International Court of Justice president, Julia Sebutinde, is a plagiarist”\nhttps://palestinenexus.com/articles/sebutinde-is-a-plagiarist\nI summarized Sebutinde’s absurd dissent here:\nhttps://www.craigmurray.org.uk/forums/topic/breaking-news-gaza-only/page/33/#post-102643\nSpeaking on ICJ, it is insane that Lebanon itself do not file a suit against Israel at the ICJ/ICC after their assault on Lebanon.\nHow could we stop Israel if the very people, very nations that are attacked by Israel do not care?\nI wonder how Israelis pulled that off…(to get her there in the light of the fact that Ugandans must have known before how this would play out, you don´t turn into a Zionist overnight.)\nin other news on ignorance, compliance and complacency of our German friends:\n“Raz Segal: Genocide Denial in Holocaust Studies\nScholar Raz Segal recounts the strange experience of being attacked as an antisemite, despite being Jewish himself and studying the Holocaust and other genocides, for the high crime of opposing Israel’s slaughter in Gaza.”:\n“https://jacobin.com/2025/01/gaza-genocide-holocaust-studies-germany”\n“(…)\nWhat lies at the core of the unconditional support Germany extends to Israel\n(…)\nA close partnership between Israeli and German Holocaust scholars offers some troubling answers to this question. In an online event organized by the Holocaust Studies Program at the Israeli Western Galilee College (WGC) on December 19, 2024, three speakers — Alvin Rosenfeld, a professor of English and Jewish Studies at Indiana University; Verena Buser, a German historian who teaches online at the WGC; and Lars Rensmann, a professor of political science at the University of Passau in Germany — attacked Holocaust and genocide studies scholars who have written and talked about Israel’s genocide in Gaza, including me.\nThough the event was organized in honor of Yehuda Bauer, a founding figure of Holocaust studies who passed away on October 18, 2024, at the age of ninety-eight, the speakers barely mentioned Bauer or his work. Nor did they evaluate the mountain of evidence for the unfolding genocide in Gaza since October 7, 2023. Instead, they opted for outright genocide denial.\n(…)\nAs such, the attacks against Jewish scholars are part of the broader racist worldview of the speakers at the WGC event, aimed primarily at denigrating Palestinians.\nMost outrageously, the respondent Israeli historian Dan Michman, who serves as head of the International Institute for Holocaust Research at Yad Vashem, called in none other than Adolf Hitler to lend weight to the speakers’ attacks:\nNobody finds a problem with the term Palestinian. . . . But if you go back a century, to Mein Kampf, for instance . . . Hitler says at a certain point that the Zionists want to establish a Palestinian state in order to have a basis for their criminal activities. Now a Palestinian state a century ago was a Jewish state. And the fact is that during the [British] Mandate period in Palestine, the Jewish inhabitants were called Palestinian Jews, the Arabs were Palestinian Arabs. . . . In 1948, Israel was established, and the Palestinian Jews became Israelis, so the term [Palestinian] was left open, and only since the 1950s [do] we start to hear about Palestinians.\n(…)”\non the smearing:\n“(…)\nThose Jewish scholars are not alone, however. William Schabas, one of the most important international law experts on genocide who comes from a family of Holocaust survivors, explained in an interview at the end of November 2024 that\nin Gaza . . . the infrastructure has been massively destroyed, people have been unable to escape — and then there were the awful statements made by [former Israeli defense minister] Yoav Gallant. . . . Statements came from ministers, government spokespersons, and military leaders, all of whom have influence over the troops. They are more frequent and more serious than in any other case before [the International Court of Justice] that I am aware of. . . . Together with the hunger and the lack of access to water and hygiene, the systematic destruction of homes, schools, and hospitals, an image emerges that could be interpreted as being the result of genocidal intent.\nFor Rensmann, however, the “genocide claim [against Israel] is part and parcel of the history of twentieth- and now twenty-first-century antisemitism.”\nBuser built on Rensmann to wave away the Holocaust and genocide studies scholars, mostly Jews, whose work draws on the vast and growing body of sources on Israel’s genocide in Gaza.\n(…)”\nDon’t confuse the people with their government.\nI’m sure the Lebanese people don’t want this, but the reality is that their government is totally controlled by USA/Israel. Personally, I don’t see the situation in the UK as being much different, were ruled by puppets.\nMay be so but I reckon there have been more public protests, unrest in the western world than in 20+ arab nations combined (let alone dozens of muslim nations). Where are the big, subverting protest movement that one saw back in 2011 with the “Arab Spring” that actually made some arab leaders step down? It seems that westerners like us could only do so much because it does not matter if a western leader have to step down or if the opposition is elected because the pro-israel course will be the same but there could be a cataclysmic event if lets say the leader of Egypt, Jordan or Saudi were to be unseated. The arab world solely hold the key for change after the whole of the west abdicated and appease Israel no matter what. If the arab world do not raise their voice I fear one could write off that there will ever be a palestinian statehood, the palestinians people will become another ethnically cleansed group.\nIt will be telling to see the reaction of the saudi public when the saudi leaders will sign a normalization deal with israel coming months/year, that will be a critical lackmustest.\nWhilst True Reporters like Craig are Over in the War Zone..\nDeclassified Australia tells us how corrupt the MSM are – Though I’m not sure the Pope deserves a mention here –\nThe Australian mainstream media have failed abysmally to heed or answer the call to arms that the persecution of Mary Kostakidis represents, exactly as they did in the case of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\nIndeed, the silence of journalists of the Fourth Estate, combined with its affinity for the narratives of the rich and powerful, contributes to what seems to be a whole of government press-supported campaign to silence any voice critical of the official line.\nAnd as for Mary Kostakidis? If you assume, contrary to all of the evidence, that the Zionists taint her as anti-Semitic then she is in good company: apparently the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the U.N. secretary general, multiple U.N. rapporteurs, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Israeli Human Rights organisation B’Tselem, Israeli newspaper Haaretz and even the pope are too.\nBy Kellie Tranter\nDeclassified Australia\nHow the Israel Lobby Tries to Silence Criticism of Israel\nhttps://consortiumnews.com/2025/01/27/how-the-israel-lobby-tries-to-silence-criticism-of-israel/\nKellie Tranter is right. Zionists have indeed called the Pope “anti-Semitic”.\nhttps://www.jns.org/i-accuse-an-open-letter-to-pope-francis/\nhttps://religionnews.com/2024/10/10/popes-oct-7-letter-citing-antisemitic-verse-is-a-disaster-for-jewish-catholic-relations/\nhttps://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/rabbi-popes-words-on-israel-a-historic\nImportant background here:\n1. The idea that Jerusalem and the surrounding area (including Bethlehem) should form a “corpus separatum” under international guardianship is sometimes slagged by Zionists as being “the Vatican’s plan”.\n2. Actually it comes from the United Nations. This is why very few countries in the world recognise de jure Zionist sovereignty over *any* part of Jerusalem, even the western part of the city.\n3. If the Zionists attempt to “clear” the Palestinians out of East Jerusalem (which is very likely if they do the same on the West Bank), you can be absolutely certain that the Pope will condemn the Zionist action. They will of course call him anti-Semitic and just like Pius XII or even Hitler.\nIn this New video Craig and Team tell that Israel massacred 24 civilians attempting to return to their homes on the agreed date for the IDF to leave Lebanon, and shot and wounded 132 ..and have been AGAIN using banned White Phosphorus in Lebanon –\n18 mins –\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_k_IIFR8o\nThe white phosphorus comes from Yorkshire…. We are so complicit…\nIsraeli Major General Oded Basyuk walked about the streets of London and met with officials in secret – without even the slightest chance of him being arrested – even though he has played a major role in the genocide in Gaza.\nNot one major news outlet doorstepped this war criminal or even approached him or reported on the visit – only Declassified, doorstepped and questioned the war criminal but he fled. Its unlikely that any British PM would arrest any Zionist war criminals for genocide in Gaza.\n“Given that the ICC can issue arrest warrants in secret, and at short notice, how is Basyuk so confident that he can visit the UK without legal repercussions?\nFurther, Britain’s universal jurisdiction laws mean serious crimes can be prosecuted in the UK wherever they occurred, and separately from the ICC. A private application for his arrest could have been issued while he was here.\nThe only plausible answer is that the government of Keir Starmer gave him a gold-plated assurance that he would not be arrested under any circumstances during his visit.\nAs a signatory to the Rome Statute, it should be noted, Britain is legally obliged to enforce an arrest warrant issued by the ICC, though it has equivocated about whether in practice it would carry out an arrest of either Netanyahu or Gallant, if put to the test.”\nhttps://www.declassifieduk.org/israels-genocide-general-welcomed-in-london-and-the-media-yawns/\nMeanwhile.\nNo more neutrality for Switzerland – its now a Zio-Nazi supporting nation – which shuts down free speech against the genocide in Gaza.\nThe man has since been deported from Switzerland.\n“United Nations experts and social media activists have strongly denounced the arrest of a prominent Palestinian-American journalist in the Swiss city of Zurich, saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech in Western countries.\nSwiss Police arrested Ali Abunimah, who is the co-founder and executive director of pro-Palestine news outlet The Electronic Intifada (EI), on Saturday.\nAbunimah arrived at Zurich airport on Friday and was questioned by the police for an hour before being allowed to enter the Swiss city. He was arrested the following day ahead of a speaking event.\nPro-Palestinian advocacy group Swiss Action for Human Rights launched a petition to release Abunimah on Sunday.\nFrancesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied territories, in a post on the X social media platform voiced concerns over the state of freedom of expression and media freedom in Europe.”\nRe my above comment.\n“Mario Fehr, the Swiss security official who ordered the arrest of Ali Abunimah, is a rabidly pro-Zionist politician who falsely branded the Palestinian American journalist as “an Islamist Jew-hater.” In the past, Fehr has taken pride in banning Palestine solidarity demonstrations.”\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2025/01/28/swiss-official-journalist-ali-abunimah-pro-israel/\nSwitzerland has only ever been neutral in name only. They had a pretty poor record during WW2 when there was certainly cooperation with the nazis, particularly the German speaking areas. The banking system has also been very useful for depositing stolen loot, and just like Israel every adult in Switzerland is in the military. It’s a beautiful country, but if you live there you’d better conform or your life will be difficult.\nSwitzerland only became a big international\nmoney launderingbanking place when NYC-based Jewish mafia boss Meyer Lansky made arrangements for the Sicilian mafia (“Cosa Nostra”) to put their money there. That was after Luciano and Genovese took power from the “Moustache Petes” in 1931.The idea that Swiss banking goes back to the Knights Templar is nonsense.\nGot to admit that for a regime run for the benefit of international organised crime they’ve been quite effective at PR. They really sell on the “clean” thing, probably with greater success than their counterparts in the Dutch narco-state who sell on “pragmatic”.\nDidn’t they have slavery in agriculture (using children in “care”) until a few decades ago?\nSee the ban in most Swiss cantons on the building of minarets, portrayed by supporters of the ban as representing missiles aimed at white people:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Swiss_minaret_referendum\n“Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati strongly condemned the two strikes on Nabatieh and described them as a violation of the ceasefire arrangement with Israel.”\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrike-south-lebanons-nabatieh-injures-14-health-ministry-says-2025-01-28/\n“Strongly condemned” sigh, I do not know whether to laugh or cry about this ineptitude.\nWhat did the PM expect? Why did he sign a ceasefire-deal that did not deal with ceasefire-violations?\nNetanyahu invited by Trump to be the first foreign “leader” to visit the White House in his second term.\nThe invitation was made in a letter from the US president, which invited the Israeli prime minister to come to the White House on February 4th to “discuss how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbours, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries”.\n“It will be my honour to host you as my first foreign leader during my second term,” the letter read.\nMr Trump has said he is “not confident” that the ceasefire in Gaza will hold. Under the terms of the ceasefire, Israel and Hamas should soon commence negotiating a longer-term peace that many fear will fail and lead to a return to bloodshed following more than 15 months of fighting.\nhttps://archive.is/ZzNzh\nHe must have an awful lot of dirty laundry by now, those bloodstains are so difficult to remove.\nSymbolic value pushed by the israeli lobby and funders of Trump.\nAnd yeah Netanyahu will sure bring his laundry alright\nWashington Post: Israel’s Netanyahu brings his dirty laundry to Washington. Literally.\n“Over the years, the Israeli leader has developed a reputation among the staff at the U.S. president’s guesthouse for bringing special cargo on his trips to Washington: bags and suitcases full of dirty laundry, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter”.\nhttps://archive.is/K67pJ\nIt’s important to note that the Western media are complicit in these atrocities by suppressing news about them.\nHome page of the BBC: nothing.\nHome page of The Independent: nothing.\nHome page of Sky: nothing.\nHome page of The Guardian: nothing\nTo be fair, the Guardian does have a reasonable general article on the middle east:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/29/middle-east-donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-white-house-israel-gaza-latest-news-updates\nBut the detail of Craig’s report, the looting, the sickening contempt for Lebanese civilians institutionalised in the Israeli military, is essential to really understand what is going on.\nTo be fair, there wasn’t much room left after all the reports of weeping Royals yesterday.\nCraig’s superb, realistic and fearless reporting from south Lebanon’s hotspot, pointing out the IDF looting and massacring of civilians there, should be read from the pulpits and mosques alike every Friday and Sunday.\nIt should be read out at schools and universities.\nCraig should get an honorary doctorate in Palestinian and Lebanese genocide studies from Newcastle university, where the current lumpen media head-nodders were bred.\nThank you Craig Murray. What a swell job you are doing.\nBut foremost, take care of your own hide as well.\nThe world’s people need you.\nHumans are members of species homo sapiens so no one should be surprised to see individual homo sapiens or collectives of them engaging in normal homo sapiens behavior such as ethnic hygiene promotion, genocide pack rape slavery or torture. These are all perfectly normal homo sapiens behaviors but very few humans are able to detect them objectively. Members of species homo sapiens when viewing any other member of species homo sapiens first evaluate on what side of the US/THEM divide he or she is with respect to themselves and according to their choice judge that other’s behavior and character. Behavior by one of THEM can be judged criminal evil and immoral while the identical behavior by one of US is judged defensible, morally justified and warranted.\nSo killings and kidnappings by Hamas on October 7 2023 were criminal wicked and unjustified while the much greater killings of Palestinians are OK because justified to get at members or alleged members of Hamas in a crowd of others. If noncombatants get killed as collateral damage it is their fault for allowing a member of Hamas or one identified by a drone’s imprecise AI face recognition as a member of Hamas get too near them. If every remaining hostage taken on October 7 dies the total killed as a result will be less than 1500. Compare this to the 15,000 Palestinians killed in 1947-1948 to persuade 750,000 to flee. The killing of 15,000 was in two lots of about 7,500 the first by Zionist death squads led by future Israeli prime ministers to instil terror and the second in the actual Nakba to encourage those not wanting to test whether failing to flee would get him to be the second shot through the head as practical advice. 15,000 that 2% of the 750,000 who fled and is 10 October The sevenths. Compare the two and tell me which is the greater atrocity. in 1947-1948 The Zionists rid themselves of 765,000 Palestinians 15,000 dead and 750,000 expelled. In my opinion the dead were the lucky ones, the 750,000 and their descendants have spent 75 years stateless in squalid concentration camps in Nations which never gave them the rights of citizenship and no other nations have accepted them particularly those of the Euro-North American West who enabled the Zionist cause. Trump wants Egypt and Jordan to take them, surely Australia, Canada, Germany, France, New Zealand, The UK The US …. should accept them not the overcrowded and poor Arab countries who rightly fear being flooded with angrily and justifiably aggrieved refugees angry at these nations for cooperating in their expulsion.\nSince 1948 Zionists and Palestinians have been killing each other but the ratio of Palestinians killed by Zionists and Zionists killed by Palestinians has been 20:1. Lately post October 8 in the west bank the ratio has shifted to 50:1 and in Gaza we do not know because of hidden bodies buried in mass graves, ploughed under by IDF bulldozers or hidden under collapsed buildings. I expect it to be above 100,000 but we won’t find out because Netanyahu will recommence bombing as soon as the last hostage is freed.\nFact, International Law is null and void, always has been and always will be. Genocide has not been thought bad everywhere and every-when. It wasn’t bad when European colonists did it to the natives of the Western Hemisphere instead it was “Manifest Destiny” . It wasn’t bad when the Germans killed 40% of the inhabitants of South West Africa or when the Turks killed the Armenians. The Holocaust was only thought bad because the victims were white and Germany lost the war against the rest of the world that it had provoked. Had hostilities ended in an armistice rather than surrender or had The Axis won the Holocaust would have been thought nothing of any moment and except for the writings of a few Black Arm Band historians absent from most history books.\nTime has moved on since the second world war, the consensus now is that there are really are some groups of homo sapiens without whom the world would be more convenient for the people who matter. “Insert Latin word for Indigenous” delenda est. Indigenous people are incapable of adapting to modernity and neo-liberal policy. They are too attached to land and thus an obstacle in the way of Billionaires who could use it much more efficiently.\nThere are so many of them who need to be Holocausted, in Africa, Asia, Australia, India, Latin America, New Zealand, Oceania, West Papua….. and perhaps Mars.\nBillionaires don’t use anything efficiently: they got rich on the backs of others, they pollute and squander as they see fit and now they are pissing on the laws created that made them powerful and ignorant.\nmodernity leaving delenda est behind isa laughable assumption as modernity will eat itself and subsume those who have not realised that mammon is without nutrients to live on.\nYoga and mantras might enlighten the mind for a while, but nature is not manageable or there to be customed, it just is.\nThere is no higher meaning to life, except to get through it as best and amazing cable as one can.\nConfucius\nNevermind.\nObviously you do not believe in the foundational economic and political philosophy of The Euro North American empire aka Neo-liberalism. Obviously you scorn the wisdom of the West’s political giants such as John Winston Howard, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan. Obviously you do not appreciate the benefits off Margaret Thatcher’s privatization of inefficient Government monopolies such as Thames Water and Social Housing leading to magnificent economic and social benefits currently enjoyed by UK citizens!!!!!\nIt would presumably help if everyone was raised to identify their tribe as the human one, traced back to the first humans to evolve.\nIt’s interesting that despite Nazi eugenic ideology being used to discredit evolutionary insights, Israel apparently teaches evolution from at least secondary school i recall. Whereas e.g. Turkey has apparently removed it from even university.\nLast year I briefly spoke to a couple of ‘Jehovas Witnesses’ in London who had a sign about climate change, but didn’t believe in evolution. The young woman looked at me with pity for this belief, so brainwashed was she, while the older guy implied it was too complicated for the masses. Then a muslim guy came up behind me mockingly asking if i believed in evolution (how stupid for an obvious ape to be stood there in denial of being an ape). He aggressively refused to leave me alone so i left.\nThen again the prior year I was in the stupidly small human evolution section of the natural history museum, and there was a young couple who seemed to be at least culturally muslim and seemed at least interested in human evolution.\nThe Zio-Nazi’s will be livid at this – they probably thought their scorched earth policy would do the trick.\n“The Government Media Office of Gaza said on Wednesday that 80% of the displaced Palestinians have returned home in the north over the past few days.\nFor the third consecutive day, Palestinians have been traveling via the Rashid Road to reach the region.\nLocal media reports said the people carried whatever possible on the 7-kilometer route to Gaza City and the surrounding areas devastated by the barbaric Israeli bombardment.\nThe return home began in the wake of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel over the exchange of Israeli captives and Palestinian abductees.\nThe office said the available tents do not meet the needs of the returning Palestinians.\n“The number of tents that have entered the Strip is insufficient to meet the needs.”\nThe office highlighted a decline in the number of aid trucks entering, which contradicts the terms outlined in the ceasefire agreement.\n“Large quantities of aid are still stuck at the borders of the Gaza Strip.”",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2016_10_independent-scotland-will-need-new-capital_comment-page-2/content_19.html": "This is going to annoy a good many traditionalists, but here goes…\nEdinburgh is already the wealthiest and economically most successful city in Scotland. For the first time in 200 years it has overtaken Glasgow in population. Its housing is becoming prohibitively expensive for ordinary citizens. A two bedroom flat carved out of a converted house goes for £250,000 in a “normal” area. Three bed family homes are well over £350,000 in much of the city.\nIn any state, the capital sucks in economic resources from the rest of the country, because that is where the centre of government services lies. London currently absorbs an awful lot of Scottish taxpayers’ money, and the Treasury counts projects such as crossrail as a UK, not just English, benefit – a fact worth remembering when you look at GERS figures.\nAn independent Scotland will need new ministries of foreign affairs, defence, and immigration/security, and a much bigger ministry of finance. It will need a central bank. On top of which it will receive at least 60 foreign embassies and also, and often forgotten, about the same again in national offices of international institutions like the EU, World Bank, IMF, EBRD, etc. That also comes with an economic boom to supply all the needed accommodation and infrastructure.\nBut that is by no means all. Edinburgh is already a huge international finance sector. Insurance companies, fund managers and banks based in Edinburgh manage more assets than are held in the Paris, behind only London and Frankfurt in the EU. If the rest of the UK plunges out of the EU while Scotland stays in, where will be the obvious bolthole for financial institutions wishing to headquarter in a location which gives continued free access to EU markets, while minimising dislocation effects and need for new languages? Edinburgh.\nThat is not the only benefit which a Scotland still in the EU will gain from the new situation. The astonishing xenophobia south of the border is dictating a severe reduction in numbers of overseas students. If Scotland is independent and still in the EU, which English speaking destination with superb universities will those students go to instead? The continued expansion of the University and of student accommodation is already out of hand in Edinburgh city centre – this will get worse.\nThe truth is, post independence the economic boom which will hit Edinburgh will be more than the city can physically handle. It will be much more sensible to remove the public sector element – the functions and accretions of a capital city – to another destination.\nThis will shock traditionalists, but Edinburgh will always have its history and the tourists that come with it. There are older capitals available. Dunkeld of the Picts probably does not have enough available land. But Perth does, close to the ancient installation site of the rulers at Scone. Scone Palace would be a magnificent residence for Scotland’s President after Lizzie is given her marching orders.\nMany countries have moved to brand new capitals. My own choice of capital would be Dundee. The railway, road and airport connections already exist and the Caird Hall could be converted to a magnificent parliament. The seat of Scottish government is currently Ruth Davidson’s constituency – surely it would be much better to move it to Yes City.\nNice idea……\nAs you say, this will certainly annoy a few..!\nHopefully it will produce some intelligent, reasoned discussion as well……\nNot from Fred.\nNor Michael Norton.\nThis is fascinating and Dundee would be a great choice. It is also close to Arbroath so the Declaration of Independence and other important historical events would play well into making Dundee a good choice.\nMove the capital to Buckie after Indy.\nGlasgow met pop = 2.3 million\nEdinburgh met pop = 1.3 million\nIf you have a point, stop lying to try and prove it\nI was very interested in the various points you made: e.g. I had not realised how big the financial sector in Scotland is.\n…copied and pasted from a Guardian comments thread yesterday.

Or is he just trying to start a whole new argument in a divide and conquer type scenario. I don’t know where to begin in my opposition to this load of crap, infact I don’t want to give it any credence by putting forward a counter argument. The whole idea absurd.\nYes. You can say what you will about this blog, but it doesn’t tend to be a place for people with a sense of humour.\nCraig\nA very interesting and emotive subject to broach but I think you nailed it.\nWhy is it that the biggest/wealthiest city HAS to have the seat of government?\nIt brings a lump to my through and tear to my eye as a Scot abroad considering coming back IF Scotland can get itself together and rid itself of the binds of Unionism to the British throne and and parliament.\nThe very thought of Dundee or Perth becoming the governmental HQ (why not is the only response that I can come up with) would be a real draw for me and for those areas (geographically central and within reasonable distance to anywhere in Scotland) an absolute boon not to mention for those who were stationed there as those cities are neither oversized faceless metropoles and are less hectic and crazy fast than some other places.\nThis should be considered as a fresh start to a new (old) nation.\nWhy not have it in Shetland, after all it’s Scotland’s oil.\nHas Nicola gone too far with her Scottish twaddle?\nBut whereas the Prince left hundreds of dead clansmen on the field of Culloden before fleeing back to France, Sturgeon seems intent on impoverishing an entire nation of millions with her narrow-minded vision of Scotland and its place in the world.\nIt really is time for some straight talking about her SNP bluster. When Scotland joined the Union with England in 1707 it did so in large part because it was bust. A failed colonial investment had brought it to the brink of bankruptcy and desperate Scots wanted to link up with the more financially sound and successful economy south of its border.\nToday Scotland is in a worse economic situation than Greece – the basket case of continental Europe. But Sturgeon is determined to keep Scotland part of the EU despite the fact that it would now fail the stringent criteria to join the trading union. Germans would baulk at bailing out another irresponsible country living way beyond its means.\nhttp://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/725171/Nicola-Sturgeon-Bonnie-Prince-Charlie-act-comment\nBest twaddle off for your begging bowl then and be grateful that your prosperous neighbour (?!) looks after your financial needs. It appears that, in your eyes, Scotland is incapable of looking after their own affairs and will always be a charity case. If what you say is true, I’m surprised the Tories haven’t cut Scotland loose in their cost cutting reviews. Then again, they may have information that you are not party too.\nMichael , i think you should look at what really happened back then, we weren’t bust as you put it , and Scotlands hand was forced ( well the land owners) into a deal which the English brought about by stranding out fleet of ships at sea…there are reasons why it failed…We were pretty prosperous at the time\nThe value of Crude North Sea Oil is tanking.\nThink on.\nBegging bowl for you then?\nIt’s Glasgow or Edinburgh. No other city. And Edinburgh hasn’t yet overtaken Glasgow in population even at the level of city-proper. Edinburgh’s munipal population is short of 500,000 with a smaller urban population while the City of Glasgow is nearly 600,000 and the urban area is even bigger than that. The Scottish traditionalist in me says Edinburgh but the European traditionalist in me says Glasgow because with the exception of Switzerland the capital city of every sovereign European country bigger than a microstate is also the biggest city. I’m afraid I’m a traditionalist and I see nothing to be gained by moving the capital to Perth or Dundee certainly not from the perspective of someone in the south of the country. I say move the capital to Glasgow but keep some of the Goverment offices and the main judiciary in Edinburgh.\nSouth of Scotland or south of England, Eilif ? Edinburgh is only just in Scotland and there’s a lot more of the country further north than both cities. In any case, Perth is only 40 miles north of Edinburgh and 63 miles from Glasgow, and Dundee only 58 miles from Edinburgh and 81 miles from Glasgow. In all cases the road is a dual carriageway all the way!\nCraig\nThis is an interesting analysis and proposition. However, I would like to highlight an important factual error that many will find extraordinary and will no doubt contest. A diversion from the thrust of this article, but I think important nonetheless.\nI quote “London absorbs an awful lot of Scottish taxpayers’ money…”.\nAnalysis of government finances, in particular the consolidated balance sheet of HM Treasury and the Bank of England, demonstrates that when government spends it creates new money and that when tax payments are made money is extinguished. These important insights have long been known, but not widely known. They are not a matter of opinion or politics, but are a factual description of how government finance operates via standard accounting practices.\nThe consequences of these insights are that a monetarily sovereign central government like HM Government (not applicable to the Scottish Government, Local Government or the Eurozone) does not fund its spending from taxation and therefore is never revenue constrained. In fact, it has infinite spending power. It can never run out of money nor can it ever miss a payment, unless it chooses. Without HM Government spending first, there would be no money with which to pay taxes; HM Government must spend first before it can then levy taxes. So, London does NOT absorb Scottish taxpayers’ money and make it wealthier, for that is not how the system works.\nMainstream thinking is backwards and those on the Left should use these facts to attack the Government’s economic policies that are destroying the productive capacity of the British economy. Until the Left understands the reality of government financial operations it will always be complicit in the continuing destruction of the economy and the impoverishment of the many.\nFor those that are interested, a branch of macroeconomics known as ‘Modern Monetary Theory’ has this central idea at the core of its macroeconomic analysis.\nhttp://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/\nhttp://elliswinningham.net/\nhttp://neweconomicperspectives.org/money-banking\nFor the non-economists reading this blog, I’d just note that, just like there are a million people out there who each have their own theories about how 9/11 was a conspiracy, who did it, and why, there are also a seemingly endless mass of people who have weird theories about gold and/or money. Some of them are just creativity with definitions, like this one seems to be, but others are weirdly obsessive and outright strange. That way lies Ron Paul-style goldbuggism and a lot of other magic thinking.\nOh the myths abound, like the rumor that freshly printed currency is GIVEN to Banksters with no promissory note\n“a monetarily sovereign central government like HM Government.. does not fund its spending from taxation and therefore is never revenue constrained. In fact, it has infinite spending power”\nThat is true only if said sovereign government exercises its right to create its own currency. The UK government does not. It pays private banks to magic up new money, creating an unnecessary and ever-increasing burden of debt, which is great for the bankers but no-one else.\n[Shrug]\nEconomics is hard. Like quantum physics, it’s not the kind of thing that lay people should just spout off opinions about. It’s one of the enduring mysteries of our society why everyone thinks they can have an opinion about something that it took me more than a decade of hard study to vaguely master.\n(And, before you ask, the bit of economics I worked on is the stuff that Oliver Hart just won the Nobel Prize for, not monetary economics, which I’m only moderately more equipped to have an opinion about than the other commenters on this blog, given that I haven’t properly studied it since undergrad.)\nYou have no views on the financial system. No probs. Thanks for sharing.\nO, I have a view. My view is that you know less about it than I do, because I know enough to know what I don’t know, while you clearly do not.\nHow fascinating. Better not share your views then.\nDa steh ich nun, ich armer Tor!\nUnd bin so klug als wie zuvor;\nHeiße Magister, heiße Doktor gar\nUnd ziehe schon an die zehen Jahr\nHerauf, herab und quer und krumm\nMeine Schüler an der Nase herum.\nThat’s incorrect. Every time the government buys goods and services or makes a transfer, it creates new money. Every time a tax payment is made money is destroyed. Spending credits the reserve accounts of commercial banks at the Bank of England and the commercial banks then credit the payment recipient’s account with their own IOUs. Taxation reverses the spending process, debiting both the taxpayer’s account and the reserve account of the commercial bank. When tax payments are made the consolidated government balance sheet shrinks as the liabilities are extinguished. If spending is greater than taxation, then the government runs a deficit and the non-government sector can save this new money. If taxation is greater than spending, then the government runs a surplus and the non-government sector’s savings are destroyed. In order for the economy to operate at the same level of activity then the non-government sector must run down its savings and get into more debt.\nPrivate banks create their own IOUs (denominated in the government’s unit of account-the £) when they agree loans with their customers. They fund these loans with government money via the BOE in order to make interbank payments. In effect they leverage government money in order to make a profit. They are only permitted to create their own IOUs under licence by government.\nPlease stop talking about things you clearly don’t understand.\nRead Professor Wray’s primer on Modern Monetary Theory before dismissing my comments. It is a fascinating analysis of a modern fiat monetary system i.e. post Gold Standard/Bretton Woods:\nhttp://neweconomicperspectives.org/modern-monetary-theory-primer.html\nPass. I have no interest in going down some heterodox rabbit hole. A new one’s invented every day.\n“Every time the government buys goods and services or makes a transfer, it creates new money”\nOnly in the case of sovereign governments who create their own money. The UK has done this recently with QE (no goods or services bought, just shovelled straight into banks’ back pockets) but generally speaking it does not.\nActually every bank note in the UK is only an IOU for a 1lb in sterling silver unless my history is incorrect?\nWouldn’t count on it. If you take your bank notes to Threadneedle Street, they will give you other bank notes:\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/2-3/12\nDon’t you think it would be inconvenient to have the capital of Scotland in another country, halfway around the world?\n[Ducks and runs…]\nBetter weather though. Maybe not such a bad idea. 🙂\nWhat about fundemental public rights issues? Isn’t this more important to the people than where to put its capital city. Who cares! In Scotland people are being denied rights to public assets about which they are unaware.\nTake deer for one. They are a public assets but the law gives the sole shooting rights to landowners. Who (in general) neglect their duty to ensure enough ‘good’ stags and in doing so theres overpopulation with resulting land and herd impoverishment. Counts of deer numbers by Frank Fraser Darling and in the 50s and estimates by John Hunt in the 90s were suppressed. Heres part of a paper by Andy Wightman on Scottish Common goods assets.\nhttp://www.andywightman.com/docs/commongood_v3.pdf\nCommon good assets are the heritable (land and buildings) and moveable (paintings, furniture, chains of office etc.) property that belonged to the Burghs of Scotland. Under local government reform in 1975 Burghs and Town Councils were abolished and replaced by District and Regional Councils. In 1996 further reform introduced unitary authorities. Common good assets were subsumed within these local government reforms and placed under the stewardship of these new bodies. …The history of the common good over the centuries has been a history of wise stewardship followed by corruption, nepotism, cronyism and criminality. Today the situation is characterised by ignorance, bad record-keeping, impoverished funds, confusion and a continuing dose of cronyism, nepotism and evidence of occasional criminality.\nTake deer for one. They are a public assets\nYou wouldn’t by any chance be able to cite any authority for that proposition, would you?\nThey are certainly public assets when they wreck your car. Try locating a private owner of deer in those circumstances. A cow on the road on the other hand…\nThat seems more like an evidentiary problem than a problem of lack of ownership.\nA deer on a public road is a public asset. A deer on private land is an asset of whoever owns the hunting rights to that land.\nThanks, Fred, I knew that and should have been clearer in my post. The law is an ass and clearly designed to favour those who wish to have their cake and eat it.\nYes here: Chapter 3 Page 9 SNH Code of Practice on Deer Management\nhttp://www.snh.gov.uk/docs/B949709.pdf\n” In legal terms, wild deer belong to no-one but they can be taken by the owner of the land on which they are present. In a broader sense deer represent a shared resource for the people of Scotland and sustainable deer management involves balancing a range of interests”.\nDeliberate contadiction but thats a common in environmental legislation because these days its written to protect the polluter or in this case the body of people responsible for the environmental damage. Its a voluntary code only BTW\nThat doesn’t say that deer are a public asset, it says that they are a res nullius, just like the fish of the sea. They belong to no one until someone grabs them and in so doing establishes a property right. That is not the same as a town commons or the beach, which belong to the community, the crown, or whoever.\nIt also doesn’t explain why letting people hunt on their own land to the exclusion of others is a problem. After all, even if the deer were a public asset, that still wouldn’t mean that people could go onto private land to hunt without permission from the land owner.\nRubbish.\nDeer are nothing like the fish in the sea in terms of property rights. You are using a misleading comparison. Only the person owning the land upon which they stand has the right to shoot them. This is a right given by the law. Rights come with responsibilities and since before the first Red Deer Act 1959 these responsibilities have been shirked on a momumental scale … not only that but female numbers have been kept deliberately high under the false assumption that this will result in more stags and bigger revenues for the land owners and higher property values.\nThis has repercussions for all of society and the animals themselves. Trees do not grow where deer densities are too high (hence the ‘wet desert’ described by Fraser Darling), peat land is eroded releasing carbon and car drivers are killed in collisions. Deer in parks are much larger than the Scottish wild red deer. Population plasticity allows for more smaller and much weaker deer… on the edge of a population crash come a long cold snowy winter.\nWell yes, land rights ..and land ownership in Scotland is an even bigger scandal that makes talk of where to site the capital seem even more trite.\nI’m just restating what it says in the text that you put in your comment. A right to shoot deer is not the same thing as a property right. If the landowners owned the deer, they’d still own them after they left their property, which they clearly don’t, per your previous comment. “The deer belong to no-one”, as you said. Or, in fancy lawyer latin: res nullius. (Scots lawyers love latin, because they used to come to the continent to study Roman law, rather than study with the English in Oxbridge and London.)\nFor me it has to be Harthill or Larkhall – handy for the Motorway network and the locals would be tickled pink – they might even be persuaded to paint the pavements White and Blue!\nNot convinced Edinburgh has actually passed Glasgow in size, but it is growing and is certain to grow a lot more with independence. Yes, I do think there is a case for having a new capital. Perth has historic precedent, good road and rail links. But Dundee has history, an airport, and the Caird Hall.\nWhy does Scotland have to have *a* capital city? There has to be a nominal location for parliament (and to be honest, Edinburgh does fine for that, given that there is already a parliament building there), but surely pushing government functions and offices into the same location as the parliament is to repeat one of Westminster’s mistakes; too much focus on physical proximity to the “seat of power”…\nSurely we would be better to purposely and deliberately distribute government functions, ensuring that each part of Scotland receives some benefit from the jobs, general spending etc.? We are in an era of greatly enhanced tele-presence, and a fixation on urban centres for govt functions seems… outdated.\nOne key thing – you say a reason for choosing Dundee is… “The railway, road and airport connections already exist”. In my opinion, that’s a key reason for NOT putting it there; build somewhere where you can have the collateral effect of increasing the communications links for the area. Imagine how much work would be needed to improve connectivity to Campbeltown or Thurso if it were to become host to a major government function? and how much benefit and increased utility that would, in turn, bring to the Kintyre peninsula?\nWhat’s the point of starting a brand new country if we are not willing to think big?\nA question:\nIn this Scottish Fantasy, who will pay for this New Jerusalem?\nGiven I’m from Dundee, I may be biased in favour of your argument, although I did go to uni in Edinburgh. I couldn’t agree more, dundee has been neglected for the last 50 years by successive governments and suffered heavily from the deindustrialization of the 1980s, yet it is a fantastic city with so much potential for growth. I don’t know about the most current figures but Dundee has one of the highest unemployment rates in Scotland, 1/3 of people are unemployed. This kinda of idea could completely change the whole identify of the city for the better. What better way to reward the ‘yes city’ than by investing in its people and future.\nStrutting Sturgeon is to urge politicians, businesses and universities to join an “all-Scotland” coalition to oppose a so-called HARD BREXIT.\nStrutting Sturgeon said it was important to present a “unified Scottish position” on the issue to the United Kingdom government.\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37773224\nScottish fishing leaders are to hold separate meetings with the United Kingdom and Scottish governments in which they will argue that leaving the E.U. represents a ”sea of opportunity” for the industry.\nAgree with moving the capital to Glasgow to rebalance the distribution of wealth between the two cities. Edinburgh would risk becoming another London, sucking in all the investment and talent and leaving the rest of Scotland neglected. Edinburgh will always attract wealth regardless of whether it is the seat of government, because it has the finance and tourism industries. Glasgow’s the biggest, has been for 200 years, and should be the capital. It won’t happen, though, because in the short term it would cost too much and there will be too many other priorities\nWhy would you want a capital that’s facing in the wrong direction? Scotland has always had a strong European connection, which is why until 1800 or so the key ports were the North Sea ports, and particularly Edinburgh.\nYes here: Chapter 3 Page 9 SNH Code of Practice on Deer Management\nhttp://www.snh.gov.uk/docs/B949709.pdf\n” In legal terms, wild deer belong to no-one but they can be taken by the owner of the land on which they are present.

If, Scots need to cede some sovereignty to Brussels, so be it.\nIt could also be Washington and New York…\nThere are more people born in Scotland living in England than there are in either Edinburgh or Glasgow.\nWestminster is much closer to the Scots stretched out in Soho doorways smelling of piss than Edinburgh is.\n“Westminster is much closer to the Scots stretched out in Soho doorways smelling of piss than Edinburgh is.”\nAs if I needed anymore confirmation, that you’re a bigot.\nBrussels it is then.\nBrussels it is then.\nWhat about Sunny Banchory?

He already thinks he’s the king of scotland, so that would suit him fine…. We’re also very multicultural in Banchory.. At last count we had 3 chinese takeaways, 2 indians and an Italian, as well as an “American Diner” and a kebab shop…. Surely that’s enough to cater for the culinary whims of almost any parliamentary epicure. Tell them to steer clear of Skinners though, the menu hasn’t changed for 15 years.\nDundee would be fine as a stop gap, but I would personally favour a Highland capital. With all the money heading Scotlands way post independence, we could build it from scratch and set about righting the wrong of the clearances\nFurther north and closer to the resource wealth. Somewhere where there is enough land for an international airport and a major seaport.\nYou make some good points but I can’t agree with changing the capital from Edinburgh to anywhere else let alone Perth. I think the answer simply is to expand Edinburgh in terms of affordable housing and transport infrastructure. Currently the city lacks both these massively and should we withdraw from the UK and stay in the EU major investment in these areas will be needed. I think this way forward is the best one for Edinburgh and Scotland’s future.\nWell it was good enough for David Hume…\nBut aren’t you counting chickens before the rooster has finished his tasks?\nThe fact that the majority of Scots have no interest in being independent of the UK – even before they’ve been told the financial implications of joining the EU – is but a trifling matter.

Central, near the Highland border, could use some investment as much as anywhere else outside Glasborough, and a pretty good place to live.

Ideal.\nhttp://povertyalliance.org/userfiles/files/stirling_castle.jpg\nGlasburgh, no matter, in a similar fashion as McFayden and MacFayden, are both used widely in Scotland.\nApologies. I’ve been in England too long. And then there’s Middlesbrough.\nOh, and my impression is that although McThat and MacThat may be acceptable alternatives in general, the acceptability evaporates as far as the specific owner of one or the other is concerned. In less PC times, if you were a Mc in certain company, you ran the risk of being mocked as a tink, or Irish even. Hence my earlier correction of Mary to which you refer. Pure altruism, indeed.\nWe will discuss anything you put up of course, as your entourage.\nI still would like to know how Scotland will pay for a new Jerusalem, where will the actual money come from,\nanswers on a postcard.\nHaven’t you been following this thread? All money spent by the government is newly created money, so surely the government can spend as much as it likes?\n(Joking aside, the new Scottish central bank could create the money for the government to spend, but I’m not sure how such a Zimbabwe-approach would avoid the hyperinflation that resulted in, for instance, Zimbabwe.)\nA new capital for Scotland is a good argument against the EU and for a separate currency. Before UK was one state there were different currencies operating some based on areas and some by individual companies thus assisting local economies and was a de facto “protectionist” economic policy.\nWhen UK formed it has operated a ‘single currency’ and this helped draw the economy towards the south east, particularly following membership of and rules of EU and I’m sure progressing our financial rather than industrial sector was part of the membership deal.\nUK stayed out of Euro, but followed EU austerity and EU is suffering because of Euro, but belonging to Euro is part of the super-state project. In short moving the capital would just repeat the problem, but separate currencies would work better, but not allowed as full member of EU.\nWell, technically the pound Scots was pegged to the pound Sterling before the Act of Union, but I wouldn’t let that bother me if I were you.\nAn independent Scotland will need new ministries of foreign affairs, defence, and immigration/security, and a much bigger ministry of finance. It will need a central bank. On top of which it will receive at least 60 foreign embassies and also, and often forgotten, about the same again in national offices of international institutions like the EU, World Bank, IMF, EBRD, etc. That also comes with an economic boom to supply all the needed accommodation and infrastructure.\nI really do not see the need for Edinburgh to have all these government departments in an independent Scotland. Government departments should be moved around Scotland. Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Perth should definitely get more government departments. It would be crazy to get independence and then set up Edinburgh to be the new London. There is no reason for Glasgow not to have major governments departments/embassies/central bank, perhaps around 50 per cent, with the rest of the departments going to Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth etc. I would retain Edinburgh as capital city of Scotland, but under independence it should maybe only have a few minor government departments. As you say Craig, it already has the parliament and the financial sector, and many other tourist attractions as well.\nYou forget, in the UK (both in Westminster and in devolved governments), ministers are also members of the legislature. Therefore their ministries can’t be too far away from the legislature, otherwise the minister can’t be called in to vote on short notice. Personally I don’t think ministers should ever be allowed to be MPs/MSPs/whatever, but there you go.\nYour technical point doesn’t alter the substantial point about the benefits of operating a separate currency. The question becomes in what size State you wish to use it.\nHow will you Scottish people pay for all this by the way the arse is falling out of oil.\nYou may also find the arse is dropping out of banking.\nMuch like the arse fell out of jute.\nCompared to all the stuff a sovereign government has to pay for – benefits, an army, police force, tax collection, etc – a one-off purchase or lease of a couple of buildings isn’t going to break the bank.\nI thought they were suggesting they build a whole new World status City\nwith a World Status Airport\nand a World Status sea port, new high speed rail links and new motorways,\nNew Banking system – equivalent to the Bank of England, a New Jerusalem.\nI expect I am misunderstanding?\nSure, but I don’t think they were suggesting the Scottish government would pay for an entire city. That’s what private sector investment is for.\nYes, and there’s a whole field of economics that studies that question. It’s called Optimal Currency Area theory.\n(Unfortunately, applying it to Scotland and England is not straightforward. On the one hand they have high cross-border trade and presumably high labour mobility post-Scexit, on the other hand they have high asymmetry and low fiscal transfers.)\nWay ahead of yourself there Craig. Let’s be mindful of the present and get the job done first.\n#disappointed",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2025_04_syria-to-recognise-israel-by-end-2026/content_9.html": "A British diplomatic source tells me that “President” al-Jolani aka al-Sharaa has assured the UK that Syria will “normalise relations” with Israel, recognise the State of Israel and exchange ambassadors, by the end of 2026. This is part of a deal in exchange for substantial Western financial support and the lifting of sanctions on Syria.\nI asked whether the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Syria was part of the deal, and surprisingly this was not raised by either side. The UK regards it as a bilateral matter between Syria and Israel, and al-Jolani does not appear to prioritise Israeli withdrawal.\nI was also told that the European Union’s External Action Service (EEAS) and Directorate General for International Partnerships has decided that al-Jolani’s Syrian cabinet of ministers does meet the promises he gave to the EU Pledging Conference in Brussels on 17 March, through “foreign minister” al-Shibani, to form an inclusive government, specifically including Alaouite and Christian communities and also female ministers.\nThe conference pledged 5.5 billion euros to Syria in grants and loans, half of it from the EU itself. The condition of an inclusive government was stressed by the EU in its public statements.\nSubsequently on 27 March al-Jolani announced his “inclusive” cabinet of 24 ministers. There are 21 male Sunnis, including all the key posts – Finance, Interior, Defence, Foreign Affairs. There is just one woman, who is also the token Christian (and is Canadian). There are three minority representatives, all in minor ministries – one Christian, one Alaouite, one Druze. There is no Shia representation. One of the Sunni ministers is a Kurd.\nI am sure when you look at this image, like the EU you immediately think “oh good, a diverse cabinet”.\nThat this is an “inclusive” government is a farce – only the most flimsy nod to tokenism detracts from the fact that it is a Sunni regime with strong theocratic leanings. It was German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock who made the most public song and dance in Brussels about the need for an inclusive government, yet it is she as one of a triumvirate of women – along with EU Commission President von der Leyen and external affairs head Kaja Kallas – who has insisted that al-Jolani’s cabinet is acceptable.\nOf course, al-Jolani’s pro-Israeli credentials trump every other consideration.\nThis has caused much disquiet among staff at the EU External Affairs Service and there is enormous discontent at the blatant pro-Israeli agenda of von der Leyen in particular. The playing down of massacres of minorities in Syria, on top of the genocide in Gaza, is causing real concern both in the EU and within the UK at the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, my old department.\nA final snippet from my source. Al-Jolani has the support of both MI6 and UK special forces within Syria. A key part of their role is to guard against any potential revolt by his own militants who fought their way through from Idlib.\nChechen, Uzbek and Uighur militants are very happy for now with the spoils of victory, but may not take kindly to the notion of recognising Israel.\nTo be clear, this next did not come from my diplomatic source. But I strongly suspect that the game is for al-Jolani and his pro-Zionist regime, installed with Western backing, to strengthen its paid forces until the time comes for a night of the long knives, where al-Jolani’s own most fanatical supporters will be eliminated. That however is merely my reading of his most practical next step. I do not see how he is to reconcile the roles of Islamic fundamentalist and US/Israeli puppet otherwise.\nThis game is not over yet.\n———————————\nMy reporting and advocacy work has no source of finance at all other than your contributions to keep us going.

Christianity has St Aquinas’ doctrine of the Just War and Islam has Jihad. The centralised authority of the Christian denominations makes achieving a consensus position more likely (in theory) than in Islam. The theological reticence in engaging with the Genocide demonstrates an ecumenical avoidance or retreat from the starkest (and darkest) episode (18 months and counting) of indiscriminate murderous inhumanity. If the organised religions present themselves as powerless and without authority then increasingly Marx’s dicta will be seen to apply evermore clearly on this corporeal plane. The power of organised religion’s to mobilise unequivocal consensus and action in response to future moral panic will be denuded as organised religions will not be seen as a rallying point to address the demands of social justice given their quiescence over the Genocide.\nJohnnyOh45 and Jack. You both pose good questions, here is how two statesmen thought about them…..\nThe “Blood and Iron” speech, given by Otto von Bismarck in 1862, is famous for its assertion that major political issues are resolved not through diplomacy and debate, but through military force. And Mao Tse-tung said in “On Protracted War” (May 1938) that “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun”. This quote is often used to emphasize the importance of military power in achieving political goals.\nThe Orange b——d seems to be trying to emulate Bismark and Mao with regard to both Iran and Yemen…\nNine plane loads of bunker-busting bombs were shipped from the US to Israel. The munitions are intended to prepare Israel for a potential war with Iran.\n“Nine US transport planes carrying bunker-busting bombs and other defensive weapons landed at Nevatim Airbase near Tel Aviv, in central Israel,” the Israeli broadcasting authority KAN reported. The outlet noted that Washington also sent additional interceptors for the THAAD air defense system to Tel Aviv. https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/eye-iran-us-sends-bunker-busting-bombs-israel\nTrump’s opening gambit is no uranium enrichment, no ballistic missiles and no fraternizing with other members of the ‘arc of resistance’. Good luck with those impossible demands.\nReports indicate that Iran is very open to curtailing its uranium enrichment programme and supporting international monitoring (as it previously did under JCPOA) BUT it requires the USA, and its puppets, to relax sanctions.\nIMO this won’t happen, and Iran is being set up to fail – to quench the blood lust of Israel.\nThank Harry.\nReligion has always been useful to provide people with the courage to face death and this is why political patrons have allied with it due to its utility in military conflict. The Mao quote expresses the view that violence can be utilised legitimately to aid revolution.\nA decade following the Korean War, China obtained nuclear deterrence.\nInterestingly as Ambassador Charles Freeman observed both Communist China and the USA are revolutionary in origin.\nIran too is a revolutionary state although in principle a theocratic one with democratic features. Interestingly it is this theological state that is opposing Israel on principle and its fatwa against nuclear weapons is premised on the theological unacceptability of mass civilian casualties (as part of God’s creation and a violation of the sanctity of life). That a theological non-secular state should have a clear and cohesive position on these issues while the allegedly rationale secular states embroil themselves in Genocide and have weapons of mass destruction illustrates what can only be politely described as ambivalences given the rhetoric coming from western countries about their professed values.\nIt also worth noting that Yemen a country with a low GDP, limited mass media and internet accessibility have maintained solidarity with Palestine. It would be difficult to make the argument that Yemen’s populace are prey to the scourge of misinformation which so exercises our own western governments and policy makers.\n“its fatwa against nuclear weapons is premised on the theological unacceptability of mass civilian casualties (as part of God’s creation and a violation of the sanctity of life)”. The word is Haram (forbidden) however a volley of ballistic missiles may, (probably would) achieve the same mass casualties. I did hear that if Israel did attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, then Iran would quickly obtain the bomb. My question is, why wait to be attacked? Possession of the bomb could act as a deterrent even if not used? Mutually assured destruction, keeps the peace (sort of) between super powers.\nWith the Iranian missile capability there is at least an element of intent insofar as targeting combatants is concerned. The reason why Genocide is a moral crime is that the group is targeted and attacked on the basis of their being in a group whether they are a civilian or combatant and is therefore indiscriminate on this basis.\nA jesuitical out for Iran could be to sign a defence treaty with Russia thereby guaranteeing a nuclear response from Russia from any attack on Iran ( a la NATO) however the price Russia would want to exact for this may be too high ? Also, as you point out, Iran’s conventional missile technology is capable of destroying Israel and any other belligerent neighbouring states.\nIn a multi-polar world the best form of security is peace and this needs to be worked for, earned and maintained. A regional war with Iran would be devastating. The calculation for the US is whether it can afford to insulate itself from the impact of a regional war and if it would tolerate sacrificing Israel to achieve this ? If not the alternative is managed decline with the risk its proxy Israel unilaterally attacks a major power thereby forcing the US to disengage or engage.\nThe irony in this issue is that Israel is a nuclear state and therefore has real deterrence from unprovoked attack, which ought to leave it feeling secure. However, as the exception which proves the rule, Israel claims that it is being assailed by enemies on all side while it is Israel itself that is illegally occupying its adjacent neighbours land and routinely violates their sovereignty.\nThere appears to be a lot shuttle diplomacy at the moment between many of the relevant actors and large powers. Creating peace between Ukraine and Russia so the US can support an attack on Iran is probably not in the interest of BRICS.\nJohnnyOh45, thanks for the thoughtful reply, these are difficult questions and as everyone knows when the bombs drop International law goes out the window. In WW2 Germany bombed UK cities and we bombed German cities, some with no military importance, Dresden was firebombed with tremendous loss of civilian life. Also 2 Japanese cities nuked. There is nothing moral or legal in any of these three instances, unfortunately this is the world we live in, make no mistake no one is going to be the first to give up its nuclear weapons, but they do have deter ant value.\nThis is clearly not a very good time to pontificate about anything, if you see what I mean!\nRegarding organized religions, they probably differ a lot from spontaneous religions, if there’s any of this kind.\nWe all respect Bismarck and Chairman Mao, but still…\nWe’re rather far from Syria by now, but hopefully we’ll soon get back on track.\nThanks to Craig!\nMelrose.\nIn The Golden Olden Days of the Tribe no-one had any time for all the religious stuff.\nThe main aim was to find food one way or another.\nthat way daily life – survival.\nThen along came a surplus ( due to farming and husbandry) and as soon as that appeared\nthe Sages/Gurus/ Shamen appeared.\nBecause they had a a surplus and herding was helpful to that you only had to hunt every X\nnumber of days and could have the weekend off ( weekends hadn’t been invented yet).\nThis is where the basis of religion comes from because it enabled the ‘thinkers ‘ to think and\nnot bother themselves with such small matters as survival of the Tribe.\nThey could then hand down that thinking ( philosophy) down to the rest of the tribe.\nAnd so it began etc etc.\nThey still walk among us today with other Spiritual guides on the net ( known as influencers) and\nof course usual religion so nothing really changes – does it?\nOf course you have to remember that normally the one’s who issue the edicts and rules do not do\nthe work and in the case of war don’t do the fighting.\nJust the ordering.\nI am not religious at all but despite that I like the ordinary believers, but not the people they believe in.\nIf they are poor even more so, as Heaven is their only hope relative to the world they currently exist in.\nThe Rich believe they can buy their way into Heaven – which tells you more about their belief in their\nGod as a reflection of themselves more than anything.\nIn fact it would be interesting for the Israeli Armageddonists to know where their money is parked up\nas an act of faith.\nThat would certainly be a test of where their faith lies.\nVis- Iran:\nFor the US and Israel to think that Iran will dis-arm to allow the two countries to attack them is\nprobably the most preposterous idea so far from Trump and Netanyahu.\nIn Iraq it worked – in Iran it won’t.\nWow. I am totally dumbfounded by your extremely insightful analysis.\nSo Mr Cutts, in your opinion will the next Pope be African or American?\nAfrican Christianity? OMG!!\nI mean I’m sure there must be good people, like Francis or Rowan in the Church’s hierarchy in Africa. I mean I hope there are.\nI think we understand how our CofE version came about. It was not just the way a certain king was able to divorce an unwanted wife, it was the outcome of the philosophical debates across Europe of the Renaissance. Anne Boleyn brought great learning from the Court of King Francis, where Leonardo da Vinci ended his days. The intertwining of religion and state was underpinned with profound scientific and alchemical learning, and this learning was only possible due to a surplus of wealth, achieved from organised and stratified distribution of labour and formal class relationships.\nAfrica, not being an island or an empire, does not have unifying philosophical debate, but is in constant flux, with strength as the denominating factor. Buy a local paper somewhere in Nigeria or wherever and see how the Christian priests focus on beating demons out of people, mostly women and children. The old witch doctor hierarchies of power have integrated into grafted on colonial Christianity. Fear and violence have formalised roles alongside the happy clappy swaying and ecstatic singing. And Africa is big. Its natural resources are huge. China is very integrated, despite its difficulty finding people to sign formal agreements with, to their wealth extraction, who actually have any influence on the ground or territories in question, or who can found when it transpires that nobody in the area has any idea who they are or where the money paid has vanished to.\nGlobalism is markets and they are being exposed in quantum entanglement….\nPope Francis has been a fine, unifying, pope. The world is on the brink of profound upheaval.\nMelrose.\nNot sure the new ‘ Woke ‘ Catholic Church is ready for that.\nAbout as much chance of that happening as a Jewish person joining a WASP run Golf Club in the US.\nYou may have a big surprise when they say habeus papam.\n“Of course you have to remember that normally the one’s who issue the edicts and rules do not do\nthe work and in the case of war don’t do the fighting.”\nThat is a relatively recent thing. The last English king to lead his troops into battle was as late as George II.\nThe latest UK task force led by the £3.5 billion pound aircraft carrier Prince of Wales has just left Portsmouth on a willy waving expedition to the South China seas hopefully to traverse the Taiwan Strait [poke the panda] What could possibly go wrong? Here’s one thought, the last Prince of Wales [a battleship] along with the repulse was sunk by Japanese aircraft early in WW2 in the South China Sea. Now the Chinese have unstoppable Mark 10 velocity hypersonic ballistic missiles, which US defence Sec said are capable of sinking all US aircraft carriers in 20 minutes. This task force will go through the Suez canal and sail up the Red sea, what? Methinks the Houthis will remember who bombed them recently. The bombastic UK leadership led by Starmer still thinks we rule the world, they all quote the .Rules based International order. boy are they in for a rude awakening?\nMach 10, ssshurely?\nThank you Glenn-nl but you must admit it does sound the same, rather like one of the carry on cast calling her cat… ‘cooking fat’ when ejecting it from her room. ‘carry on loving’ [smirk]\nHere is an extract from an article from 2009 by the war nerd, it is Humorous and correct in the implications for aircraft carriers. Since then missiles are now so much more sophisticated and also hyper sonic.\nRemember that one sentence, get it branded onto your arm: “Ships currently have no defense against a ballistic missile attack.” What does that tell you about the distinguished gentlemen with all the ribbons on their chest who’ve been standing up on carrier bridges looking like they know what they’re doing for the past 50 years? They’re either stupid or so sleazy they’re willing to make a career commanding ships they know, goddamn well know, are floating coffins for thousands of ranks and dozens of the most expensive goldplated airplanes in the history of the world. You call that patriotic? I’d hang them all.\nThat’s why it’s so sickening to read shit like the following:\n“The purpose of the Navy,” Vice Admiral John Bird, commander of the Seventh Fleet, tells me, “is not to fight.” The mere presence of the Navy should suffice, he argues, to dissuade any attack or attempt to destabilize the region. From Yokosuka, Guam, and Honolulu, the Navy is sending its ships on missions to locales as far away as Madagascar. On board the Blue Ridge, the vice admiral’s command ship anchored at Yokosuka, huge display screens allow officers to track the movements of any country’s military vessels cruising from the international date line in the east to the African coast in the west—the range of the Seventh Fleet’s zone of influence.\nThat’s the kind of story people are still writing. It’s so stupid, that first line, I won’t even bother with it: “The purpose of the Navy is not to fight.” No kidding. The Seventh Fleet covers the area included in that 2000 km range for the new Chinese anti-ship weapons, so I guess it’s a good thing they’re not there to fight.\nStories like this were all over the place in the last days of the British Empire. For some dumbass reason, these reporters love the Navy. They were waving flags and feeling good about things when the Repulse and the Prince of Wales steamed out with no air cover to oppose Japanese landings. Afterward, when both ships were lying on the sea floor, nobody wanted to talk about it much. What I mean to say here is, don’t be fooled by the happy talk. That’s the lesson from GM, Chrysler and the Navy: these people don’t know shit. And they don’t fucking care either. They’re going to ride the system and hope it lasts long enough to see them retire to a house by a golf course, get their daughters married and buy a nice plot in an upscale cemetery. They could give a damn what happens to the rest of us.\nhttp://exiledonline.com/the-war-nerd-this-is-how-the-carriers-will-die/all/1/\nReading stuff from the last 2 wars the tragedy and heartbreak need reminding. Was it Kitchener who oversaw the loss of the British Navy in the Dardanelles?\nAnd Siegfried Sassoon’s autobiographical novel: fox hunting in Ireland after 1916, a turn in Palestine reading the Woodlanders, while marching past dejected Turkish prisoners and lots of dead camels, and then reading War and Peace while billeted in a French village overlooking a churchyard. The perfect good manners, the cheerful bravery of the conscripted men writing letters of longing to their wives and mothers, the unpleasantness of practicing bayonet charges against straw men, and…. I only have a few pages left and Ypres is 3 miles away.\nComparing that church going population of rural and industrial Britain and Ireland, with the horrors faced by millions of conscripts across Europe and North Africa, and I can only wonder where the voices of today’s soldiers and sailors will be written and who will read them.\nGood for Harry going to visit the wounded soldiers in Ukraine, looking to make sure they are not forgotten, and that their stories can be heard, and how can they return to civilian life after what they have seen – and done.\nChina has made 3D printing into a force for colonising the moon and terraforming Mars. It builds motorways several miles high to cross chasms and burrow through mountains. The giant machinery just gets refilled with steel and concrete and clicks it all together before moving forward. China’s Navy has ships as big as islands and these ships are carrying 3D printing capacity to build roads and bridges to join the ships to Taiwan’s mainland, to unload millions of soldiers. We have no concept of scale and our aircraft carriers don’t even work properly.\nCharging our students massive debt to do tightly prescribed degrees which don’t allow them to question the focus of their prescribed studies leaves us at a disadvantage. China has invested massively in sending its students to universities around the world. We have a thousand in each university every year, and they report back on everything.\nWe have no concept of the difference of scale.\nSeveral years ago when news channels around the world were free to view, I watched a Chinese Studies spokesman from SOAS tell the interviewer on one of the English speaking China News channels ‘China will invade Taiwan at a time of its choosing.’ ‘And Japan?’ Asked the interviewer. The question was left hanging. It was a sobering revelation\n> “The purpose of the Navy,” Vice Admiral John Bird, commander of the Seventh Fleet, tells me, “is not to fight.”\nAh yes, very reminiscent of his TV namesake – who, coincidentally, portrayed an Admiral asked to explain the point of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS\nCamilla Parker-BowlesQueen Elizabeth. John Fortune persistently asks him “And what are they for?”, while Bird keeps avoiding the question, eventually admitting that the ships can’t be deployed for a military purpose – before suggesting that, as they could hold 12 Olympic-sized swimming pools, they might be better off being used for hosting the Games.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0jgZKV4N_A\nMaybe we’re going to challenge the Chinese to a swimming competition? A swim-off to decide the fate of Taiwan would at least have the benefit of fewer casualties. Speedos at the ready, then ….\nThe Russian Navy lost a lot of its aristocratic Dukes and Counts in its sea battles against Japan over disputed Kuril Islands in 1912. The leadership of large parts of Feudal Russia were lost.\nLenin, Marx, Trotsky and Engels stepped in to fill the void.\nThe, so called, Ministry of Defence (MoD) is an incompetent and corrupt organisation. If the ‘defence’ of the UK relies on these incompetent crooks then we are truly f*cked. Every project that comes out of the MoD is late, over budget and not fit for purpose.\nThe carriers are a perfect example; they were going to be nuclear but now are diesel and have to be followed around by a tanker; they were going to have catapults but then went VTOL but have no planes as we gave all ours away to the USA; there are two carriers but one is essentially a spares backup; The UK cannot supply an (essential) carrier defence force so we rely on other nations. The carriers cost a fortune but wouldn’t last longer than 60 minutes in any serious engagement. The MoD foisted this sh*t on the nation.\nJust rewatched the story of Britain’s nuclear bomb and the tests in Australia “Britain’s Nuclear Bomb Scandal: Our Story” on the BBC: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00257rk\nWatch this and see what the MoD is really like – evil.\n“This task force will go through the Suez canal and sail up the Red sea, what?”\nAre you sure that HMS Prince of Wales can fit down the Suez canal? Mind you, it will probably break down before it gets much further than Gibraltar.\nHMS Prince of Wales will conduct joint exercises off France, then transit into the Mediterranean for more drills with the Italian Navy. After this workup, she will transit the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, bound for points east. It is as-yet unknown whether or how much she will be involved in the U.S. bombing campaign over Yemen during the transit; British forces have participated in the effort before, but the operation has intensified and its scope has broadened under the current U.S. administration.\nhttps://maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-carrier-departs-on-eight-month-deployment#:~:text=Published%20Apr%2022%2C%202025%2011%3A29%20PM%20by%20The,fighters%20-%20all%20the%20way%20to%20the%20Pacific.\nBrian Berletic points out some inconvenient facts regarding US/China relations and Taiwan, the fact that the US is arming Taiwan to the teeth augurs badly for the future, because the US could use Taiwan as a proxy, just like Ukraine, this would be fatal to the Taiwanese, I hope they realize where their future belongs. Just a hint of what motivates the US is Trump bragging about the major Taiwanese chip manufacturer building a $100 billion dollar factory in Texas. Here is the US cleverly covering all bases, ready to throw Taiwan under the bus, just like Ukraine, will the vassals never learn or, as H Kissinger once said It may be dangerous to be America’s enemy, but to be America’s friend is fatal.\n“The US State Department, upon its own official website under a section titled, “U.S. Relations With Taiwan,” unambiguously admits, “we do not support Taiwan independence.”\nIf the US government does not recognize or support Taiwan independence, by implication Taiwan is a “dependent” of another state. According to the United States’ own “One China” policy laid out in the 1972 Shanghai Communique, that state is China, whose sole legitimate government is the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\nThe 1972 document explains in detail:\nThe United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position.\nThus, any interaction between Taiwan and the rest of China is a matter of Chinese internal political affairs, amid which the US has no ability to interfere in accordance with international law and more specifically, under the UN Charter and its guarantee of a nation’s territorial integrity and political independence.\nThe UN Charter says unequivocally:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\nQuite clearly Washington’s unofficial support for separatism in Taiwan, in contradiction of its own agreements with Beijing regarding the status of the island province, is a violation of international law to begin with. Any plans by the US to use any kind of military force, including unmanned systems, to intervene in China’s internal political affairs, begins from an entirely flawed, indefensible position under international law”. https://orinocotribune.com/why-washingtons-plans-to-turn-taiwan-strait-into-hellscape-are-fundamentally-flawed/\n” US-sponsored separatism and other violations of Chinese sovereignty over the island province of Taiwan ”\nOh and what of the right to self-determination of the Taiwanese? I don’t see that mentioned anywhere. Is that an ‘inconvenient truth’ Berletic can’t deal with?\nNot all parts of nations are compatible with the right to self determination, the Spanish parliament refuses Catalonian independence, so it seems their right to self determination can only be realized with massive civil disobedience culminating in a civil war. Similarly Mebyon Kernow the Cornish Nationalist party would not be allowed self determination for the same reasons. There are many nascent independence movements in Europe, I suspect the reason Catalonia did not receive support from the EU was the fear such support could open a Pandora’s box opening the door to civil and military strife all over Europe. Jeffrey Sachs appeals to the Taiwanese not to trust the US, they will get you into trouble…\nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-03-24/The-U-S-won-t-protect-Taiwan-it-only-endangers-it-1C0vGfp98rK/p.html\nThis is sound and logical advice, China population 1.4 billion versus Taiwan 20 million half of whom do not want independence, Taiwan is 80 miles from mainland China. The Chinese army is so large they are told not to march in lockstep because if they did the earth might fall off its axis. Most Taiwanese trade is with China, the US want to use Taiwan as a proxy, don’t let them.\nThe UN would disagree.\nArticle 1\n1. All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.\n2. All peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic co-operation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law. In no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence.\nThe theory is wonderful but realpolitik i.e, Realpolitik from German real ‘realistic, practical, actual’ and Politik ‘politics’) is the approach of conducting diplomatic or political policies based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than strictly following ideological, moral, or ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism. Sure they can go for independence, but no major power will back them up, even the US agrees that there is only one China and will not go to war with China over it., that is guaranteed.\nPears Morgaine.\nWould you like to have a chat with The Palestinians about Rules and Laws\nand throw in Iraq- Libya – Syria and so on?\nI’m not saying the rules don’t exist but, as usual with Laws and rules it depends\non their application.\nMore to the point, it depends on who’s doing the ignoring.\nAs the saying goes: ‘Rules are there to be broken’\nComes down to (as it always does) who is the most powerful ignorer and who is the prosecutor.\np.s. As far as I am aware Taiwan is considered as part of China by the UN and even the US tacitly\ntalk about One China.\nPerhaps some better informed commentators on here can put us both on the right track as to\nthose ‘ Rules?’\nMR MARK CUTTS, you requested an opinion on the new rules, in this article ‘the case for dismantling the rules-based International order’ Professor Glenn Diesen explains everything, I regard him as an excellent commentator on current world affairs. https://alethonews.com/2024/12/24/the-case-for-dismantling-the-rules-based-international-order/\nAmerican bluff. Taiwan is not Ukraine, it’s an island far from anywhere but China, The supply lines are not defensible, so any military action is doomed to failure. A large percentage of Taiwanese do not support their USA funded government and all Taiwanese see themselves as Chinese. There are many political and social interactions between Taiwan and China. The west has nothing to offer Taiwan apart from war, death and destruction. Hong Kong should act as an example of the west’s duplicity.\nAny military action is going to be initiated by China. They know they can’t subjugate Taiwan by any other means. Increasing numbers in Taiwan are identifying as Taiwanese, not Chinese, and whilst there might not be 100% support for the US, support for unification with China is very, very much lower. Hong Kong acts an example of Chinese duplicity and brutal suppression.\nFor once I agree with you Pears. Hong Kong was and still is suffering oppression and restrictions of liberty, and Taiwan is more ethnically and culturally mixed at this time. Its economy is successful and losing autonomy under occupation will be awful for the people. America will try and protect its industries and financial interests.\nThere are none so blind as those who will not see !\nAs you unwittingly state: “America always protects its own interests”. Taiwan means nothing to America other than a means to destabilise China, similarly with Hong Kong. And exactly the same with Ukraine and Russia as with Afghanistan and Russia.\nHonestly, can you not see this ? How many people have to die before your eyes open ?\n“Any military action is going to be initiated by China. They know they can’t subjugate Taiwan by any other means.”\nThey don’t need to subjugate Taiwan. All they need and want to do is to stop the US meddling in Taiwan’s affairs. The US doesn’t give a shit about Article 1 unless it suits their interests.\nBayard\nFrom what I’ve read i the US has told the Taiwanese Government that if China invades they must sabotage all their hi -tech chips and other tech items.\nIn other words anything that would give the Chinese an edge over the US must be destroyed and nothing to do with democracy or sovereignty – just business.\nChina may just blockade the country and dare the US to come near.\nIf the US thought the Yemenis were a pain in the backside China could easily outdo their achievements.\n“From what I’ve read i the US has told the Taiwanese Government that if China invades they must sabotage all their hi -tech chips and other tech items.”\nExactly, either Taiwan is a sovereign nation in which case what do the Americans think they are doing ordering it around like that, or it is a quasi-colony of the US, in which case the PRC has every right to feel aggrieved about US involvement. I wonder how the US would react if China started ordering Puerto Rico about in the same way.\nAll Taiwanese see themselves as Chinese? According to Pew Research, “Most people in Taiwan see themselves as primarily Taiwanese; few say they’re primarily Chinese”. 67% think of themselves as primarily Taiwanese; only 3% see themselves as primarily Chinese. 85% say they are NOT emotionally attached to China.\nPew ! I detect a whiff of evangelical Christians with a smattering of zionism and a side of security.\nApparently, 99% of statistics are made up. 🙂\nSo, there is no way to convince you otherwise? Even if I show you a video of some Taiwanese voicing their opinions, you can simply say that it’s merely anecdotal evidence, right? Please tell me, then, what real hard evidence looks like to you, aside from what YOU think?\nEven without evidence, it’s just common sense to assume that a group of people living on their own island will create their own culture and identity and slowly drift away from their ancestral roots. That, after all, is what the British who were sent to penal colonies in Australia did, did they not? It’s also what a particular type of pigeon did after it got stranded on the island of Mauritius – it evolved into the dodo and stopped mixing with regular pigeons.\nB: So, there is no way to convince you otherwise?\nOne thing to appreciate about SB is that he “knows” things. No evidence is needed, no proof required. He just “knows”, you see.\nIt’s a silly question, though – “Do you see yourself as primarily Chinese or primarily Taiwanese?” At least 95% of residents of Taiwan are Han Chinese. You can find Chinese people from Hong Kong too who will talk about China or “the country” meaning mainland China – or more precisely the area under the People’s Republic of China – but even if they speak that way they will still call themselves Chinese and acknowledge that Hong Kong is in China.\nThose interested in the demographics of Taiwan rather than just having an argument may also like to take account of the existence of the indigenous people of Taiwan, formerly called Taiwanese aborigines – who have been subject to oppression that can be compared with the oppression of other indigenous peoples elsewhere in the world.\nIt’s curious how British government media has a stock way of saying (this is from memory) that the Beijing government “views Taiwan as a renegade province” whereas the Taipei govenment “views Taiwan as a country in its own right” – a summary which is basically a crock of shit, because both governments have a “One China” policy. But for some reason it must suit the British Foreign Office, although I’m not sure why.\nAnother thing is that when western media report things such as that the wicked Beijing forces have flown military aircraft into the heroic Taiwan government’s air security zone a total of 73 times over the past 17 days, they omit to mention that the said zone actually includes a large chunk of mainland territory administered by the PRC.\nBut of course it’s possible to read too much into this. Doubtless some prats at the Foreign Office who think they’re true understanders of fuzzywuzzies’ minds have decided they’re going to lay down a line that, sure, such-and-such an amount of “face” is okay but the poshos gotta enforce some kinda limit on it. In reality, the British rulers have absolutely f*ck all influence in the region, so it doesn’t really matter much of a damn what the BBC says or doesn’t say about it.\nThe Kurds could legitimately claim self-determination; however, realpolitik means something different. Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran would need to be broken up in order for a Kurdish state to emerge. This is not going to happen: indeed Turkey would go to war to stop it. Pears Morgaine states that Taiwan should have the right to self-determination as per the UN. But that could never happen either since China and Russia have veto power at the UNSC. These are not simple matters and all interests have to be taken into account. The potential for war is ever present.\nAnd Palestinian realpolitik? There’s about three times as many Kurdish people, but no state. Though not all want a separate one of course.\nDo the Kurds have a reasonable claim to any part of Syria? They aren’t a majority anywhere and most moved into Syria after the establishment of the Syrian state, implicitly recognising the legitimacy of Syrian rule.\nI saw a Quora answer saying that, plus that centuries ago they worked with the Ottomans so shouldn’t now claim independent land from Turkey. And are ethnically Iranian so can’t claim independence there, like numerous other groups can’t. So maybe start from Iraqi land, but also said that they displaced people there.\nYet is it right to say they are the main ethnic group now longest associated with the Zagros mountain range etc? But can also move back and forth between town and village. Not too enamoured of living by clocks and lines traditionally.\nFWIW Kurds are a majority in Rojava, but (as is great to report) the administration there is non-ethnic.\nThis area has been called Syrian Kurdistan by some. Some may have difficulty in appreciating that those with historically oppressed nationality can actually have the good sense to be anti-nationalist, as many Kurdish people are.\nJust come into my mail – box from Sanctions Office.

In Kosovo, the West promoted self-determination as a normative right of secession that had to be prioritised above territorial integrity. In South Ossetia and Crimea, the West insisted that the sanctity of territorial integrity, as stipulated in the UN Charter, must be prioritised over self-determination”. https://alethonews.com/2024/12/24/the-case-for-dismantling-the-rules-based-international-order/\nSeems that a fair few 2022 Lab and Con voters switched to Reform in Glenrothes Central and Thornton.\nThe SNP will be pleased.\nSoon Reform may achieve second place in polling for the next Scottish general election, behind the SNP – and it’s not hard to imagine how they might try to win over a section of former SNP voters too.\n“When cats purr and wash, rain’s on the way.” As goes folk wisdom…\nLikewise, when comments on this blog aren’t awarded any follow-up within 24 hours, a fresh new post is about to rise and shine, like the sun in Spring.\nMeanwhile, the situation in Gaza is worsening, if that’s even possible…\nYip Guiffre – was as she put in her own words, quieted, as was Epstein – and maybe other loose ends will be quieted as well.\n“I am making it publicy known that in no way, shape or form am I sucidal.

  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2007_05_a_crazy_complex/content_33.html": "I have now returned from Russia to Shepherd’s Bush.\nThis post started as a response to a comment by Bridget Dunne on the post below, who was concerned there may have been a miscarriage of justice in the fertiliser bomb case. My own view is that the fertilser bomb, 7/7 and 21/7 cases deserve to be discussed in a much more penetrative and complex way than is being done at present. I have a strong feeling that few on any side will agree with this posting, which is probably why I need to make it.\nBridget has a good point in that certainly the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four should make us very wary. I can now reveal that I went to the Old Bailey at the request of the defence to discuss giving expert evidence in the fertiliser bomb plot case.\nIn closed session, a representative of the security services had given evidence that, in no circumstances would we accept intelligence from the Pakistanti secret services if we thought it was obtained by torture. He was simply lying, which may be a point of appeal. In the event the defence did not call me.\nMy own view is that there was indeed a bomb plot here, but whether all five defendants were involved is another matter. I fear some might have been unfairly dragged into the net. There are also questions to be asked about apparent agent provocateur activity by the Pakistani ISI, a deeply complex organisation which contains its own jihadists, and its own anti-jihadists, either of which factions might have felt their interests served if an actual bomb had gone off in London.\nBut we should be wary of the attitude that there is no such thing as Islamic terrorism and that those convicted are always innocent. I think at least some of these were guilty, and MI5 and the police do indeed deserve a measure of congratulation.\nI also accept that there is a great deal of truth in MI5’s defence on 7/7, that you simply can’t follow up on every lead. Bluntly, I would not want to live in the kind of Police State that could, and the logic of many of those posting on 7/7 failure would tend to lead us towards the kind of massive surveillance and intrusion of Karimov’s Uzbekistan. I have seen that, and believe me, we do not want more of it here.\nThe truth is also that it would require levels of pressure on the Muslim population that would lead to a still greater and justified feeling of oppression, and engender more terrorism in reaction. Let’s not head for vicious spiral country. On balance, MI5 and the police do a good job despite constant political spin, pressure and interference in their work. Hindsight is a wonderful thing; identifying cause is so much simpler once you actually have an effect.\nBut where the security services and police did go wrong was after 7/7, in repeated lies to the public, the media and parliament over how much they did know. It turns out not to have been true that these bombers “Came out of nowhere” and “Had not crossed the radar screen before”. This overly defensive reaction was perhaps understandable as a first instinct before all information could be collated from the files, but maintained far too long. Why? And how involved were the spin doctors?\nThere is material here which indeed needs public inquiry. But let it not be based on the notion that security must never “fail”. That is a false direction. Much more important is how to reduce the despair that drives young British people to contemplate desperate acts of violence. As has frequently been proven, the most important step that can be taken is to stop our blind support for the appalling Bush policy of aggression in the Middle East. In the bigger picture, the dead, maimed and bereaved of 7/7 should count as part of the Blair legacy.\nThe point you make that \"we should be wary of the attitude that there is no\nsuch thing as Islamic terrorism and that those convicted are always innocent\" is an important one: I would say that anyone who doesn't accept that is not taking the discussion seriously. The fact that the fear of Islamic terrorism can be used for political purposes by the Government depends on that fear being a plausible one. This applies even if one suspects or believes that false flag incidents have taken place.\nI also agree with your comments about hindsight: however, in this case the\n\"incompetence defence\" does not look very plausible. There has been a cover up: the reason for the cover up could be to cover up incompetence, but it could be more sinister. The question of who benefitted from the events of 7th July 2005, while not decisive, is certainly pertinant.\nThere are fine lines between infiltration, observation, agent-provocateur activity and actual direction of terrorist activity by the intelligence services.\nIn the case of 7th July 2005, the means, motive and opportunity for a \"let it happen\" scenario are all present: most people dismiss the question out of hand because they cannot believe that our rulers and those who are paid to protect us could be so wicked. I'm afraid they could be wrong about that.\n\"There are fine lines between infiltration, observation, agent-provocateur activity and actual direction of terrorist activity by the intelligence services.\"\nThat was certainly true in the Pat Finucane case, which is why the Inquiries Act 2005 was brought in to give ministers control over the Finucane Inquiry.\nPresumably, any 'public' inquiry into 7/7 will be held under the same legislation.\nShouldn't we also be wary of the attitude that anyone who dares to raise the possibility that there may have been a miscarriage of justice believes that \"there is no such thing as Islamic terrorism and that those convicted are always innocent\"?\nI agree completely that we should not go down the road of increased surveillance, particularly of the Muslim population, for the reasons you give.\nTom Griffin is right that any 'public' inquiry under the Inquiries Act of 2005 is futile.\ncmain,\nIndeed, we should be wary of that road too.\nI agree that \"Islamic terrorism\" is a fact, to argue anything else would be absurd, but is it \"real\" and is it a \"threat\" in any truly meaningful way?\nNow the loss of innocent civilian lives in a terrorist bombing is a terrible, wasteful, event; and all sensible people should condemn such, almost meaningless atrocities. Good, that's got that out of the way. In no way do I support terrorism as a tactic. On the face of it, it's also counter-productive.\nDid IRA terrorism work? Thirty years of bombs, shootings and killing. Or did people just, finally, get tired of the violence?\nTerrorism is a form of \"warfare\" almost exclusively used by the weaker part against the stronger. Palestinian \"terrorism\" could be \"cured\" overnight, if we levelled the playing field by supplying them with artilery, helicopters, fighter jets, and tanks!\nBut how real is the perceived threat of \"Islamic terrorism\" really? In my opinion there is no real terrorist threat to our way of life at all. The whole thing is a sham. Given how many Muslim's we've blown up with our bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan and Palistine, it's surprising we don't get attacked more often in pure, bloody, revenge. All this killing can't just be a one way street can it?\nFor most of my teenage years, Britain's major cities were under \"theat\" from the IRA, but no one ever believed the IRA posed an existential threat to \"our way of life\".\nThen there was the Blitz. Bombs going off all over the place. Did this terror bombing of Britain's cities, night after night, cow our spirit or actually make us stronger and more determined to resist Hitler's dark forces?\nCompared to these previous threats, the plots by a handful of young Muslims seem almost pathetic. A few homemade bombs going off every couple of years in London, whilst terrible events in themselves, are not going to bring down the state. These attacks are more \"irritating\" than \"threatening\" when looked at coldly, calmly and without undue emotion. And surely this is the sensible attitude to adopt? We need to keep our heads and above all we musn't over-react.\nTerrorists often want us to over-react and thereby prove their thesis that the State is opressive and at heart, a brutal dictatorship when stripped of the veneer of \"democracy\".\nOne could argue that the American response to 9/11 was the biggest over-reaction to a terrorist outrage in history. One is almost tempted to see Bin Ladin as a masterful and brilliant strategist!\nUnfortunately, the right-wing cultists around Bush, were just waiting for some excuse or pretext like 9/11 to begin their war to secure the American century and world domination.\nOur politicians in Britain seem to have decided to go along with this crazed project, no matter the cost. An awful lot of people are using this \"terrorist threat\" to get rich, get publicity and get power. Almost all aspects of a fully-funtioning police state are in place, and the demise of \"democracy\" could be closer than most of us would care to admit.\nBut, the real threat to our way of life, doesn't come from these misguided and distrubed terrorists, the real threat comes from our political leaders who are milking and prostituting the situation cynically, in order to frighten us into accepting severe limitations on our liberty as the price for fighting terrorism and remaining \"safe\". At the same time these draconian measures also make the position of the ruling elite more secure, not against the terrorists, but against us, the people.\nWriteon,\nYou are of course right. It is vastly exaggerated as a threat and as a cause of death is actuarially insignificant. It in no way justifies – or requires – the attacks on our civil liberties. But it does still require best efforts by the police and security services.\nDo you have evidence that evidence was obtained under torture? Not hearsay or conjecture from a disaffected ex-Ambassador. But the sort of evidence that would stand up in court. Because if you did, then surely you would have been called to give it.\n\"In closed session, a representative of the security services had given evidence that, in no circumstances would we accept intelligence from the Pakistanti secret services if we thought it was obtained by torture. He was simply lying, which may be a point of appeal. \"\nThis is an important point that ought to be more widely known.\nThe problem, as often the case when dealing with government lies, is in going from a general knowledge (however confidently held) of the falseness of a position adopted by a state functionary, to a specifically proven counter-example. A high standard of proof is required before the mainstream media or the courts will risk confronting the state on a security-related matter, and functionaries tend to word their lies carefully, so as to make them difficult to directly refute.\nIn this case, for instance, if you have quoted the position correctly, the phrase \"if we thought it was obtained by torture\" leaves plenty of room for wiggling in the face of evidence that particular sources of information in the past had in fact been tortured.\nSpot the difference between this case from 2006 & the case under discussion.\n\"A FORMER British National Party member has been accused of possessing the largest amount of chemical explosives of its type ever found in the country.\"\nhttp://www.burnleycitizen.co.uk/display.var.95177…\nIf you noticed that they were charged under the Explosives Substances Act 1883 and not for terrorism award yourself 10 points.\nIf you were unaware of this case until now don't worry too much, it failed to make it into the national press.\nDaily Pundit,\nI have a great deal of evidence that intelligence was – and is – collected under torture. In this particular instance, I do not know if intelligence was collected under torture or not. Nor did I say I knew.\nOne of the defendants claimed information was given under torture in Pakistan. The security service representative stated that we would not accept intelligence from torture in any circuumstances. That is most certainly untrue, and I have a great deal of evidence on that.\nHi\nThere's an interesting article here about the 'Islamic' threat to Europe judging by a recent report by Europol:\nhttp://icssa.org/article_detail_parse.php?a_id=10…\nReally interesting read. Craig, you should definately try and check it out.\nAnyway, my own view is scepticism, and I think alot of other people are sceptical too, like Bridget Dunne. Personally, I am convinced that 9/11 was definately a false flag event, and I think 7/7 was too. Check this film\nhttp://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=7860484…\nwhich shows that there were preplanned 'drills' and exercises at the same time, the same day, the same stations, and using the same scenario as actually happened on 7/7.\nSo I am very sceptical and don't believe anything that the government professes.",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2017_05_18/content_14.html": "The Tory Manifesto Is Priceless\nThe most extraordinary thing about the Tory manifesto is that you can read pages and pages of it and not come upon a monetary value put on anything. Figures are extremely few and far between indeed, and where there is a cost placed on something there is normally no indication given at all of where the money is coming from.\nYou have to get to page 14 before you come across a single figure at all. Then it tells you that by 2020 they will increase the personal tax allowance to £12,500 and increase the higher rate threshold to £50,000. But it places no value at all on the next cost of this tax cut, or how it can be afforded.\nYou have to go through six more pages of waffle before you get the next figure at page 20, a National Productivity Fund of £23 billion. Again, no indication is given of the source of this funding, perhaps because it is very much an old recycled announcement.\nPerhaps the most remarkable instance of lack of clarity on funding is the promise of £8 billion extra for the NHS. Again no indication at all is given of where this money is coming from. The only indication of an extra funding source is a levy of £450 per head on overseas students for use of the NHS. That will raise only about £50 million and is just a chance for an attack on a group May particularly hates – and a bone to the racists.\nIt is impossible not to contrast the complete absence of prices on 95% of the proposals in the manifesto, and the complete lack of explanation of the source of funds on almost all the few items that are costed, with the huge media onslaught on the fiscal detail of the opposition parties’ manifestoes. A completely different standard is being applied to the Tories.\nThe BBC as usual wheeled out the Institute of Fiscal Studies, the “independent” body representing extreme neo-liberalism. The IFS has been lyrical for hours these last few days giving instant judgements on why the Labour manifesto had holes in it, repeating continually the corporate propaganda that if you increase taxes on the super-rich, they will pay less. But when invited by the BBC to comment on the finances of the Tory manifesto, the IFS merely replied that they would be presenting an analysis of all the manifestoes next Tuesday.\nThe Tory manifesto is literally priceless – it puts no price on anything. But we all know it will carry a disastrous cost for our public services and for the most vulnerable in our society,",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2022_06_no-debt/content_24.html": "Ukraine inherited none of the Soviet Union’s debt, just as Scotland will inherit none of the United Kingdom’s debt.\nRussia was the successor state to the Soviet Union, and thus got to keep the seat on the UN Security Council, the nuclear weapons and all Soviet overseas assets. On the other side of the ledger, as the successor state, it means that Russia got to keep all of the debt also. The agreement was finalised in 1993.\nIt appears certain that Westminster will insist upon being the successor state to the United Kingdom, and thus keep the seat on the UN Security Council, the nuclear weapons and the colonies. On the other side of the ledger, as the successor state, Westminster will get to keep the entire national debt too.\nThe independence of a state is a factor of its relationship to other states. It is governed by international law, not by domestic law. The position on debt is entirely clear.\nThe unionist media has raced to kickstart Project Fear by highlighting an individual who knows nothing whatsoever of international law, an Oxford University Professor of Economics, John Kay, who has conducted the utterly irrelevant exercise of dividing the UK’s national debt by 10. He states:\n“It may be reasonable to assume that Scotland would begin independent life carrying, explicitly or implicitly, a pro-rata share of UK debt, which might be in the region of £180 billion”.\nThe depth of ignorance that lies behind those words “it may be reasonable to assume” is in direct proportion to his ludicrous confidence in stating this completely false premiss. It is worth bearing in mind that Economics Professor John Kay of Oxford University is in precisely the position occupied by the academic arses who taught Johnson, Cameron and Osborne to bullshit nonsense with an air of entitlement.\nWe are in for many months of posh twits from Oxford telling us lies and expecting us to tug our forelocks at their superior demeanour.

A period of grace and amnesty, followed by a expulsion to country of servitude, or application and enforcement of new (republican) treason laws? Or something else?\nTrite answer; “sunlight is the best disinfectant”.\nIf we had a functional, independent press as opposed to one controlled by the British deep state and the oligarchs, this infiltration of foreign agents would be apparent to the public and they could make judgments accordingly.\nI tend to agree with our host that past employment in BBC Shortbread should disbar anyone from employment in whatever takes its place.\n“posh twits .. telling us lies and expecting us to tug our forelocks at their superior demeanour”.\nCultural cringe must have been a bigger factor in 2014 than is generally acknowledged. It is otherwise inexplicable why so many Scots would choose to be ruled in perpetuity by superposh, haughty Tories from southeast England. No other people on this planet would inflict that upon themselves. Just odd – and embarrassing – in the extreme.\nJay, Scots voted for independence.\nAs the “Scottish” Daily Mail headline said after the referendum it was the English that won it for us. The “us ” being the Britnats/English. Of course it was the high percentage of the rest of the UK immigrants and EU citizens ( who were told a yes vote would lose them their EU citizenship) who voted no that tipped the balance of the result. Sadly for the EU citizens they then didn’t get a vote in the EU referendum but people from Ireland and Australia for example did get a vote.\nJay it is not “inexplicable” in the least. It is a standard result of colonial occupation and the cringe is stronger the longer the occupation and 307 years is pretty long. Wales is a lot longer with something like 20% of its population identifying as English. If you doubt the occupation in Scotland then think FORT WILLIAM. Is the cringe the fault of the colonialists or the colonised?\nThere was no decision to be ruled “in perpetuity”. Hence the vote for another referendum.\nWhat we know as the ‘Scottish Cultural Cringe’ is actually a serious psychological condition known as ‘Appropriated Racial Oppression’, also referred to as ‘Internalised Racism’. In colonialism (which involves racism) this is also known as a ‘disease of the mind’ (Fanon; Memmi). The only cure is for the alienation to cease which is by the complete disappearance of colonization, i.e. liberation and self-recovery of the people.\nhttps://yoursforscotlandcom.wordpress.com/2021/08/15/determinants-of-independence-ethnicity/\nThe majority in favour of union was 383,837. We will assume that Irish and other EU citizens and Commonwealth citizens divided equally in their voting, According to the 2011 census, 459,486 people in Scotland were born in England Assuming the same proportion voted as voted in the whole population of Scotland, (84.59%) and people too young to vote somehow did vote, then 388,679 voted. If they all voted to keep Scotland in the UK, that would have barely provided the majority you claim, but it would also mean that nearly all the examples of English-born supporters of Scottish independence cited in the campaign were liars or didn’t exist.\nWee Jim\nDon’t ignore ‘extraction’, which will tend to significantly change the figures you mention. Where a person is born is not the sole factor here. We tend to develop our culture, language and hence our identity and our values from those closest to us, and primarily our parents/family. As James Kelman is reputed to have said, ‘if you want to know your identity look at who your relatives are’.\nAre you suggesting people should be required to pass a test for Scottish extraction before they are allowed to vote in referendums in Scotland?\nParental descent is a condition for national citizenship in most if not all nations.\n“Parental descent is a condition for national citizenship in most if not all nations.”…but it is not the only possible condition. Even when parental descent is an automatic qualification for citizenship – as in Germany and Israel – it often transpires that the people in question have lost their “extractative qualities”.\nBy the same token, Commonwealth and EU citizens and those with Commonwealth and EU “extraction” should not be allowed to vote and those of Scottish descent in other countries – such as most Irish Unionists and Scots-Americans should be able to vote, which might have produced an entertaining prospect.\nWee Jim, you really really like your assumptions which not surprisingly favour your argument but you provide no evidence to suggest they are true.\nI’d have thought the numbers are pretty powerful evidence – or do you maintain the 2011 census was doctored?\n@Jay, the Snat proposal to keep the pound, stay in NATO and the EU would have led to an independent state in name only, like Liarbour’s soft Brexit.\nThere would also be no border with EU – leaving Scotland in a reverse NI position.\nWhile I agree with Boris, independence is a once in a generation question that shouldn’t be raised now. It also needs to be pointed out that Independence now would be far far tougher for Scotland that it would have been before Brexit. Not just trade but freedom of movement (employment).\nAnd none of these issues have been mentioned in public discussion (for the obvious reason that they will turn the debate against independence).\nIf Scotland had won the independence vote in 2014, it would have invoked Brexit for the entire UK. That problem no longer exists which as far as I can tell, makes independence simpler this time around, not tougher.\nAs for the debt, unless Scotland is borrowing money from Westminster, then it is Westminster which has accrued the debt which makes them liable for it.\nI don’t think that’s correct; had Scotland become independent in 2014, it would have left the EU, and had to apply. Meanwhile the rump UK would have remained in the EU.\nNot that it matters now – water under the bridge etc.\nDae yer hame work afore mumpin’ yer gums.\nCitizens of the Irish Republic have open access to employment in the UK. Always have had. Brexit didn’t make one iota of difference. This arrangement would extend to Scottish citizens on a reciprocal basis.\nNorthern Ireland has four designated Customs ports of entry under the Northern Irish Protocol (Belfast port, Larne, Warrenpoint container terminal and George Best airport). That’s 1.2 POE for every one million citizens. A combined Northern Ireland / Scotland entity would merit 15 POE on a similar per capita basis.\nAllowing for Ports of Entry in the four Scottish international airports plus Grangemouth and Glasgow docks, this leaves seven points of entry to cover the Tweed / Solway (A Customs PoE at Larne would be redundant). There ain’t seven HGV suitable crossings of the Tweed / Solway.\nThe “difficulties” of a hard border between Scotland and England are a much exaggerated bogeyman intended to scare small children and wilfully ignorant Unionists.\nWhat makes you think that citizens of the Irish Republic will have open access to employment in the UK – or even open access to the UK – in future? A customs barrier is going to make it much easier to impose a barrier to people. The British government has already complained about Ireland’s “open door” policy for Ukrainians and announced that Ukrainians will not be allowed to come to the UK from Ireland.\nA likely result of attempts to enforce the Protocol is that the UK government will dump full responsibility for NI on the EU. The UK’s present situation in NI is one of taxation without representation – EU policies are to be followed but paid for by the UK.\nWee Jim, what makes you think it won’t.\nWhat makes me think what won’t work?\n“What makes you think that citizens of the Irish Republic will have open access to employment in the UK – or even open access to the UK – in future?”\nThat both governments have committed to maintain the CTA, and the associated rights and privileges, in all circumstances through a Memorandum of Understanding in 2019 and that the withdrawal agreement also makes provision for the CTA. Also, remember it applies to Irish citizens in UK and UK citizens in Ireland (as well as Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man). It’s been around since 1922 and long pre-dates the EU or it’s predessors. It was an understanding but since brexit has been more formally provisioned in legislation in both UK and Ireland.\nIt could be unilaterally changed but I doubt it will be.\nI think it will probably be changed, unless it is used to extract concessions from the RoI and the EU that haven’t been offered so far. In fact, the logic of the Protocol is that the UK will ditch responsibility – financial and political – for NI onto the RoI and the EU. An obvious breaking point is agriculture. If the UK is expected to pay for EU agricultural policies in NI when it is adopting very different policies in Great Britain these will be cracks in the system.\nUK farmers used to receive subsidies from the European Union via the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but that financial support was replaced by funding from Westminster after the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. This applies in NI also. The UK decides how it will support farming and farmers with subsidies in the UK. The protocol is about movement of goods and has nothing to do with that. Farmers can farm how they like but obviously if they wish to sell product into the EU they will have to comply with whatever standards for that product the EU has set. If they wish to sell into the rest of the UK they’ll also have to comply with UK standards.\nI think it very unlikely changes will be made to the common travel area arrangements. There is too much cultural and historical connection between UK and Ireland.\nGet them by the Tridents and their hearts and minds will follow.\nMichael, sorry to disappoint you but the matter of Scottish independence is not for Johnston to decide it is for the people of Scotland and they voted for a referendum on Scottish independence.\n” Far far tougher” – your concern is noted and appreciated but things ain’t that rosy in the UK.\nIn the strictest legal sense Russia was not the “successor state” to the former Soviet Union as defined by the Vienna Convention. Because of the hurry to get rid of the nuclear weapons on non-Russian territories a new entity the “continuer state” was invented. This makes comparison with previous succession or continuation after the collapse of other states difficult, sometimes impossible.\nThe proviso to Russia paying the debt was that it got to keep all the ex-Soviet owned assets in former member states which would include military equipment, gold and currency reserves, certain items of infrastructure, buildings etc. Ukraine still hasn’t returned these assets.\nhttps://tass.com/world/1374367\nForgot to mention that when Czechoslovakia split, its debt and assets were divided 2:1 according to population ratio.\nhttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d4dfa0d5-16cf-47c8-8918-a9f8b96b27fb\n“…buildings etc. Ukraine still hasn’t returned these assets.”\nHow do you “return” a building?\nThat strikes me as a thoroughly childish argument…..are you really saying a seat at the UN is worth £3 trillion plus a few colonies ?\nWhere do you get £3 trillion from? The National Debt is about £2.3 trillion gross, less the £880 billion owned by the BoE, so £1.4 billion net. It is not a normal debt anyway as it is the cash savings of UK citizens and thus part of the UK money supply. It is accumulated state spending that has not yet been taxed back.\n@Tim Rideout,\n£1.4 trillion, shurely?\nNot that there is a market for such things, but that sounds pretty cheap. It’s not just any old seat at the UN, it’s one with the power of veto..\n@Bayard, indeed, the UNSC veto is the ultimate get-out-of-jail card. Plus threatening people with nukes. And claiming natural resources around distant islands. And military bases and ports. And strategic positions from which to tap international cables for highly-lucrative espionage.\nAlthough, from reading Tim Lang’s Feeding Britain, for all that, the British imperial authorities seem awfully poor at actually protecting their food import supply lines (like they had to do in WW2, and nearly lost because it was such a tight battle).\nNot really, the peak of the U-boats’s success was in early 1943 but changing imports from raw materials to finished items reduced demand for shipping space by 25%. (Britain’s War Machine: Weapons, Resources and Experts in the Second World War, 2011)\nAs you’ve already stated, Craig, how is it going to be possible to have a fair indyref, when the media is more than likely biased against it, as is the Civil Service? Already I feel as though I’ve been transported back to the pre-indyref 2014 and all the lies and fearmongering that went on then. Already we even have BLiS MSP Alex Rowely calling for a third option on the ballot paper to dilute the vote.\nhttps://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.heraldscotland.com%2Fpolitics%2F20218692.scottish-independence-msp-demands-home-rule-alternative-yes-no%2F\nROS not the VOW and devomax the sequel. Are there people stupid enough to fall for this nonsense? It was supposed to be delivered back in 2015 and Labour and the other British parties vetoed it in the Smith Commission.\nEconomics is not a science. Economists are akin to religious leaders, they make stuff up and change their predictions to suit the outcomes. Total BS merchants.\n-was anybody happy to pay a tribute to the EU when we Brexited?\n-was there any legal obligation to pay anything?\nIf we want to leave the Union, there isn’t a lock on the door or a jailkeeper barring the way.\nYou lot like to get your knickers ina twist about what is right, wrong, legal, illegal or just bad manners.\nIf we take independence (hopefully because a majority of the population wants it), we do not need London’s permission.\nI barely care about the UN charter on self-determination, and I couldn’t care less what the corrupt and empire-building EU says on the matter (there is no independence inside the EU fhs)\nIf Westminster or Paris, or Brussels or Frankfurt doesn’t like the terms we leave on, then they’ll use their might to block trade or crush the currency. T’was ever thus. We just have to be prepred to ride it out.\nAt this point, we have an entire parliament in Edinburgh of cowardly morons; there is no way they could run an independent nation. We also have a rabble who lounge about getting fat in Westminster and do nothing for us.\nIf you want independence, you should set up your own government in exile and prove to the voters you are worth electing.\nThis nation has countless smart people, not many of them seem to want to be in politics -but maybe there’s the rub.\n-was there any legal obligation to pay anything?\nIn my view no, but Boris handed over the cash.\nSo who pays for Scottish pensions?\nAden, so who pays for English pensions?\nThere are no English or Scottish pensions now. There are British pensions paid out of British pension funds. In the case of civil and public servants an independent Scotland would presumably accept responsibility for paying those pensions for both current and future. retirees.\nThere is no “British pension fund”. State pensions are paid from state revenue and private pensions are paid by the private pension funds. In an independent Scotland, the new Scottish state would take over the paying of Scottish state pensions and the private pension funds would be unaffected.\nSee, this is interesting because if Scotland gained its independence, then of course, it would no longer be a part of the United Kingdom, but would it still remain a part of Great Britain or The British Isles? Physically, it would still be a part of Great Britain and If it remains British, then British pensions would be paid out of British pension funds.\n“British pensions would be paid out of British pension funds.”\nOnly British private pensions, to which the pensioners would be entitled by virtue of having paid their contributions, not because they were either British citizens or were resident in Britain.\nO/T.\nCould the Federal government (US) be working with the Australian government to, dare I say it, free Assange\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/federal-government-lobbying-behind-the-scenes-for-assange-s-freedom-20220618-p5auq3.html\nthanks for that ray of hope RoS, lets hope it is a genuine attempt that is reciprocated by voices in America, Biden is not known to be sweet on him.\nMy heart goes out to his wife and children, may the negotiations be swift and fruitful, nobody could take another psychological blow at this time.\nThe Australian government obviously doesn’t have much influence on the British government (cf Patel’s disgraceful decision) and it has even less influence on the US government.\nAs far as the US government is concerned, its “allies” (with the exception of Israel) are just countries administered by people who do what Washington tells them to do. If they don’t, they get “regime change”d. The CIA is quite good at that.\nHave Scottish MPs taken a stance on Assange? The other MPs don’t seem to have done much.\nEarly day motion signed by 6 out of 45 SNP MPs (poor show), full complement of ALBA and Plaid Cymru MPs.\nhttps://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/59685/campaign-to-oppose-extradition-of-julian-assange-to-the-usa\nI’m sorry but you are talking the proverbial.\nYou will get all the of the civil service pension debts. You will get all of the state pension debts.\nNow you are saying you won’t get any of the assets.\nNo use of the pound.\nNo support for Scottish banks. Well to be more accurate, they won’t be any, they will move south within hours.\nNo access to clearing.\nSo no assets? How are you going to fund that?\nThe security council bit is clear, you’ve left. The seat remains with the UK.\nComplete bollocks. We do not need any UK ‘assets’ just as we do not need your debts. Scotland will manage just fine.\nGold and currency reserves? Railway? Shipyards? Pension funds?\nIn case you hadn’t noticed, the railways were privatised some years ago. The private companies would continue to operate north of the border. The track and infrastructure would belong to the Scottish state to the extent it now belongs to the British state. Ditto shipyards. Ditto pension funds, there being no state pension fund.\nTrack and infrastructure belong to Network Rail which is publicly owned by the UK. Shipyards owned by Bae Systems a PLC with it’s HQ in Farnborough. UK state pension funded by NI contributions administered by central government.\nOther UK owned assets include the five nuclear power stations in Scotland of which only one is operational. Hunterston B was shut down in January and is in the process of being de-fuelled by operators EDF. The spent fuel will be sent to Sellafield for re-processing/storage after which ownership will be transferred to the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Agency which already owns the other three. Full decommissioning might take 120 years (it’s been claimed that Dounreay might be safe by 2333) with a similarly significant bill. If, as has been claimed, everything in Scotland after independence belongs to Scotland then they become Scotland’s responsibility. After all Scotland benefitted from the electricity they produced and the employment they provided. That’s before we consider the three MoD sites also awaiting clean up.\nGood luck!\n“Track and infrastructure belong to Network Rail which is publicly owned by the UK.”\nSo what? All the roads and road bridges are publicly owned by the UK state , too. Are you seriously suggesting that the rUK would rip up the track and demolish the bridges, simply for the small amount of scrap value that they would be worth? Even Johnson and Co aren’t that petty.\n“Shipyards owned by Bae Systems a PLC with it’s HQ in Farnborough.”\nAgain are you seriously suggesting that all English companies will pull out of an independent Scotland? How would they gain from that?\n“UK state pension funded by NI contributions administered by central government.”\nAh, that old myth. NI contributions are not ring fenced, so NI is just another tax on labour. In any case, as there is no pension fund, even if they were, after independence, Scottish workers would contribute to Scottish pensions and English and Welsh workers would contribute to English and Welsh pensions.\nWell, yes, no one is disputing that Scotland would inherit the liabilities of administering the infrastructure in Scotland. They don’t form any part of the national debt under discussion.\nAny UK owned assets (post office, Network Rail, Faslane, etc) will become the property of ScotGov as of Independence Day. ScotGov may agree otherwise, e.g. for a building to become the UK Embassy if it so chooses as part of the negotiations. The UK is entitled to remove moveable goods such as RAF aircraft, the subs, etc. We will introduce the Scottish Pound ‘as soon as practicable’ after Independence Day. UK foreign reserves are only US$88 billion net, so any share for Scotland would be trivial. We don’t need it because the Scottish Reserve Bank will acquire £50-60 billion of Sterling reserves simply as the net proceeds of selling the Scottish Pound into existence. The banks will not ‘all move south’ unless they wish to cease doing business in Scotland. What will be moved to rUK in a subsidiary of the relevant banking group, will be all the existing Sterling bank accounts. So RBS Plc accounts in Sterling will be moved to (probably) Natwest Plc and be legally in England. RBS (Scotland) Plc will start with a zero balance sheet that will be populated by us as we switch our Sterling into the S£. It is all quite straightforward. Just see http://www.reservebank.scot\nAden, Scotland does not leave the UK it terminates the UK.\n“You will get all the of the civil service pension debts. You will get all of the state pension debts.”\nState pensions are funded from revenue, so they are not a debt, they are a liability. They are no different to the liability to pay civil service and politicians’ salaries.\nThe problem Scotland may face if it refuses to accept any share of the UK’s debt is that the British government could decide to take away the Scottish infrastructure built but not yet paid for by UK debt.\nWhat infrastructure would that be, infrastructure generally not being mobile?\nBreak it down into small enough pieces and it’s very mobile.\nBreak it down into small enough pieces and it’s completely useless. Are you suggesting the UK will pursue a “scorched earth” policy?\nWhat’s the UK doing in NI?\nIn fact, England, as the UK’s successor state, can simply refuse to contribute to completion or maintenance of Scottish infrastructure during negotiations over independence and leave it to time and the elements to do the damage.\n“What’s the UK doing in NI?”\nMany things, but not removing the bridges, the energy and water supplies, the railway lines and the rolling stock and stripping the factories.\n“In fact, England, as the UK’s successor state, can simply refuse to..”\nThere lots of things they can do but that doesn’t mean they are likely to do them.\nexpecting us to tug our forelocks at their superior demeanour. ….\nSo says one of the elite…\nYeah, so “elite” that CM got thrown in jail for offending the Establishment, you fucking idiot.\nJust because one has fallen out with the elite, does not mean one is not one of the elite.\nHow does a non-elite enter the FCO and rise through its ranks to become an Ambassador? An acquaintance wants to know so that they can enact a change in their career trajectory.\nI’m quite sure the acquaintance has not ‘read’ anything at Oxbridge, but he’s a handy carpenter; if that helps.\nIf Scotland has to take a 10% share of the debt of the UK then Scotland should get a 10% share of the assets of the UK and that is a much better deal for Scotland than just not taking any debt. We should take Buckingham Palace or Windsor castle as part of our 10%. It would be a good country/holiday home for our President. It would help make up for Scotland helping to pay Englands national debt after the Treaty of Union 1707. Of course Scotland entered the Union with no debt.\nProblem for rUK is the liabilities are bigger than the assets. Just leave the whole shooting match with rUK. We do not need any of it.\nTim, I never said we needed the assets. Just pointing out the one sided exceptionalism of the Britnats where all they think about is offloading some of the debt THEY have accumulated whilst ripping off other nation’s resources.\nWhat about the Queen, will Scotland have 10% of her? Cost and assets, of course.\nI’m not sure you are correct in stating that there will be no debt. When the UK left the EU, it was required to take on its share of EU debt (and more surprisingly even some future debt). UK debt was used amongst other things to build roads, hospitals and other infrastructure in Scotland. Will the hospitals remain the property of the UK? Will Scotland want its share of gold reserves? Who will pay the pensions of Scottish? I don’t know the answer to any of these questions – I am surprised these issues were not fully clarified before the previous referendum – I suppose there will be some withdrawal agreement, which will be worked out in detail AFTER the referendum in a similar manner to the Brexit chaos. I presume there is an option for Scotland to just walk away, just as the UK could just have walked off from the EU without any agreement – but for various reasons that is not what happened in practice.\nTo be honest, I am in favour of England holding a referendum on leaving the UK – and really its England’s turn. Why should Scotland be the only part of UK given an opportunity to leave. Perhaps England first, then Wales, then NI before Scotland gets a second shot.\nUnfortunately Craig, your position appears to be disinformation. A good read is the case for the split of Ireland from UK in 1925: (https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article/24/4/818/5827947). See section 2.4: “As both historical and modern contemporaries have recognised, there is no unique mechanism to apportion debts in the case of state secession.”.\nIt seems there were some calculations which gave Ireland generous terms (based on the feeling that Ireland had limited capacity to pay). In the end the UK was even more generous and forgave the entire debt, for reasons pertaining to NI. (at that time UK was still an empire with significant interests in India etc.). In any case, it is clear that there will be a debt – and it is naïve to think it will be forgiven – but at this point I doubt any professor knows the amount. The UK is no longer an empire and the standard of living is not significantly lower in Scotland than the rest of the UK – to avoid massive disappointment it’d probably be best to assume a split based on gdp rather than per capita. (or work out both). The Brexiters were reprehensibly dishonest with regards to both the debt the UK would pick up, not to mention the portrayal of the promised Canada++++ trade deal.\nOf note, this historical union of two incompatible peoples can be traced back to James Stewart – so I’m inclined to think as part of any treaty the entire monarchy should be shipped back to Balmoral / Edinburgh castle where it originates.\nIn defence of Mr Murray, I cannot believe that anything he writes in this blog can fairly be called “disinformation”. That word clearly implies an intention to deceive, which I have never seen in Mr Murray.\nAt worst, he might occasionally be somewhat misinformed. (Perhaps less often than the rest of us, particularly on his “specialist subjects”).\nFair enough – I did not intend to imply deception. (in this case just suggesting something that is inconsistent with common sense – and which could have been knocked down before posting with a little research by an educated person. Obviously ‘common sense’ probably depends on where you stand, and I am always amazed by the number of people who appear to have a great deal of common sense, except on all matters relating to money). The test will come when someone goes on national tv to put forward this type of ‘windfall’ proposal. If sovereignty cannot be obtained without making ludicrous suggestions of evading debt – then it is a lost cause.\nYes, but Ireland did not take any share of UK National Debt in 1922. The only thing Ireland agreed to pay was a 1906 Liberal Government scheme which had provided loans to tenant farmers to buy out their landlords. As the farmers had to repay the loans (over something like 40 years) then the Irish government carried on collecting the repayments and passed them to London. They stopped doing that around 1936, and eventually London wrote off the balance.\nThe “debt” the UK took on from the EU wasn’t some kind of per-capita sharing of EU “national debt”, it was liabilities that the UK had accepted under treaty terms. This was for things like pensions for Eurocrats; that is, a lot of it was future liabilities, not current debt. Those obligations were not dissolved by Brexit. If the UK had just “walked away”, they would have been sued.\nI don’t think Scottish independence is comparable; Scotland has no treaty obligation to pay future UK civil service pensions. In fact it has no treaty obligations at all; only states can make treaties.\nWith respect to fixed assets like hospitals and railways, I don’t see why a newly-independent Scotland couldn’t simply nationalise them, if the rump UK decided to get awkward.\nHow to explain this in a way that is relatable.\nFour friends Bob, Ewan, Jiimmy and Sean go for a night of heavy drinking – putting everything on the tab. When it comes time to pay, the bill is 120 quid. Bob suggests they each cough up 30. Jimmy has other ideas. “Och nay, i kenno understand – i only came because you sed it would be drinking, no mention of paying and i only hed a few drams – it would make mo sense if I leave now”.\n“How to explain this in a way that is relatable.”\nExcept that it is not relatable. In real life, Scotland was not party to incurring the debt. A relatable situation would be where Bob invited Ewan, Jimmy and Sean for a session and provided the drinks, then tried to split the cost at the end of the evening.\nOf course Scotland was party to incurring the debt – as a member of the union it has representation. Gordon Brown was no less than chancellor and presided over the bail out of the Bank of Scotland. UK debt increased massively during this period. This is mostly irrelevant – divorce courts are not interested in listening to “he was controlling / she was spendy” type of arguments.\nNow I read “Blair was born in Edinburgh” .. Jesus Christ.\n“Of course Scotland was party to incurring the debt – as a member of the union it has representation.”\nBy “Scotland” I mean an independent Scotland. Sure, Scotland has its own parliament now and debts incurred by the decisions of that parliament would remain with the government of an independent Scotland. However, the Scottish Parliament is not responsible for debt incurred on its behalf by Westminster. So what if some of the MPs represent constuencies in Scotland? They are not part of the Scottish government.\nIn colonialism, native elites are always in league with the oppressor, which is why ‘colonialism is a cooperative venture’ (Memmi).\nWhere one is born is of less relevance than where one’s parents come from and in terms of their culture and identity.\nI posted a similar, if less eloquent, “no debt “ argument on another forum last year. But I did not have the benefit of Professor Kay’s £180 billion estimate. Let us take it at face value.\nGiven that there are 2.5 million Scottish households then Scottish independence effectively yields a gift of £72,000 to each of them (180,000 millions divided by 2.5 millions).\nThis, of course, depends on Rump Yookay winning status as the successor state to ponce around the world as a wee pretendy Global Power.\nAs Craig points out, its downside is that they take the successor state’s debt with them, including Prof Kay’s £180bn.\nIs this the John Kay who said in 2014 that financially, Scotland would be neither particularly better nor worse off with independence? Doesn’t sound like a raging unionist.\nMy understanding is the debt share could be zero bur will be a matter of negotiation – the white paper in 2013 discussed a population share of debt as one option. That of course depends on a satisfactory allocation of assets. Which is where you may well be right Craig, should the UK government prove incapable of negotiating a mutually acceptable deal.\nProfessors of economics may be somewhat ignorant of international law. Just as seasoned international diplomats may be prone to ignore some of the practical realities of economics and finance.\nYour substantive point about the law may possibly be correct (though I note that you are not a lawyer, either); but if you quoted Kay correctly, his sentence starting “It may be reasonable to assume …” does not express “ludicrous confidence”. Nor does he assume that the operation of international law brings about the division of debt (“explicitly or implicitly”).\nYou go on to insult Kay in crude terms, which convey nothing about Kay, but something about you personally. By the way he is Scottish, having been born in Edinburgh.\nSo it is reasonable to assume that such a lax comment by the Prof. would have not been forwarded by Nick, as it is far too ludicrous for a genuine factual publication.\nAs for the rest of your critic, it says to me that your err seems to be with Craig personally, the Prof. very likely had far more acidic and abrasive comments by his peers in the past.\nMaybe you can ask him to comment on the substantual argument and the possible wishy washy conclusions these 180 billions/or nothing wiĺl have on a SNP campaign for Independence, which is also as clear as mud.\nFinally, Independence is only as good an idea as it is seen by all it matters to, how open it is and how it works for all. It will not work with a secretive self-preserving entity as it is present now.\nDo you want to see Independence from England, Nick?\nStarting a sentence ““It may be reasonable to assume …” is classic Project Fear, in particular, the use of the word “may”. If it is reasonable to assume something as a premise for an argument, then it should be stated as so, “It is reasonable to assume..” If it is not reasonable to assume something, then it shouldn’t be assumed. Assumptions themselves are guesses about something the protaganist of an argument does not have hard facts on. To further cast doubt on their reasonableness in this manner can only be for one purpose, which is to present a falsehood with plausible deniability, which is the hallmark of Project Fear.\n“… to present a falsehood with plausible deniability”, the MO of the security services and the basis for the faux ‘science’ of economics.\n—\n[ Mod: ‘Stevie Boy’, you’re welcome to use your original name – but please stop posting under other aliases. Multiple identities are not allowed here. ]\nI disagree, in negotiation or in uncertainty ” it may be reasonable to assume” sounds reasonable to assume(not guaranteed)\nHow convinced would you be by an argument that started “It is unreasonable to assume….” and then proceeded to argue from those very assumptions?\nIt’s a remarkable state of affairs where some Scottish people are still scrambling in 2022 for any spurious reason to justify being ruled by the English; indeed by utterly contemptuous Old Etonian English Conservatives. Is it all some sick Orange Glasgow Rangers thing?\nI don’t think it is reasonable to just assume it is totally obvious that to break up the union is the only way forward. In other parts of Europe nationalism isn:t doing too well at present\nIt’s Bruce_H\nBTW.\n—\n[ Mod: You’re sending the name “Brice_H” in the Name field when you post comments.

That is only part of the story. And an over/simplified part. You perhaps have in mind events in Glasgow’s George Square the day after the independence referendum:\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/19/violence-glasgow-scotland-loyalists-attack-independence-supporters\nFirst, most pro-Union supporters including (at least, officially, the OO) abhor this sort of stuff. That is true even of West Central Scotland. The further removed from Glasgow/Lanarkshire, the greater the disgust, including among unionists.\nSecondly, there is no monolithic “Orange Glasgow Rangers thing”. Some Rangers supporters are stalwarts of the independence movement. One notable example is the pro-independence blogger, Roddy McLeod – a staunch Rangers man.\nI have a sneaking suspicion, that as during the WW2 parliament and the various parties created a unity government, until the end of hostilities. Suspending the rights of all these nations to certain aspects of freedoms and rights, which were supposed to be reintroduced at the end of hostilities.\nSuch as the rights of individuals to opt for trial by jury to stop the police or government going to excesses, fines, unfair laws etc. If found guilty by a jury, in these cases, the individual faces far fiercer penalties, so in practice few opted, for this option, but it also kept police and government excesses to a minimum.\nThis was never reintroduced, no surprise there then.\nThe firing of the pistol, for another referendum, is to all intents and purposes a red herring. Why?\nIt’s American and English establishment foreign strategy and policy that we shall be at war with\nRussia and the Russian federation in the next six months.\nMay I point out, the movement of troops to Kaliningrad, the strategic movement of weapons both conventional and nuclear to Europe, to the Russian borders.\nThe Nazi run Ukrainian military (a fact not mentioned in the western press), lost the war, more than a month ago, and the attrition of 1000 plus Ukrainians killed per day, every day, by the Russians, also hidden from the western media and press. This has been the plan for a long time!\nMay I point out, conscription of our sons and daughters went though its second reading in the English Parliament ten years ago. Then it was then sisted by the proposers, to go through its final reading as and when required, before becoming law. Conscription can become law in these nations within days.\nNo, there will be no referendum, not for years to come, unless we look at past history of how our young in previous generations, and how they were fodder for English wars and act now!\nA simple way and very enlightened way to prove to yourself the horrors that await our young, just look at the war memorial in Nottingham, two names WW1-2. The go to any village in Scotland and see name after name. Or better still find out about st Vallery……. still subject today, to a “D” notice. Where our young generations and Scots regiments of the Scots nation were left to stand to last man and last bullet, slaughtered and fodder, ordered by Churchill. This affected every household in Scotland, and we aren’t even allowed to read these facts.\nNow, do you understand what’s in front, of us all, our future, the future of our sons and daughters! Today, is the day. Do you trust an American and American passport holder, called Pfeffel, his real name, not Boris Johnstone or that he has your nations interests at heart? A proven liar, proroguing parliament, based on lies, starving English people with his IMF austerity policies. Removing any and all MPs that don’t follow the American facist policies….. just a few of his dictatorial inclinations.\nI won’t mention the American nuclear missile sites on the west coast of Scotland other than the fact, if America fires one nuclear missile from Scotland to Russia or Russian troops? Where do you think, Russia will fire back, apart from the south of England. And Russian nuclear and convential missiles can travel at Mach 30 plus.\nWe can change our future if we grab our future with both hands.\nGetting stroppy about who pays the divorce bill, and if a tip should be proffered, is putting a knackered horse behind a battered old cart.\nFirst a referendum MUST be held. The reason being is to establish if the majority of Scots actually want independence. It would be out of order for a minority to force a majority to accept what they didn’t want.\nDismissing the ballot box because you declare those who didn’t vote the way you wanted as ignorant, stupid, bigoted or misguided, is not the way things are done these days. The ballot box ain’t perfect, but the only alternative to the ballot box is the bullet box. I know what I prefer…_\nDigger, are you advocating a Scottish vote for those born in Scotland and residing there? a similar referendum to that of the EU excluding all that are born in the EU, but who are residing in the UK?\nIt would have to be a vote for Scottish voters in the first instance. That itself is problematic inasmuch as non Scottish voters in Scotland would be allowed to participate, I don’t have a problem with that, but some will.\nAs independence could break the Union it would be a legitimate and understandable demand for a referendum for those in the rest of the UK, I imagine that would be unacceptable to scotnats.\nSuch a referendum could be disallowed; again, I would have no problem with that. But let’s not run away with the repercussions of ignoring UK unionists, there are strong feelings both ways, alongside those like myself who would go with the decision of the Scottish electorate.\nThere is a lot of dilettante nonsense on this blog in favour of scotindependence; if it wasn’t led by somebody with a reputation for other notable activities it would be a fringe of a fringe on the edge of lunacy. But free speech is as we find it, not as we like it…\nYes it is unfortunate that free speech is permitted beyond the reactionary ravings of gammon. Perhaps that’ll be the next thing to be remedied by our government.\n“But let’s not run away with the repercussions of ignoring UK unionists, “\nWhat about those in the UK outside Scotland who are in favour of Scottish independence? Mind you, I doubt they will be given a say, because Project Fear would backfire spectacularly. Every argument as to why Scotland currently depends on the UK for funding, which is one against Scottish independence for Scots, is one for Scottish independence for the English and Welsh.\n@Bayard,\n“What about those in the UK outside Scotland who are in favour of Scottish independence”\nWhereas I reach for my pistol when the half wits sing the praises of the EU, nobody even raises the possibility of a federal union betwixt the constituent countries of the UK, based on intergovernmental cooperation, as opposed to the tyranny of the supranational EU.\nI’m a freeborn englishman, who longs for my own national history and culture to be acknowledged and protected. I’d happily do that in a federal British Union between all constituent countries of the British Isles…_\nDUK, you mean a federation like Scotland enjoyed for a hundred years before the shysters talked them out of it?\n…..”why Scotland currently depends on the UK for funding” it’s very simple and unfair. It’s Central bank of ENGLAND !!! With it’s own central bank things might be different for better or worse\nPerhaps I should have said “how” instead of “why”.\nIt’s funny how million Brit’s abroad living more than 15 years outside of UK could not vote but EU citizens living more than 15 years in UK could not either. If Brit’s abroad lost connection to UK after 15 years so I might got connection to UK after living more than 15 years.And you Brexiters have audacity to call it fair and square.\nThe scots nation won independence in 1979. The majority voted for it! It took twenty seven years for the United Nations to organise the report for the security council! The verdict, from the United Nations, either give Scotland its electoral result, or England and its reprentatives would be thrown out of the United Nations…….. and Europe!\nHence the modicum of independence we now have, Thank you Mr Sillars, and Margo McDonald to mention but a few!\nI am passionate about Debt, Money creation, role of Central banks and exciting about Scottish Independence for no rational reason!\nMoney, debt , deficit, money creation, international/Eu/ financial rules are important to Scottish independens. So called Britnats will concentrate on those issues and there are to options. Have reasonable answers or going Brexit way and talking BS.\n—\nYou’re welcome to follow the discussion on Scottish debt, Scottish Central Bank,Scottish money creation & Int. rules in the Craig Murray discussion forum.\nOf all the possible role models for independence Scotland could follow, Ukraine is surely not the poster boy.\nDebt free, with abundance of resources and great geographical advantages to make a go of a country, it quickly became one of the most corrupt in the world, lowest standard of living in Europe, vastly unequal, looted both domestically and internationally by politically connected gangsters, coup ridden, hideously racist, mired in civil war, a pawn of globalist proxy battles, dirty biochemical laboratories, political assassinations, media crackdowns, book burnings, until its final complete destruction happening in front of our eyes.\nAnd all the evidence shows that Scotland’s current batch of politicians, and the strength and independence of our institutions are not any better than what Ukraine inherited.\nSurely there has to be a better model of separation to aim for.\nIt might have been better for Ukraine if it had taken it’s share of the Soviet debt, and attempted good relations with it’s Eastern neighbour, rather than inviting Nato to point missiles at it.\nI agree Geoffrey –\nInternational efforts should focus on promoting a negotiated settlement in Ukraine, not using the war as an occasion to isolate Russia, much less weaken it. Calls for mediation ensures that U.S. efforts to bankrupt Russia and demote her to pariah status will fall despite US insistence and exigence to an increasingly chaotic and dangerous world that Russia ‘invaded’ Ukraine.\nMost states want to protect some important benefits they derive from their relationship with Moscow. They also believe that publicly condemning Russia will do nothing to end the war in Ukraine.\nKnowing very little about this, I presume an independent Scotland will be 100% financing it’s own future healthcare, education and social housing etc? I thought that part of the reason the last referendum resulted in a no was because they couldn’t afford it. What’s changed? How many times can you have a referendum? As a Brexit remainer we were told that we had to accept the result.\nThe British government keeps 100% of the national debt, and 90% of the paperclips in Holyrood, and 90% of the M8. etc. All not very grown-up.\nUkraine is not a good comparator: They couldn’t afford to pay the police or turn the streetlights on. The army fed itself by selling weapons. You can imagine how the police fed itself.\nUncle Sam now bankrolls Ukraine, it underwrites its debt pays the police, army, civil servants etc,\nIn 2021 before the Russians invaded Ukraine, Ukraine’s credit ratings were B, stable or positive.\nTheir debt to GDP was 48.9%, compared to the UK’s 102.8%.\nMaybe the successor State would keep all the national debt and all of Mr Murray’s civil service pension. And negociations could be carried out by six-year-olds in a playground.\nThe UK Government clearly set their absolute priority for the rUK or whatever it wants to call itself (as Michael Forsyth Tory ex-Secretry of State for Scotland said in the House of Lords as he made it very plain that if Scotland left the UK, the UK would cease to exist) post-YES negotiations, and that was that they needed to be the Continuing UK – the cUK. So they need the UK NOT to cease to exist. This was set out in their first paper with their effevtively advocates Crawford & Boyle remitted to do this very thing – set out the case for the rUK to be the cUK, and then work from there to show that the cUK would keep the seat on the Security Council, keep the NATO, World Bank, IMF memberships – and at the time, that of the EU.\nThat would have made them very weak in post-YES negotiations, and Scotland very strong. Scotland “owns” a share of the name “UK”, by definition, similarly the Pound Sterling, and other intangible assets. But unlike the rUK, we don’t need them, as we have our own clear brand – Scotland.\nFrom that point of view, what the world would generally accept is a negotiated settlement between the rUK (whatever it wants to call itself like EWNI), and Scotland.\nThere is a Convention – the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of State Property, Archives and Debts – Vienna, 8 April 1983, which was only signed or ratified by 7 states – curiously including Ukraine. So it has no force, but can be referred to as a guide.\nIf the rUK wants to be the cUK, then that leaves Scotland to “secede” from the UK, and that secession means that the cUK does indeed own all the debt, and that Scotland can take a share – if we want. It also means the cUK would be responsible for making sure the “new state” – Scotland – got off to an economically viable start in life. As far as property is concerned, the cUK would have all movable property, and very clearly, fixed property remains where it is. There shall be no ripping up of motorways, buildings, even fences and walls, nor of docks, keys, harbours, hangars, control towers, or, presumably, even masts, though sensitive electronics could be removed.\nKay is indeed talking through his hat, I presume it’s multi-coloured with a long peak and bells on it.\nYou can get a “certified copy” from this page:\nhttps://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=III-12&chapter=3&clang=_en",

He has done full justice to the life of a remarkable British hero, without ignoring his faults’ — Peter Oborne, Daily Mail\n‘An important re-evaluation of this most intriguing figure’ — William Dalrymple\n‘This is a fascinating book … his research has been prodigious, both in libraries and on foot. He knows a huge amount about Burnes’s life and work’ —Allan Massie, The Scotsman\n‘If you are a fan of the Flashman series of books, you will be gripped by the story of this British spy’ —Hannah Ferret, The Sun\nThis blog has been going for over ten years now and has never asked for money or taken advertising. In that time I have continually campaigned on a whole variety of issues, though chiefly human rights, Scottish independence, against war, and on the need for a profoundly more equal society. I have travelled the length and breadth of the UK and around the world to speak at literally hundreds of public meetings, and have appeared in numerous videos and documentaries. My primary purpose has always been as much to promote debate and the ability to think well outside the increasingly narrow box which society prescribes, as to convert to my own precise views.\nAnd I have been paid for almost none of it. I do it entirely because I believe in it. I have never asked readers for cash to keep this blog going. I have never asked for a fee to speak in a good cause.\nBut I do ask you, now, to buy my book. I ask you to do this to get the book itself (and buy more for Christmas presents!) but also as a recompense to pay for any of my work you have enjoyed on this blog, or elsewhere, over the past decade. Sikunder Burnes is the result of eight years of unfunded hard work, and manuscript research in England, Scotland and India. It is, I believe, worth every penny it costs. I appreciate it is expensive, and I have no difficulty whatsoever if you prefer to buy the electronic version which is a great deal cheaper.\nIt is the story of the fascinating life of a man both caught up in, and attempting to shape, an astonishing period of Scottish, British, Indian, Pakistani, Kalati, Afghan, Uzbek, Iranian and Russian history. As I hope you would expect from me, it even bursts out from such a broad canvass into all kinds of unexpected intellectual directions, many of which surprised me too!\nMy preference would be for you to buy it from a bookshop if you can, because bookshops need support. Otherwise you can order it from thehive.co.uk (where it is currently cheaper) or from Amazon. Doubtless other online options are available. Unfortunately we live in a country where some people cannot afford a book, and in that case you would much oblige me by asking for it from your local library.\nTo tax your patience further, I should be most grateful if you could do a couple of other things. Firstly, once read leave a review of the book, on Amazon, Goodreads, or any other available forum. Please note that I am not asking you to puff the book – I should be very grateful if you could leave completely honest reviews.\nSecondly, it would be very helpful if you could leave comments below on your experience of buying the book. If online, was it in stock, how quickly did it come and what did you pay? If in a bookshop, did they have it on a shelf, did they appear to have heard of it, did it have to be ordered in and how long did that take etc.? Library feedback is also most welcome. We will keep this page permanently available for comment on the blog, renamed The Sikunder Burnes Page. Your views on the book are also very welcome here.\nFrankly, I do need the revenue from the book to keep going because at the moment finances are very tight. But it means more to me than that, in that it represents a step towards a new career direction where a shunned whistleblower might be permitted to work.\nPlease do buy, and enjoy, Sikunder Burnes.\nRead Sikunder Burnes – the first 9 chapters for FREE!\nBuy Amazon Hardback\nOr Buy Kindle ebook\nOr Buy Google Play Books\nOr Buy Kobo ebook\nUPDATE We are no longer selling signed editions from this blog, as we have run out.

They were charging $37 CDN for the paperback edition.\nI eventually turned to Amazon.ca to find that they had one (1) paperback copy available, which I now expect to receive in the post tomorrow. They are charging $33.50 CDN for the paperback.\nI went to Daunt Books in Holland Park Avenue, London as soon as bookshops were allowed to open – 29/30 June 2020. Could not find your book ‘Sikunder Burnes’ on the display shelves. The shop assistant looked it up and said they did have a copy but it was now ‘mysteriously’ lost! Ordered a copy, which I collected on 3 July. I have yet to read the book, which I hope will prove to be interesting.\nLiked your article on BBC adaptation of ‘The Salisbury Poisonings’ – very thorough and enlightening.\nI bought the book this morning, and am starting to read it . I bought it as an eBook, from Rakuten-Kobo. it is au$6.00 more expensive there compared to Amazon, but I dislike Amazon’s business practices and also hoped you would receive a larger cut. This is the only book by you on the site. It is well presented and downloaded immediately, no problems. I will certainly leave reviews wherever I can. I also want to thank you for your work for human rights, especially for Julian Assange at the moment. After reading your most recent transcript of the court hearing, I was unable to sleep. Ha! In New Zealand we were brought up to worship British Justice and fair play. Proudly British. Cricket and all that, old chap. Thanks to the internet I have discovered the depth of British depravity especially during the colonial era. It was obvious, had we been encouraged to think! Right before my eyes the plight of the Maoris, and even worse of the Australian Aborigines. But no one questioned how one country could maintain a stranglehold on 1/3 of the planet without any violence… We learned the entire royal history and every single one of their magnificent wars as they spread sweetness and light across an unenlightened and savage world.\nI would love to sponsor you, but am only on a pension so haven’t much spare cash. I will buy your next book when it comes available, Sincere best wishes,\nRigby Taylor.\nI\nJust bought the hardback from berlin.co.uk as a small thank you for all your hard work this month reporting the Assange trial. Looks interesting. Delivery is free which is good but doesn’t say when it will arrive.\nI would like to say how much I enjoyed Sikunder Burnes. Being an Ayrshire man it was very interesting to read about the connection with Burns the Poet. However the exploits of Burnes in Afghanistan and how he was misrepresented was not only interesting but most importantly have been addressed. Burnes was clearly a genius who was let down badly by his superiors. Craig Murray is very readable easily in the same league as William Dalrymple. I was so impressed with this book I sent a copy to a young soldier friend by the name of Burns stationed in Kabul.\nBought on Amazon easily paperback for £13.79 plus postage after reading the sample pages it does`nt look as if there are many in stock.\nI will certainly order your book from my local library in Ynys Môn, Cymru. The service there is excellent.\nPob dymuniad da! Pensioner.\nI bought an Amazon kindle version of the book. I am about half way through it and find it difficult to put down. The level of detail is immense and yet it is very readable. I learned of Burnes for the first time about 40 years ago via the first in the Flashman series. Your book is completing my education about this great Scotsman. Today we could do with more like him and the other Scotsmen and women who went forth from Scotland and built its international fame.\nWill order from my local Waterstones (Twickenham) tomorrow. Will let you know if this proves difficult, although I can’t see why it should be the case.\nI’ve managed to get a copy of Sikunder Burnes. It was quite a journey. Waterstones said they did have it and couldnt order it from the Publisher. You should speak to them regarding Printing copies. Eventually managed to get a H/b copy from Amazon. It was their last copy apparently…\nHi, Craig.\nI’ve just come across your blog for the first time but much admired your principled stand all those years ago and have occasionally wished to be in touch.\nIt’s the middle of the night and I need to sleep so no time for a long or deep trawl through possible shared interests – you can find me on twitter @JeffreyNewman.\nJust now to say ‘hi’ and thanks and I’ll try to look at Burnes\nDid Tim Horlick work at Somerset Capital – which had two prominent tories running it?\nRees Mogg etc\nCraig Murray was right to draw attention to the (short but packed) life of Alexander ‘Sikunder’ Burnes. It is an exhaustive account in which the author draws upon his own experience of diplomatic service to add nuance to the description of his life. It must have taken a huge effort to track down all those sources of information. Craig makes you interested in the man’s life. And what a life (which seems to mark the beginning of the Great Game)! For those interested in how the Great Game played out over the 19th & 20th century, it is book ended by Patrick French’s biography of Younghusband.

I have not heard any elected representative of the SNP argue the case for Independence for… well since Autumn 2014.\nIt is not surprising the increase in the polls of support for Independence has stalled, as nobody is putting the argument. The trouble with leaving the matter aside until support becomes overwhelming, is that if you leave the matter aside support never will become overwhelming.\nI am therefore considering standing as an Independent in the Scottish parliamentary elections, purely to put the full-on case for Independence. There are plenty of other people who can argue about the minutiae of the glorified council at the bottom of Holyrood Road. The SNP has explicitly stated it wants the votes of unionists as well as nationalists in this election. I don’t.\nI want to give people who want to express their desire immediately to be shot of the corrupt and warmongering British state, a chance to say so unequivocally at the ballot box once again.\nThis is a question of principle. It is not undertaken with any expectation of being elected. I would stand in North East Scotland on the regional list ballot.

This is sometimes worrying. I was, rather strangely, on a Christian radio show with Zac Goldsmith once, and we chatted afterwards, and he seemed a really pleasant and genuine person. I was surprised by the stuff he allowed in his name during the London mayoral election.\nSimilarly I went out drinking with David Aaronovitch after a debate in Dublin and we got on famously. I seldom agree with him, and therefore attack him often on my blog, but I have to admit I like him in person.\nBut I am very happy to say, that the only time I ever met Toby Young, when I lived in Acton, I had to be physically restrained from a desire to attack him with a wine bottle. Even I have my limits.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I have never hit anyone, ever. This article is not advocating violence against Mr Young, merely giving an indication of the degree of my revulsion.\nCraig, you must have gone to an uncommonly – almost inhumanly – civilised school.\nYou’ve never hit anyone, and you were born in Dundee? Wow. I was born and raised in Longsight/Manchester and had a fight every other day.\nSo ‘How to Lose Friends and Alienate People’ was autobiographical then?\nHe bottled his chance to run for parliament against Slaughter.\nMost people in the Western world avoid the problem by rarely talking politics with relatives, friends, and even acquaintances.\nTrump and Hillary are so toxic that even they are discussed now. Simply amazing the guff they can gush out.\nYoung sound like a little shit, going by his heartless article, in the Daily Mail, a rag that should be read (if need be) with one’s tongue, pressed firmly into one’s cheek.\nAnyway for those of you who want to know about, the real face of the DWP and the effects sanctioning of benefits has on people, here’s a good article from someone who worked at the JobCentre.\nShe explains how the DWP conditioned her, and many other fellow workers, on a daily basis, in an attempt to desensitise the staff, when sanctioning individuals, for minor or petty misgivings.\nhttp://www.thenational.scot/comment/cat-boyd-i-daniel-blake-lays-bare-process-of-dehumanisation-practised-at-dwp.23946\nI share your surprise. The Memsahib is addicted to ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ (a popular television programme, m’lud) and I sometimes am subjected to a minute or two of it before I beggar off to the summer house for a bit of music and the occasional sharpener. Recently, I chanced to see Ed Balls esq. throwing some doxie hither and yon and may have growled something less than complimentary about him; the Memsahib bridled and barked, “we all know you don’t like him”. I thought about this for a bit and said, “Don’t know the fellow so I couldn’t say whether I like him or not, but he helped bring one of the most prosperous countries in the world to is knees economically so it would be fair to say that I don’t like what he did”. It could well be that in private I’d find him to be charming company and that the sock filled with a column of 2p coins would be entirely superfluous …\nWith respect to Toby Young’s article about dwp claimants, here’s one article on a young man who starved to death after his benefits were cut:-\nhttp://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/11112129.Government_admits_Mark_Wood_s_benefits_cut_before_he_starved_to_death__was_wrong_/\nMark Wood was a constituent of David Cameron.\nHere’s another article on malnutrition in Britain in this week’s Sunday Mirror:-\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/shocking-rise-brits-being-admitted-9106672\nAnd soon behind such poverty will come poverty afflictions like rickets, TB, lice, bed bugs, ringworm etc. The well-off think they’re immune to the contagious ones but don’t realize that even though the different classes don’t mix socially, same as before, they interact more today in banks, post offices, supermarkets, home deliveries etc. And as always the law courts where one lot sits in judgment on the other.\nThere are more ways to spread diseases now and whereas the Victorians didn’t have much quality of care we’re losing what we had, so when things like TB or lice-borne typhus spread amongst the better-off they’ll realize why it was important to contain them last time.\n“Daniel is a model citizen. At no point do we see him drinking, smoking, gambling, or even watching television. No, he is a welfare claimant as imagined by a member of the upper-middle class metropolitan elite.\nHe listens to Radio 4, likes classical music and makes wooden toys for children — the kind of over-priced ‘artisanal’ tat sold in ‘alternative’ toyshops in Islington, where Loach lives.”\n_____\nYoung is annoying but I thought this was quite good. If you think Young is punchable then you should get a feel for some of what the rest of us think of the comfortably off, middle class, sneering faux lefty type such as yourself.\nSuch as “All concern about immigration is racist”.\nSome people can be instantly likeable, brighten any company they’re in, and you instinctively know you’re going to be friends with them. This often means you are potentially useful to them. This is still a weakness on their part. Once you have recognised it, you are in a good position to thwart their little plans. Diplomacy has its uses.\nI am deeply suspicious of charming people, and I am inclined to prefer Anon, on current form, to Tony Blair for that reason.\nMind games? Moi?\nYour comment is pure, reactionary bile. It does you no credit at all. It simply castes you as a bilious reactionary, and importantly, in making such comments, reveals the absence of self-awareness.\nHow about the (very) comfortably off, middle class, sneering, entirely genuine righty type such as Toby Young, Anon? I mean, read the article. And this one, for a dissection.\nhttp://zelo-street.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/toby-young-ken-loach-smear-busted.html\nYoung’s piece is manifestly more than film-review. He’s kicking people who are, in some numbers, contrary to his assertion and very firmly, down. And can’t kick him back. He’s a POS.\nAt least we always have the pleasure of his tear stained Spectator article about no one turning up for his Stag. 🙂\nAye, because all benefit claimants are lazy, feckless, junkies. Moron.\nIt’s his faux earnestness that always tickles me, it’s so obviously for effect. You can almost see him trying!\nI know Ken Loach is a Leftist, but who else would he be referring to?\nRef the aforementioned.\n1. Agree. A decent human who stands up for his beliefs, viz his resignation today.\n2, How could you do that?\n3, This is for him. We had a double dose of him on Sunday. Marr in the morning and reviewing the papers on Sky News in the evening. On both occasions, he revealed his heartlessness.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aE-nMS9Mnk\nSurely you can express your contempt for him in more intelligent ways? Expressing a desire to hit someone – anyone – with a bottle is beyond the pale in my book.\nI can only suppose you have never read anything by Aaronovitch.\nRight, Tom, especially his emails.\nI remember well his trashing the anti-war protests in Stockholm when I was living nearby, and participated in them.\nAaronovitch made out that there were only a few misguided communists attending them, as I recall.\nWould have thrown a bottle at him if there was any hope of hitting him in London.\nI cannot comprehend this attitude of hating a person’s views, but liking them personally. You cannot separate a person from their beliefs. If a person has horrible, hateful beliefs then they cannot possibly be a likable individual.\nGoldsmith, like every Tory, supports “welfare reform”, meaning he supports one of the cruelest, most vicious policies in the history of British politics – a policy that has brought relentless suffering into the lives of our most vulnerable citizens. Put simply, he is a monster. So spare me the “genuine and pleasant” crap.\nThat’s the political methodology. It’s called being professional, but it just means ‘keeping business flowing without too many hiccoughs’ but much more poetic and reassuring. I mean it’s just rude to collar a Club Member and ask him to buy some raffles for your son’s soccer team.\nSo Zac Goldsmith struck Craig as “a really pleasant and genuine person”. While such people do exist – I am assured – those characteristics are also typical of psychopaths. And having heard that Craig got on well with David Aaronovitch, I shall have to take extra care never to meet Craig in person, lest I be tempted to hit him with a bottle. I simply refuse to believe that anyone who expresses the beliefs that Aaronovitch does can possibly be a decent person. For a start, I am fairly sure he justifies the existence of the state of Israel and its resolutely attempted genocide against the Palestinians. Although I try to avoid reading The Times, whenever I have seen an article by Aaronovitch I have felt nauseated. As far as I know, he has never held a right opinion.\nI believe this simply reflects the fact that different people can have genuinely differing convictions on how to better the lot of humankind. I listened not so long ago to a long radio interview with a Conservative MP. I think it was Gavin Barwell, but would not swear to it. I was frankly astonished by how likeable I found him.\nHe came across as having a genuine and passionate conviction that proper use of regulated markets was the best way to maintain and increase the standard of living of everyone in the country. I was struck by his compassion and concern for and knowledge of the plight of the disadvantaged.\nI came away from that interview thinking I had been listening to a profoundly misguided, but intelligent, thoughtful and compassionate human being, whose major political difference with me was an erroneous belief that “the market” was helpful to people. Perhaps I was fooled, but I got the feeling that it would have been a pleasure to work with him on non-economic matters.\nI must say that he seemed to me to be unusual among Conservatives, though. But it showed me how people like John McDonnell, for example, can share cross-party platforms with “class enemies” with no apparent cognitive dissonance.\nCareful, it sounds like you may be ready to leave your safe spaces 🙂\nConcerning ‘conservative compassion’, one politician said something to the effect of: “We hate poor people so much, we want to make them rich”.\nThat aside, globalisation (the market) HAS lifted many people out of poverty, but elsewhere in the world, which doesn’t do much for votes here.\n(Astonished by the vitriol of some people here, for whom ‘tolerance’ is apparently just a word. It’s not so much “how can people with such policies be likeable” as “how dare you even get near enough to someone with such policies to even know if they’re likeable”).\nSir Keith Joseph MP seemed perennially astonished by the fact that he was so hated.\nShrug. If you enact policies that people of intelligence and normal emotional range perceive as having put them out of work and made their lives pointless and impoverished and despairing, then it is not surprising that you are personally hated. Because you are personally responsible for what you have done, no matter how much you may have acted from a conviction that you have been doing the right thing for the long run.\nIt’s all very well for me to say – as I would in fact say – that hating people hurts the person who hates more than the person who is hated, and therefore it is not a wise way to proceed. I’m not living on sixty quid a week Jobseeker’s Allowance or working in Sports Direct for the minimum wage or below.\nhere, it seems to me is a perfectly reasonable assertion:\n“……….that proper use of regulated markets was the best way to maintain and increase the standard of living of everyone in the country.”\nThe problem is the ‘regulation’ and how that is defined. Brown went for the ‘barely regulated’ credit market and high Tory Matt Ridley,(one of our landed gentry) relentlessly, and with impunity, drove Northern Rock onto the northern rocks by bubble business thinking. It wasn’t smart-it was just ruthless loophole exploitation.\nBy and large, Tories believe in an unregulated or barely regulated form of market economics.\nI envy you. I think I judge people too harshly on their politics. I try not to. I’m a philosophical relativist. But when it comes to people advocating policies that I think are harmful to others, I’m sorry to say that I can’t see past that. Wish I could; it’s cost me many friendships.\nBasic rule of thumb: Always be doubtful about anyone called ‘Toby’ – unless its a dog. A favoured name for boy-children amongst the English-raj class. And you know how they rear their children: intense sociopathic schooling begun seriously by age seven…\nGod, you’ve got a lot of Puritans commenting on your blog, Craig. I can see their ancestors in the C17th happily burning Catholics for their wicked and heretical beliefs. “It matters not what they are like as men, they must recant or burn, because their beliefs are wrong”.\nI find Goldsmith’s concern about the environment to be rather difficult to reconcile with his vote for Trident replacement.\nPresumably, the warheads are made using ethically-sourced and environmentally friendly plutonium!\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/19/trident-how-your-mp-voted\nCraig I’m wondering if your limits being reached would also apply to the jobsworths that infest the civil service. The kind of people that have now issued new ‘guidance’ to DWP assessors to, whenever possible, sanction Social Security claimants that are at risk of self-harm and even suicide: https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/9426/outrage-campaigners-benefit-denials-suicide-risk-claimants\nI confirm one thing Young says is accurate as far as I can discover, as I have checked it. “A single mother with two children typically gets more than £200 a week in state hand-outs”. I just put that information through a benefits calculator with the following weekly results: £117.50 child tax credits; £73.10 income support; £34.40 child benefit; total £225.00 weekly. It is no good denying facts. (I object to the word “hand-outs”, by the way.)\nIf anyone can refute this, I’d be glad to hear from them, but however obnoxious Young is, I checked this fact and it’s straight.\nAnd a single non-mother gets?\nI guess that would be JSA, either £57.90 or £73.10 weekly according to age.\nIncidentally, that pompous ass Young does not mention – and I had to read reviews of the film again to pick it up, as I haven’t seen it – that the single mother has been SANCTIONED. So she isn’t getting any fucking £225 per week. What she will get – if anything – is a hardship payment. How long that takes to come through I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. Young is too ignorant, thick and arrogant to have picked up this rather important detail. No doubt he would say from his pompous middle-class lifestyle that the single mother shouldn’t have done anything to be sanctioned for. Maybe she didn’t. Maybe she’s waiting for an appeal that will be successful.\nSo if the single mother in the film has been sanctioned, is waiting for a hardship payment, is waiting for an appeal against that sanction, and has no money, how does she get the £10 to buy the cheap school shoes from Tesco’s, Mr Young?\nEh?\nWhat about housing costs and utility bills. Water for instance. My half yearly bill from Thames Water has increased massively compared to the previous one. A mother and two children will need to consume water, gas and electricity in quantity. Or perhaps they should shiver and go around unwashed in dirty clothes with holes in their shoes?\nIt’s fair to say that a goodly proportion of that £225 will go to profitised utilities, which used to provide a public service, not to mention rent to landlords kept artificially inflated by public subsidy.\nIt seems to me that Toby was disgusted that the Loach film wasn’t a musical with singing dancing chimney sweeps.\nToby Young is a “lifelong Zionist”, who thinks that wheelchair ramps in schools are an example of ghastly, politically correctness;\nhttp://www.nosacredcows.co.uk/blog/2026/my_latest_spectator_column.html\nAlthough Trump is crap (and Clinton is worse), he’s on the ball here:\n‘The Trump Effect – Trump The Establishment – This video could win Donald Trump the election’:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nge0NnTEnCI\nThere is a reason that lamposts have hooks just below the lamp. They’re to deal with the Toby Young’s of this world.\nToby Young is one of those red poppy touting, memorial sweeping, delusional Christian standard bearing protagonists that believe in ‘humanitarian intervention’ bosh and vote to send British missiles and bombs in any place that needs a proxy government, yields intrinsic natural wealth, begets geopolitical dominance demanding double containment that rules-out and obviates a liberal world order in an axis of weevils that attempts to refute the end of history and the last man in a Hegelian view dominated by the titanic forces of industrial and informational capitalism..",

Alexander Burnes was one of the most accomplished spies Britain ever produced and the main antagonist of the Great Game as Britain strove with Russia for control of Central Asia and the routes to the Raj. There are many lessons for the present day in this tale of the folly of invading Afghanistan and Anglo-Russian tensions in the Caucasus. Murray’s meticulous study has unearthed original manuscripts from Montrose to Mumbai to put together a detailed study of how British secret agents operated in India.\nThe story of Burnes’ life has a cast of extraordinary figures, including Queen Victoria, King William IV, Earl Grey, Benjamin Disraeli, Lola Montez, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx. Among the unexpected discoveries are that Alexander and his brother James invented the myths about the Knights Templars and Scottish Freemasons which are the foundation of the Da Vinci Code; and that the most famous nineteenth century scholar of Afghanistan was a double agent for Russia.\n(More/Buy)\n–––––––\nMurder in Samarkand\nCraig Murray was the United Kingdom’s Ambassador to Uzbekistan until he was removed from his post in October 2004 after exposing appalling human rights abuses by the US-funded regime of President Islam Karimov.

The attackers were members of the Hutu-extremist FNL, a faction linked to those responsible for the Rwandan genocide. Twenty others died with Charlotte, including her Burundian fiance. One of the few survivors was given a chilling message for the Burundian government: “We’re going to kill them all and there’s nothing you can do”. In “Titanic Express”, Charlotte’s brother Richard charts his painful struggle to unravel what happened that day, to understand the complex and brutal history that lay behind it. Cutting through the obfuscations of the authorities, he uncovers a story of violence, fanaticism and neglect that exposes the self-interest and double standards at the heart of our supposed commitment to human rights and the fight against terror. As the facts begin to emerge, the family’s deep personal grief is compounded by the realisation that this murder is just one among thousands, in a war fuelled as much by western cynicism and African greed as by ethnic divisions. “Titanic Express” is a political detective story, a memoir of grief and a moving portrait of an extraordinary woman who died at the very moment she had found fulfilment. In gripping detail it shows the human reality of lives torn apart by the machinations of war and diplomatic expediency, where competing versions of the truth can be as deadly as bullets and machetes.\n–––––––\nLawless World: Making and Breaking Global Rules – Philippe Sands\nInternational lawyer Philippe Sands has a unique insider’s view of the elites who govern our lives. His sensational revelations in Lawless World changed the political agenda overnight, forcing Tony Blair to publish damning material that he’d tried to hide. Now, in this updated edition with a shocking new chapter, you can get the full story of how the US and UK governments are riding roughshod over international agreements on human rights, war, torture and the environment – the very laws they put in place. Here sands looks at why global rules matter for all of us. And he powerfully makes the case for preserving them …before justice becomes history.\n–––––––\nThe New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia – Lutz Kleveman\nThe Caspian Region, lying south of Russia, west of China and north of Afghanistan, contains the world’s largest untapped oil and gas resources. As much as 100 billion barrels of crude oil and 40 per cent of the world’s global gas reserves can be found in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Since the fall of communism, politicians and multi-national companies have struggled to possess and develop these resources.\nIn his penetrating new book, Lutz Kleveman reveals that there is a new ‘Great Game’ being played out in the region, a modern variant of the nineteenth-century clash of imperial ambitions between Britain and Russia, but with higher stakes. Desperate to wean itself from dependence on the OPEC cartel, the United States is now pitted in a struggle with Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Iran – most of which are nuclear powers – for dominance of the Caspian’s fabulous energy reserves and its pipeline routes.\nLutz Kleveman researched and travelled extensively in the Caucasus, the Caspian and Central Asia, meeting with oil barons, generals, diplomats and warlords from Kabul to Moscow. The New Great Game is a revelatory and extremely timely account of the perilous game to dominate the crucial resources – one that mixes religion and oil to explosive effect.\n–––––––\nFrom Scotland’s best traditional music outfit.\nIncludes the original track ‘Ambassador Craig Murray’s Reel’\n–––––––\nEastern Approaches – Fitzroy MaClean\nIn one breathtaking, breathless volume Fitzroy Maclean tells of his career as diplomat and soldier from 1937-45.\nThe first part of the book deals with his diplomatic career in the USSR. Maclean quickly tires of the endless cycle of diplomatic receptions and the restrictions upon travel, and decides to see more of the USSR, particularly the Central Asian republics that were still being assimilated into the Union. He sets off on a series of enlightening journeys (with little or no official approval!) that take him far from Moscow to the legendary cities of Samarkand and Bokhara. This is fine travel writing indeed, Maclean giving a very powerful sense of what the Stalinist era was like and also of the exoticism of Central Asia. There are also powerful descriptions of the Stalist purges of 1938 and the accompanying “show trials”.\nThe second part of the book covers Maclean’s exploits with the SAS in the North African deserts and the Middle East. Resigning from his diplomatic post to join the Army (using the convenient excuse of becoming an MP!) Maclean serves as a private in a Scottish regiment for some time before being commmissioned and sent to the Middle East. Here he falls in with David Stirling and becomes an early member of the SAS – his stories of their training, tactics and raids are powerful indeed, matched by evocative descriptions of the African landscapes. Maclean moves on to form SAS units in the Middle East, but before long is summoned to go behind enemy lines as Churchill’s military representative to Tito’s Yugoslav partisans.\nThe final third of the book mixes military action and politics, with Maclean organising the support for the Partisans and representing them to the Allies. The political agenda here is a little blurred – Maclean is obviously a Conservative who has instinctive support for the return of the Yugoslav monarchy, and yet he admires Tito for what he has achieved in the liberation of his own country, while still maintaining a personal anti-Communist agenda… This section of the book makes the sheer scale of the Partisan operations very apparent, and hints at the confusion between the Western allies over the future fate of Yugoslavia.\nThis is a splendidly readable book, full of incident and description, with vividly drawn characters. It is told with occasional gentle humour, modesty, and genuine insight.\nMaclean’s adventures arguably span the end of the “Great Game” – political influence won by adventurers – and the beginning of the Cold War, and his memoirs of this historical crossroads are thought-provoking and highly entertaining.\n–––––––\nThe Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East – Robert Fisk\nFisk’s first hand accounts of (in particular) the Iran-Iraq conflict, Operation Desert Storm, his meetings with Bin Laden, Lebanon, the gruelling iniquities of life in the occupied territories, the idiocy of the Bush administration and its arrogant and misguided lapdogs in Downing Street, the effects of depleted uranium weapons – to name just a few – are all fabulous bits of journalism placed within a sound historical context.\n–––––––\nMission to Tashkent – F M Bailey\n‘One of the best books about secret intelligence work ever written’ – Peter Hopkirk.\nColonel F. M. Bailey, whose extraordinary adventures are told here, was long accused by Moscow of being a British master-spy sent in 1918 to overthrow the Bolsheviks in Central Asia. As a result, he enjoyed many years after his death an almost legendary reputation there – that of half-hero, half-villain. In this remarkable book he tells of the perilous game of cat-and-mouse, lasting sixteen months, which he played with the Bolshevik secret police, the dreaded Cheka. At one point, using a false identity, he actually joined the ranks of the latter, who unsuspectingly sent him to Bokhara to arrest himself. Told with almost breathtaking understatement, Bailey’s narrative – set in a region once more back in the headlines – reads like vintage Buchan.\n–––––––\nImperialism: A Study – J A Hobson\nReview By Craig Murray\nI would argue this is the World’s most unjustly neglected book. One of the greatest books of political analysis ever written, unjustly neglected. Heavily plagiarised by Lenin, the work still cited as the best evidence of Lenin’s intellectual credentials was in fact Hobson’s, a British Liberal in the tradition of Cobden and Bright.\nHobson argued that an Empire impoverishes the ordinary citizens of the Imperial nation, while funnelling money to small governing elites and what we would now call the military-industrial complex. His profound insight is backed by the statistical analysis of the first class economist that Hobson was.\nOf course, this analysis is still valid today as the US taxpayer has spent, so far, $350 billion on the invasion and occupation of Iraq, while Exxon, Halliburton and the like make profits in unimaginable sums.\nI have often been asked why I gave up a brilliant and highly rewarding career to fight the new imperialism. Partly it was simply that no decent human being could go along with the things I saw. And partly it was because I understood the processes I was witnessing. In very large part, I understood those processes because, as a young man, I had read Hobson. He really ought to be required reading for anyone who wishes to take a view on what is behind the invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq, and the next one, be it Iran or elsewhere.\n–––––––\nCraig, I need information on where to get a copy of a book you published on elections on Ghana.\nNDC tried to shut down Joy FM, took Afari Gyan’s family hostage\nPingback: Israel: Condemned by Their Own Words – Counter Information\nPingback: Probable Western Responsibility for Skripal Poisoning Emerges | Tegenwicht Platform\nFor information – I just purchased Sikunder Burnes (£15.80) and The Catholic Orangemen of Togo (£9.60) from World of Books which I find a good alternative to Amazon.

On the other side of the ledger, as the successor state, it means that Russia got to keep all of the debt also. The agreement was finalised in 1993.\nIt appears certain that Westminster will insist upon being the successor state to the United Kingdom, and thus keep the seat on the UN Security Council, the nuclear weapons and the colonies. On the other side of the ledger, as the successor state, Westminster will get to keep the entire national debt too.\nThe independence of a state is a factor of its relationship to other states.

  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2010_06_i_hate_and_desp/content_27.html": "The Daily Telegraph kindly commissioned a major comment piece from me on Kyrgyzstan, which was published today.\nIt already seems to have fed through into analysis by the BBC’s resident correspondents, which is a good thing.\nA few months ago I wrote this:\nPersonally, if I had the chance to live in any town in the entire world, plus the seventh circle of Hell and an oxygenless planet off Alpha Centauri, London still might be bottom of my list.\nhttps://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2010/01/standing_down_a.html\nOn sober reflection, I was understating it. I deeply, deeply despise London. You will imagine the depth of my hatred if I tell you that, given the choice between eradicating London and eradicating Tony Blair, I would only opt for eradicating Tony Blair because it’s easier.\nMy only fixed appointment today was a simple interview shoot in Shoreditch, taking no more than half an hour. But I set off before noon and returned about six, spending five and a half hours in travelling from Acton to Shoreditch and back. I had walked to West Acton station by noon; spent one hour in going two stops to White City, where the train was terminated due to signals failure at Shepherd’s Bush. Central Line closed: on to the always disgusting, sepulchral Hammersmith and City line. That was only the start of a terrible, terrible return journey, of which the other chief highlight was a 27 minute wait for buses going down Hangar Lane.\nWhy do we put up with it? Tube systems in Paris, Warsaw, Brussels, St Petersburg, Moscow and Tashkent are infinitely more reliable than ours. My particular hatred is at the weekend, when all of the system that goes anywhere you might want to be shuts down completely, and all the stations continually announce “There is a good service apart from planned engineering work”.\nWhat the **** does that mean? “You can’t go anywhere, connections across the city are shut down, we are out for 60 hours, but it’s OK because this is planned total failure, not spontaneous total failure.”.\nDoes it make any difference to me if London Underground had planned to be total crap, or if they are doing it accidentally?\nThis has been going on for a decade. Billions upon billions of pounds have been ploughed in, extravagant foreign managements have been imported en masse. But I still can’t get on the Central Line from West Acton to Liverpool St.\nI hate London. There is no city on earth in which a family with an income of £30,000 per year would enjoy a worse standard of life. The private goods are too expensive and the public goods are worse managed than in the poorest third world country. There are much worse systems in third world countries, but billions upon billions less have been pumped into them. For value for money public services, nowhere is worse than London.\nDear all,\nI hate London short. I have lived in other towns. Thsi town is a rubbish. What is wrong with Londoners ? They like to play the false stars whether they go out on a weekend nights or whether they work in the City; City people who think that they are the choosen one in this world( which they are not by the way, because they are just the poorest wealthy people of the world, when you see what the same people can get in other towns in this world). And could someone explain me, why Londoners are so dumb, even though I know it is not all of them, but still. Why do they need to throw the rubbish on the streets? What do they think ? That this is going to dissapear like this the next day ? R they so silly that they cannot realise that they are the ones who will see the same tomorrow and….? can they not just keep it clean and keep the rubbish in their hands until they see a bin? What a filthy place London. I have come back from holidays, it is getting worse. I am not even sure that the so called poor country are as dirty as here. I am also astonished to hear people say that the prices for the tube and the houses are normal, BECAUSE IT IS LONDON. I dont give a damn what town it is, everybody should have the right to live in a decent place or have a good quality of life. Nevermind. Problem solved I am leaving this fitlthy rubbish bacteria and rat infested town, with the most complicated street system and its ignorant false posh stupid snobbish people who only think that what they dress like is what makes them important. Some Londoners neurons must be so damaged by this constant pollution in this rown plus the drugs they think it is cool and normal to use!!!!",

Confidential.” Meyer depicted Blair as starstruck and failing to stand up for Britain in the run-up to the Iraq war, and he described senior Cabinet members as “political pygmies.”\nIn the memoir, Meyer also told how, as a Downing Street press secretary, he would brief former Conservative Prime Minister John Major as the premier washed and dressed in the morning, sometimes while Major’s wife, Norma, lay in bed.\nForeign Secretary Jack Straw, who has accused Meyer of breaking a trust, published new guidelines Wednesday which specifically prevent Foreign Office staff from “writing anything that would damage the confidential relationship between ministers, or between ministers and officials.” Meyer’s book was submitted to the Cabinet Office which also consulted the Foreign Office before it was published.\nBritain’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, has published documents he says prove that Britain knowingly received intelligence extracted under torture from prisoners in the former Soviet state. Murray was sacked over the allegations.\nThe revised guidelines advise that “the good conduct of government requires ministers to have confidence that they can have full and frank discussions with officials, without concern that these may then appear in the public domain.”\nA review from The Herald\nEnemy Combatant. A British Muslim: Journey to Guantanamo and Back by Moazzam Begg with Victoria Brittain.\nOn that terrifying night in Islamabad in January 2002, normality drained from the life of Moazzam Begg, reducing him to a non-person. For the next three years he was invisible to all but his captors, his fellow internees and his interrogators, who interviewed him 300 times, never producing evidence of their terrorism accusations, never putting him on trial yet shackling and branding him as an enemy combatant, a threat to the United States.\nIf the words Guantanamo Bay were not so familiar we might think his was the story of a gulag in Soviet Russia. But it’s an ugly measure of our changed world that violating human rights is no longer the exclusive hallmark of barbarous regimes. It has crept into the unseen corners of George Bush’s war on terror.\nOne year on from the three in which he was held illegally by the American government ‘ first at the brutal holding camp of Bagram in Afghanistan and finally inside a steel cage at Guantanamo in Cuba ‘ Begg, a British Muslim from Birmingham, publishes his memoir today.\nThe book, remarkable for its lack of bitterness, coincides with increasing international pressure on the US to close Guantanamo. In Britain, politicians, judges, lawyers, human rights agencies and religious leaders have repeatedly denounced the camp for breaching the Geneva convention on the treatment of\nmilitary prisoners.",

Walks along the cliffs and beach and across Pegwell Bay with my family are a major part of my life. The sea has always been important to reviving my spirits. Ramsgate’s magnificent Edwardian esplanades stretch for miles, and the Ramsgate Society is now putting a commendable effort into their restoration. Ramsgate has almost entirely ceased to be a seaside holiday destination and I really do not quite understand why.\nAll these pictures are of places within an easy 15 minute walk of my house:\nThe depressingly ugly Turner Modern at Margate continues to attract the visitors, 99.99% of whom are blissfully ignorant of far greater art – and infinitely greater architecture – just down the road:\nThe lack of public interest in St Augustine’s and its highly limited opening hours (Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday afternoons only, from memory) appear to be a vicious circle.\nPegwell Bay still looks precisely as it did when Dyce painted it:\nRight on the street where I live we have a particularly good ghost story:\nAll this just one hour and ten minutes from St Pancras. Unfortunately Ramsgate town centre has suffered disastrously from the decision to build a huge out of town shopping centre at Westwood Cross, but is showing some first signs of revival.\nWant another reason to hate the big supermarkets? They are building a new Asda at the top of the High Street, and a fortnight ago the builders cut through a main sewer, flooding several houses including the local vet, where a number of recuperating animals in cages were drowned.\nHere is a picture of a jumbo coming in to land over Ramsgate, taken from the Open at Sandwich. You can see my house in this photo:\nI am baffled by the scheme to build a new airport in the Thames Estuary, when just down the road at Manston, and already right on Britain’s first HS1 High Speed Rail route, you have the second longest, now civil, runway in the UK, fully operational but working at 1% capacity. Manston can take the A380 without modification. I have seen proximity to Schiphol given as the reason Manston cannot be used, but it is further from Schiphol than Heathrow is from Gatwick.\nAnyway, time to pack…\nMore power to John Pilger. How many Pilgers and Fisks have we got left?\nA powerful piece by John Pilger – thanks for the link Azra.\n.\nChicksands\n.\nThe Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC) is located in a 12th Century Gilbertine Priory at Chicksands. The DISC is the UK Defence Agency responsible for training all personnel in psychological warfare.\n.\nThe unit shares space with the United States Air Force Security Unit.\n.\nIn the UK psyops has been renamed ‘Information Support'(IS) an decidedly Orwellian name change. Thousands of British service personnel have passed through the psyops course run by DISC.\n.\nA UK psyops or ‘black propaganda’ team worked during the Iraq war according to Major Taylor who explained the purpose of misinformation via radio and TV psyops stations, he clarified how the unit encouraged the Republic Guard to desert or face terrible consequences. An attempt to target Saddam in his bunker by a cruise missile was a classic botched psyops job.\n.\nThe same techniques have been tried in Iran after the Presidential elections with psyops operations recorded and uploaded to YouTube. In Libya and now Syria the team again target government forces encouraging them to desert or face the music. The technique involves showing pictures of officers who complied and then gross images of tortured victims who did not.\nhttp://www.davidsmail.info/harper.htm\nThis appears to be the guy writing on PressTV (about BBC). I had not read this before\nhttp://petereyrepatch.blogspot.com/\nTalk about brass neck. “We have asked for our plane back, and are awaiting their response” said Obama trying hard to hold back his laughter. A kid would be more bashful asking for his ball back from the neighbours yard, than the Yanks, asking for their spying kit.\n,\nThe notion of asking for their spying kit back is designed to make sense to whom? Is this some kind of denial about Iranians forcing down the oh so; stealthy, invisible, super duper, fandabidozi, technological marvel. In an attempt to distort the story to; RQ170 did an ET and has “phoned home”? ie the damn thing landed all by its little stealthy self, and rang home to be picked up after having had a chat with the natives?\n,\nFact that Iranians have spanked the yanks butt, aside, this turn of events still has not sunk in; Iran can and will look after herself. The predators always look for an easy meal/prey/victim, hence as any sane crack-head would do, Yanks ought to try and find a li’ll old lady that has left the bingo hall, instead of going after some guy whom can look after himself, in a manner of speaking sort of.\n@Antelope Gazer\n.\nThe only laziness here is your own. You clearly haven’t read the thing and that’s sufficiently demonstrated in your erroneous claim that the “full reckoning of the terrible sins of the Kwok Family” are as follows:\n.\n“Environment: Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) does not appear on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\nNonetheless, Sun Hung Kai Properties proudly boasts that it has won several awards for environmental\nexcellence.”\n.\nThat’s demonstrably not the case to anyone who reads the thing. Nor is what you claim of Jindal.\n.\nhttp://ifg.org/pdf/IFG_plutonomy.pdf\n.\nIf you want to be taken seriously I’d suggest you aim for factual accuracy, as a first step at least.\n.\nHarping on about typos or errors in verb agreement is a rather pubescent skill, but thus far the only skill you’ve demonstrated.\nPeter Eyre the man behind the ‘missing nukes’ yet by putting together a number of ‘Not for South Africa Eyes’ communications we realise the whole affair duped South Africa into providing Israel with a viable nuclear weapons program. That is the real secret.\nWhat exactly are you saying about Peter Eyre, Mark? His blog says, “If you support war in any shape or form please do not enter my space. If you are a Christian Zionist or Jewish Zionist please do not enter my space.” (and a whole lot more)\nNuid,\n.\nPeter is a respectable genuine chap compromised to a degree by twisted information from dubious sources.\nOk, Mark, thanks.\n@ Mark Golding. Others have referred to the creakability of the russian carrier. It is a heavily armed ship with Granite missile.\nGranite was the missile that was so secret the russians were prepared to go to war over whoever sunk the Kursk, to ensure no other nations, or individuals gained access to it. The Russian military deployed nuclear weapons on warplanes and on ships. They were told to deploy the nuclear weapons by someone not connected to the RG. The intelligence source told the Russians to prepare to fight an enemy that was not the United States, or NATO. And would most likely possess military technology far surpassing our best equipment\nA big problem we have in society is appointing legal people to run a business. They are no match for bankers. I remember the people who went into politics and those finance. The finance are happier and seem to have aged well. The politico’s on the other hand are close to death. The finance makes more income over the term because they have to think hard to keep winning while the politico is unable to think and syptom of bloated administration\nYes the pictures of your aree are nice craig.\n@ In my final procedure I will outline the reason why I need to act\n1 There is probably no easy way..to remove th cancer of badness without me acting\n2 Nato which means the USA with a coat on, much like the wolf in red riding hood, must stop its outright slaughter of humans\n3 Netanyahoo & Lieberman, i’m gonna beat the shit of of these turkey’s.

I knew these Naval men were still alive entombed in a metal coffin with 300 feet of water above them. Awful.\nMark,\nYes they died a horrible death. I think of them now and then.\nI feel uneasy pulling it all together, their suffering is painful. There was a reason the Russians deployed their most powerful weapons and that is all I can say.\nIt is difficult for me now because I am effectively gagged.

The Indian version of the \"terrorist attack\", most of whose victims were Muslim, has largely been accepted by Western governments without evidence. False flags abound nowadays. You may recall that we were told that the most deadly rocket ever fired by Hamas killed only Palestinians in a hospital compound, while the most deadly rocket ever fired by Hezbollah killed only Druze children. I have at present an open mind about what occurred in Kashmir. It is… Syria to Recognise Israel By End 2026 April 14, 2025: - A British diplomatic source tells me that \"President\" al-Jolani aka al-Sharaa has assured the UK that Syria will \"normalise relations\" with Israel, recognise the State of Israel and exchange ambassadors, by the end of 2026. This is part of a deal in exchange for substantial Western financial support and the lifting of sanctions on Syria. I asked whether the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Syria was part of the deal, and surprisingly this was not raised by either side. The UK regards it as a bilateral matter between Syria and Israel, and al-Jolani does not appear to prioritise Israeli… Trump, Tariffs and Trade April 11, 2025: - There is a giant problem that commentators are ignoring. The United States' trade deficit is of incredible proportions and is only sustainable because the dollar is the world's reserve currency - a status it is going to lose. The US trade deficit in 2024 was approximately 1.2 trillion dollars. GDP was approximately 30.1 trillion dollars. That's a trade deficit of an eye-watering 4% of GDP. By contrast, the EU had no significant trade deficit as a percentage of GDP. Zero. Even the chronic UK trade deficit was only 2.2% of GDP. Does it matter? Well, historically not much. The US,… Is This The World We Created? April 7, 2025: - It is all a part of the same phenomenon. Western governments actively assisting genocide in Gaza; attacks on benefits for the disabled; a deliberate official narrative of Russophobia; rampant Islamophobia boosting the rise of extreme right-wing parties and fuelled by government anti-immigrant rhetoric; an incredible accumulation of wealth by the ultra-rich; rampant erosion of freedoms of speech and expression. It is not happenstance that all of this is happening at the same time. It represents a radical shift in Western philosophy. This shift is not simple to trace because anti-intellectualism is an essential part of the new philosophy. Therefore this… Liberation Scotland April 2, 2025: - It is remarkable that few would dispute that Ireland was a British colony before most of it became Independent, but to point to Scotland's highly analogous colonial position brings howls of anger. All Empires employ the human resources of their colonies. India was conquered for the British by Indian soldiers, not by British troops. Nearly all of the major states in the Indian sub-continent were formally absorbed by Treaty, giving legal cover to the annexations. Throughout the British Empire, as so many other Empires, the local ruling class was co-opted into British rule, often selling out the interests and sometimes… Starmer’s Thatcherite Economics March 24, 2025: - You can only support the current manifestation of late-stage capitalism, if you believe that massive inequality of wealth is necessary to wealth creation, or if you believe that the total amount of wealth is unimportant so long as a very small minority are extremely wealthy. \"Trickledown economics\" is at heart simply a statement of the idea that massive inequality of wealth is necessary to wealth creation. There is no evidence for it. The truth is, of course, that the poor ultimately benefit only from the economic activity of the poor. But not nearly as much as the rich benefit from… Artificial Intelligence vs Corrupt Judges March 21, 2025: - The use of Artificial Intelligence raises complex issues, but you cannot bribe it or blackmail it, and while it is subject to overall political influence in its programming, how that will relate to individual subjects is in many ways unpredictable. Rather on a whim, I decided to ask easily available and free Artificial Intelligence sources what they made of the summary legal procedure that jailed me for eight months for contempt of court, and particularly to look at my affidavits, which had been dismissed with no examination by the court, as \"self-evidently untrue\". I asked Grok, Gemini and Copilot these… The Rot at the Core of “Democracy” March 18, 2025: - As 320 Palestinians were massacred last night, most of them women and children, we live in a world where it is accepted as legal that Trump2 is genocidally Zionist because he received a $100 million donation from Miriam Adelson to be so. In addition to which Adelson is the second largest donor to AIPAC, which openly pays hundreds of other elected and potential US politicians to be genocidally Zionist too. This is Western democracy. My previous article demonstrated how the argument – now used against Mahmoud Khalil – that the First Amendment only applies to US citizens, was also employed… The Curious Case of Mahmoud Khalil March 14, 2025: - Two key points the discussion has mostly missed: 1) It has been a bipartisan Justice Department policy for years to attempt to establish that the First Amendment does not apply to non-US citizens 2) Why has the Trump administration chosen Mahmoud Khalil out of thousands of potential victims; about as problematic a test case as can be imagined? First Amendment Protection The outrageous arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil by Immigration Control Enforcement is a new front in the widespread attack on free speech on Palestine in the USA. Indeed free speech on Palestine is under severe attack throughout almost… The Moral Balance March 12, 2025: - There is a logical fallacy that dominates European neoliberal \"thinking\" at the moment. It goes like this. \"Hitler had unlimited territorial ambition and proceeded to attempt conquest of all Europe after annexing the Sudetenland. Therefore Putin has unlimited territorial ambition and will proceed to attempt conquest of all Europe after annexing Eastern Ukraine.\" This fallacious argument gives no evidence of Putin's further territorial ambition. For evidence of Putin's threat to the UK, Keir Starmer risibly refers to the Salisbury \"novichok\" affair, perhaps the most pathetic propaganda confection in history. But even if you were to be so complacent as to… Alba Activism March 6, 2025: - There are two drivers behind my support for Scottish Independence. The first and most obvious is to see our ancient land restored to the place it held so long in the community of free and self-governing nations, and end the colonial exploitation of our people and resources. The second is to destroy that Imperialist rogue state, the United Kingdom. With the UK actively participating in the Gaza genocide through supply of arms, intelligence, military assistance and diplomatic cover, that need has become ever more acute. Were that not bad enough, the London government is now overtly militarist and looking to… Ukraine, Diplomacy and War March 3, 2025: - When politicians in power are extremely unpopular, they generally turn to militarism and jingoism for a quick boost. Starmer is now the darling of the UK media for his sabre-rattling over Ukraine and is busily churning out tweets of military imagery. In doing so he is attempting to pose as in defiance of Trump, and capitalise on Trump's unpopularity in the UK, even though just two days earlier he was fawning on Trump in the White House and inviting him on an \"unprecedented\" second State visit. As ever, there is a great deal of smoke and mirrors here. The European… Islamic Resistance Movements and Israel February 28, 2025: - We were searching for a site in the northern Bekaa valley recently bombed by Israel. Hadi knew near which village it was located but, as we drove between large expanses of fertile, well-cultivated fields, it was plain his information was vague. We pulled up at a garage to ask the way. Lebanon has not gone the way of Western economies in making consumers perform the very service for which they are paying, and in Lebanese service stations they still have attendants. A scruffily dressed old man sat on the front step of a dilapidated and very basic kiosk constructed of… UN Peacekeepers Watch Civilians Massacred February 12, 2025: - On 26 January, 26 unarmed civilians were shot dead by Israel and 147 wounded in a massacre observed by heavily armed UN Peacekeepers who did not intervene. I asked the UN the very hard questions which nobody else is asking them. The civilians were simply attempting to return to their homes in accordance with both UNSCR 1701 and the current ceasefire agreement, and indeed UNIFIL has a specific mandate under 1701 to assist displaced people to return. So what has gone wrong with UNIFIL? Is this Srebrenica syndrome? What is the purpose of the heavy weaponry deployed by the UN's… United Nations Censures UK Over Abuse of Terrorism Act Against Journalists and Activists February 6, 2025: - Four UN Special Rapporteurs have written jointly to the UK government demanding explanation of its inappropriate persecution of journalists and political activists under the Terrorism Act. They state that those persecuted: appear to have no credible connection to \"terrorist\" or \"hostile\" activity The cases taken up by the United Nations are those of Johanna Ross (Ganyukova), John Laughland, Kit Klarenberg, Craig Murray (yes, me), Richard Barnard and Richard Medhurst. The UN letter is signed by: Ben Saul Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism Irene Khan Special Rapporteur on the promotion… Israel Slaughters and Destroys in Southern Lebanon January 31, 2025: - We could very easily - in fact more easily - have made these mini-documentaries featuring the bodies of children slaughtered by Israel and the hideous aspect of the maiming of tens of thousands, or focusing on the tears of the bereaved and orphaned. We chose to go a different way and make that unavoidably implicit, but not shown, in the interests of attracting and engaging the widest audience possible. Yet I believe what we do show highlights Israeli barbarity and makes it stark in another way. I would be grateful for your thoughts. ----------------------- To be blunt, our three months… Israeli Atrocities in Lebanon January 27, 2025: - Yesterday, not only did Israel fail to evacuate its army from Southern Lebanon as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, Israel also shot over 130 Lebanese civilians attempting to return home in accordance with the deal, killing 23 and wounding 109 (of whom some are in critical condition). This included a 12 year old boy wounded in the neck in Kfarkela, standing right next to my local producer Mahmood. I was twenty yards away and on my way to them. Four were killed in Kfarkela and overnight the Israeli army demolished numerous homes there in \"punishment\". Over 100 people shot by… Real Reporting Appeal January 18, 2025: - Our new mini-documentary from the Middle East shows again the kind of reporting that no Western media either can or will do. We hope to visit Damascus where Western media is giving entirely sycophantic and false coverage to the new HTS regime, praising the return of Pringles to the shops while ignoring massacres. But we are completely out of funding. I have made an overall loss now in five figures on our work in the Middle East since October. There has been not one mainstream journalist here showing the truth of Israeli bombing and occupation in Lebanon. There are some… A Ceasefire is Not an End January 16, 2025: - The Genocide of the Palestinian people began 76 years ago. What may be drawing to a close is merely a particularly intense phase in the Genocide. Gaza is destroyed. 92% of its housing has gone. Its water treatment and sanitation, electricity generation, food processing, farming, and fishing are all now incapable of sustaining much life. Its hospitals, health centres, universities, colleges, and schools are all now destroyed, as are its municipal buildings, waste disposal, road surfaces, drainage channels, theatres, cultural centres, cinemas, cafés. What is left is 1.8 million cold and starving people, malnourished, soaked, ill-clothed, living in tents and… The United States’ Pet General Appointed President of Lebanon January 10, 2025: - Yesterday I did two short video reports from outside the Lebanese Parliament - inside a military cordon that totally sealed off downtown Beirut - on the appointment of General Joseph Aoun, Head of the Lebanese Armed Forces, as President of Lebanon. There is no other Western source giving any of this detail - not even that it is directly unconstitutional for a present or former Head of the Armed Forces to become President in Lebanon.

The French and Saudis were actually in the room at parliament.\nThe Guardian sees this as “helpful” international diplomacy.\nThe Hezbollah-Israel war, as well as external pressure, had seemingly helped finally overcome that gridlock on Thursday. In the days before the election, a series of diplomats visited Beirut to hold talks with the main political figures.\nFor 13 months and 14 failed elections, Hezbollah and their allies had blocked the appointment of General Aoun. That he is the United States and Israel’s man is not in doubt. Despite Hezbollah attempting to make the most of their having voted for Aoun in the final round, to rescue what credit they could from the inevitable, this is no doubt another defeat for them following the disastrous ceasefire agreement that led to the same-day start of the assault on their ally Assad.\nThere is one stark and undeniable truth. The United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia have gained massively in the geopolitics of the Middle East. Iran’s position has been very seriously weakened. Panglossian attempts to downplay this by anti-Imperialists, with whom I sympathise, are unhelpful.\nBoth Syria and Lebanon have in the last month gained new leaders whose chief qualification for office is that they both commanded military forces which did not fire a single shot against Israeli invasion and occupation of their countries.\nThe Greater Israel project is well underway, with Saudi and Turkish agreement in exchange for the suppression of Shia Islam in the remaining Arab territories. Aoun’s appointed role is as a hammer against Hezbollah.\nFinally, and just for fun, if you want to know what the new leadership style feels like:\nTo be blunt, our two months in Lebanon before Christmas made a slight financial loss. I was delighted with the output of four mini-documentaries and numerous short video reports and articles, some of which individually had millions of viewers. But to date the model of reader-sponsored real overseas journalism is not proven nor stable.\nIf you have not yet contributed financially, I should be grateful if you could do so.

Lets face it Jordan has been very quiet throughout all this but its location is bang in the middle so if Israel has plans to expand it is likely it will take Jordan or parts of it anyway.Trump wants Israel to release some of the thousands of Palestinians it has in prisons , in exchange for the Israeli women children and older men Hezbollah has in Gaza and he wants it done this week , Netanyahu and his military generals , zionist , have been told by Trump that this will happen , Netenyahu,s generals have said that if it does , they are resigning , they want Gaza destroyed completely and everyone in it, lets see what happens next.\nThe Abbas regime is a Quisling regime, as everyone in the Middle East knows.\nI don’t know what will happen next, but on several occasions in the past (and not just the recent past) there has been talk of an imminent deal and the Zionists have then carried out a terrorist attack to scupper it.\nInteresting that the Kushner family’s pals known as the oil sheikhs of the UAE are being put forward as possible hosts of a Putin-Trump meeting.\nThat all this seems to feature Trump adds to the uncertainty, but I won’t be surprised if there’s a major financial crash before the end of next week. Why? Because markets are where the money is, and if you’ve got the power to do something to decide the timing of the inevitable, there’s a lot of money in that power.\nThe Palestinian resistance have signalled their approval of a deal, according to grownup media (PressTV in Iran). But Britain too signalled their approval of a deal on the Chagos islands and appear to have been told to shove it up their backsides.\nWhatever is happening is not the wielding of charisma by Trump, because he’s only got charisma where wrestling fans are concerned.\nHamas Fatah and the PA have all caved in , money talks , none of them will risk their existence to save the people in Gaza or Lebanon , we can forget a two state agreement that Norway is trying to broker , Israelis want Palestinians destroyed if they wont leave and as we have seen over many years wave after wave of young Palestinians grow up and fight for their land , THEIR LAND .Israel on its own would have been unable to do what it has done in Palestine Lebanon Syria Egypt Iran thats a fact , so the blame lies with the bullies in the background the deceivers , the liars , the evil axis that has financed these wars , namely USA UK France.\n‘If they won’t leave’ is a non sequitur as they are barricaded into Gaza, and are trying to sustain traditional ways of life in the West Bank. Unless there is agreement for an international rescue plan, to enable Palestinians to uproot and move to other countries, safely, then they appear to be doomed\nPalestinians belong in Palestine, that is their right.\nAny moral rescue plan should concentrate on removing all the zionist Jews out of Palestine to other genocidally sympathetic countries like the USA, for example.\nZionists aren’t Jews; Jews are decent people with an attachment to a form of superstitious mumbo-jumbo, they don’t steal countries off people and exterminate the rightful owners.\nExcuse me but, I believe you’ll find every Israeli passport holder is a jew. The overwhelming majority of Israelis support the genocidal policies of their government. Zionists believe in the exceptionalism of Jews, ie. their ultimate superiority over every other person on the planet. Therefore, I’d posit that most zionists are Jews, recognising though that not all Jews are zionists.\nApologies if you were being ironic and I missed it.\n“Zionists aren’t Jews”\nThe overwhelming majority of the members of the Israeli terrorist regime are Zionist Jews, with no other religion significantly represented.\nApproximately 74% of eligible voters in Israel are Jewish Zionists. These individuals directly affect what happens in Israel regarding Palestinians.\nAdditionally, 90%-95% of those who are in direct, physical contact with Palestinians in the West Bank are Jews. And of course, it is Jews, not evangelical Christians, who are in direct contact with Palestinians in Israel (those with Israeli citizenship).\nregarding “not all Jews are zionists”..\nthere are around 15 million Jews worldwide, with 7 million living in Israel. over 90% of Israeli Jews identify with some form of Zionism. recent surveys indicate that a significant majority of American Jews support the existence of Israel as a Jewish state. For instance, the American Jewish Committee’s 2024 Survey of American Jewish Opinion found that 85% of American Jews believe it is important for the U.S. to support Israel in the aftermath of October 7. additionally, a 2024 survey by the Manhattan Institute revealed that 86% of Jewish voters support Israel.\nbased on this, it’s fair to state that at least 80% of Jews worldwide are Zionists. so yes, you could state “not all Jews are not zionists,” but on the other hand, 8 out of 10 Jews are Zionists.\n1. Right of return for all Palestinian refugees and their descendants.\n2. De-recognition of Israel and criminalisation of Zionism. (Cf. derecognition of the German Third Reich and criminalisation of Nazism).\n3. Seizure of the assets of former Zionist big players, including all assets formerly held on a “sovereign” basis. Basically Israel must be no more.\n4. Reparations to be paid out of those (enormous) assets, including to help refugees, the wounded, and the bereaved – which is practically the entire Palestinian population.\n5. Peaceful and humanitarian repatriation from Palestine of all former members of the supremacy who hold other citizenships. I don’t know what the % is, but it’s quite high and the spread includes most leading countries – the USA, Russia, Britain, Australia, France, Germany, Poland, Hungary, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if the % is as high as 80% or 90%, bearing in mind that many hold citizenship even if they don’t hold a current passport. If there are countries that have removed citizenship from those who have “become recognised as Israelis”, they should return their former citizenships when Israeli citizenship no longer exists. If this is done on a descendancy basis, the problem basically disappears. I.e. if someone’s grandparents immigrated to the supremacy in Palestine from Poland, give them Polish citizenship. If they’re hard up, cover the cost of their learning Polish. For those who wish to become Palestinians – fine – let them. We’re for a secular state after all.\nin a reply he posted at 12.10 this morning to a comment I’d posted earlier GratedApe linked to a piece on the CSTs website from July 2015 about Jeremy Corbyn associating with antisemites (which is well worth reading, although most people who follow Craig have no doubt heard/read articles like it before). And maybe one or two of them are, and others despise Israel for the obvious reasons. And THAT is my point! That but for the Israeli zionists stealing most of historical Palestine by force and fear and subjugating them ever since, it seems highly HIGHLY unlikely to me that this ill-feeling and, in some cases, antisemitism would exist. But, my god, don’t Palestinian people and Arabic people – even before the ongoing genocide – have every reason to hate and despise Israeli Jews/zionists. Of course they do, and I have no doubt that the zionist mafia leadership have for decades thoroughly enjoyed doing whatever to increase such feelings, being the psychopathic sadistic fascist scum that they are.\nAnyway, the above chain of thoughts – triggered by the CTS article GratedApe linked to – led to me doing a search re >are israeli jews indoctrinated to hate and despise palestinians from an early age< and, as such, came across a number of articles in the results, including this one, in Haaretz, from August 3rd, 2023, albeit most of it behind a paywall, but here's what's visible:\nAnalysis | From the First Grade to the Grave, Israelis Are Taught to Dehumanize Palestinians\nThe Israeli Palestinian Bereaved Families for Peace, which brings students together with Israeli and Palestinian bereaved families, is being targeted by the right for daring to offer an alternative to the endless cycle of blood\nThe Israeli Palestinian Bereaved Families for Peace, a grassroots organization promoting reconciliation, has been experiencing in recent years what Breaking the Silence went through before: a ludicrous branding as enemies of the people, systematic threats, and attempts to sabotage any public appearance, as well as a ban…\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-08-03/ty-article/.premium/from-the-first-grade-to-the-grave-israelis-are-educated-to-dehumanize-palestinians/00000189-b817-d821-afdd-bb37927a0000\nAnd also this on Aljazeera, from December, 2023:\nIt’s not shocking to see Israeli children celebrate the Gaza genocide\nIsrael has long been indoctrinating its children to believe Palestinians are less than human, and thus not worthy of empathy or compassion.\nIn November, Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, uploaded on its official X page a video of Israeli children singing a song celebrating their country’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The broadcaster deleted the video clip after a huge online backlash.\nEven after the video was silently erased from social media, however, the song remained a subject of discussion and controversy. Many across the world were shocked to see children sing happily about “eliminating” an entire people “within one year”. Yet a closer look at Israeli literature and curricula shows this open celebration of genocide was the only natural outcome of Israel’s persistent indoctrination – or brainwashing to be more blunt – of its children to ensure that they do not view Palestinians as human and fully embrace apartheid and occupation…\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/12/13/its-not-shocking-to-see-israeli-children-celebrate-the-gaza-genocide\nPersonally I would rephrase the bit about 'Israel's persistant indoctrination', and replace it with 'the zionist mafia leadership's persistant indoctrination'. Anyway, there were a couple more articles that came up in the results, but they all say essentially the same thing, like this piece by Asa Winstanley in the Middle East Monitor from July, 2019:\nHow Israel teaches its children to hate\nhttps://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190726-how-israel-teaches-its-children-to-hate/\nAnd my MAIN point is this: That you can be absolutely certain that anti-Palestinian and anti-Arab hate speech is rife among many Israeli Jews, along with Islamophobia of course.\nNB When I did the search, most of the results that came up were about antisemitism and Palestinians, which obviously gets a lot more press. And needless to say, there are many good caring empathetic Israeli Jews who empathise with the plight of the Palestinians.\nAlso came across this abhorrent piece of propaganda in the results, from October 26th, 2023. Here’s a taster:\n‘Why My Generation Hates Jews’\nMy peers have been indoctrinated to believe that Jews are oppressors. And so even our mass slaughter is seen as justifiable revenge.\nI am 21 years old and Jewish. Apparently, 48 percent of my peers want people like me dead.\nAs of October 23, 64 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds think what happened on October 7 was a terrorist attack. Seventy-seven percent of us think “it’s true that Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 Israeli civilians by shooting them, raping and beheading people including whole families, kids and babies.”\nhttps://www.thefp.com/p/why-my-generation-hates-jews\nIt’s just pure hasbara. “48% of my peers want people like me dead” came up on this card-carrying partisan fighter’s smartphone.\nDehumanisation of Palestinians is an issue. Anti-semitism is not an issue, any more than “rights for whites” is in Britain.\nI linked to that Corbyn article in looking for the first concerns raised about his possible leadership, as you had brought up as you know.\n“zionists stealing most of historical Palestine by force and fear”\nWasn’t most of it passed from Muslim Ottomans to Christian Brits to Zionist Jews? Did the Turkish and British empires steal it first? If so how is that to be rectified?\nJust checked out Stop the War’s website and the march on the 18th is going ahead, only assembling in Whitehall instead:\nPalestine Coalition statement in response to Met Police ban – 13 January 2025\nLast week, the Metropolitan Police publicly confirmed its intention to prevent our planned protest at the BBC on Saturday 18 January, by imposing an exclusion order banning Palestine solidarity protestors from entering the area surrounding the BBC throughout the day. We will not be silenced.\nSince the Police announced their imposing of orders to prevent a protest at the BBC, nearly 200 MPs, trade union and civil society leaders and groups including Amnesty International UK and Akiko Hart, Director of Liberty, Holocaust survivors and their descendants, lawyers, journalists and prominent cultural figures have spoken out in support of the right to protest. Today, they have been joined by over 700 members of the Jewish community…\nWe are calling on all those who support an immediate ceasefire and an end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, as well as everyone who believes in the democratic right to protest, to join us in London at 12 noon on Saturday 18 January. We will assemble in Whitehall, which will allow us to form up in massive numbers, and we will march in an orderly fashion towards the BBC. We call on the Metropolitan Police to drop these repressive restrictions and accept our right to demonstrate at the BBC.\nhttps://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/we-will-march-against-israels-genocide-and-bbc-bias/\nThis was posted the same day:\nA Jewish statement against police ban on Palestine protest\nThe Palestine Solidarity marches are no threat to jews\nProminent legal, cultural and academic figures are among more than 660 British Jews calling on the Metropolitan Police to reverse a ban on a pro-Palestine protest assembling at the BBC in London next Saturday.\nThe statement below, signed by senior lawyers Sir Geoffrey Bindman KC and Sir Stephen Sedley KC, author Gillian Slovo, actress Miriam Margolyes and singer/songwriter Leon Rosselson, criticises the ban as bowing to “partisan campaigning aimed at preventing peaceful and lawful assembly.”\nThe Met had faced strong pressure from pro-Israel organisations opposed to demonstrations against the genocide going on in Gaza, claiming that Palestine solidarity protests pose a threat to synagogue congregations. This evidence-free claim is robustly contradicted by the large Jewish Bloc visible on every major demonstration since the genocide began in October 2023.\nOther members of the Jewish community opposing the police decision include Rabbi Jeffrey Newman, writer and director Adam Gantz, Professors Moshe Machover and Jacqueline Rose, writer/comedian Alexei Sayle, Stephen Kapos and other Holocaust survivors and descendants…\nhttps://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/a-jewish-statement-against-police-restrictions/\nAnd there was also another article consisting mainly of the text to an EDM, along with a link to it. Here’s the actual EDM, and the first part of the motion, so far signed by just 29 MPs, and not a single Tory or LibDem in sight. Or any of Starmer’s stasi of course:\nMotion text\nThat this House is alarmed by attempts by the Metropolitan Police to prevent an agreed march for Palestine from protesting at the BBC on 18 January 2025; notes the route for the march was confirmed with the police nearly two months ago and as agreed with them was publicly announced on 30 November 2024; believes that the BBC is rightly accountable to the public and that police powers should not be used to shield it from democratic scrutiny; rejects the Metropolitan Police’s claim the march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue …\nhttps://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/62984#tab-supporters\nOMW, just came across this on the JC, posted yesterday:\nVast majority of Jews support police march ban\nCommunity leaders representing the overwhelming majority of British Jewish opinion have applauded the Metropolitan Police’s decision to prevent an upcoming pro-Palestine march from starting near a central London synagogue [albeit 500m away from BBC HQ, and the route of the march went no-where near it].\nIt comes after the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and Stop the War Coalition, the organisers behind the Gaza march on January 18, tried to co-opt fringe, anti-Israel Jewish voices to back their campaign [there’s at least three falshoods in that one sentence alone, but we all know how talented and proficient the zionist psychopathic fascists are at lying and fabricating and smearing, and misleading and manipulating people, as such].\nAnd further on in the article:\nBut leaders in the Jewish community have urged the Met not to give into pressure from the protesters. The Jewish Leadership Council, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Community Security Trust released a joint statement on Tuesday in support of the Met’s position.\n“This Saturday’s National March for Palestine must not take place in the vicinity of BBC given its proximity to a synagogue and the impact on worshippers,” the statement said. “We support the right to peaceful protest and are not asking for this march to be banned….”\nOh, well that’s good to hear, cos it’s these same organisations along with some really obnoxious people who have been calling for the marches to be banned since last year. That said, they are lying about people needing protection, as they say in their statement:\n“However, we support the Metropolitan Police in imposing conditions to protect those who are attending Central London synagogues..”\nAnd a little further on it says the following:\n.Two-thirds of British Jews said they would avoid city centres where pro-Palestine protests were taking place for fear of their safety, according to an Institute for Jewish Policy Research survey published last October.\nWell if that’s legit, then how did this fear come about. Not through the marchers or anything they’ve done, of course, but through the lies and falsehoods and fear-mongering of fascist scum, including the MSM and Jewish newspapers. And how evil is that!\nAnd needless to say, these people don’t give a flying fuck about antisemitism!\nForgot, then remembered, and then forgot again…\nhttps://www.thejc.com/news/pro-palestine-march-must-avoid-synagogue-jewish-leaders-say-q5j05wt0\nThere was also this on the JC, posted yesterday:\nBen-Gvir claims credit for blocking hostage deal multiple times since summer\nThe far-right minister said he would quit the coalition if deal was reached with Hamas\nhttps://www.thejc.com/news/israel/ben-gvir-outrage-blocked-hostage-deal-k9jw9ia8\nI have no doubt that BN was doing his utmost as well, and for a number of obvious reasons, one of them being that he just totally lurves murdering and maiming and nightmaring Palestinian babies and todlers and children and women and pregnant women and the elderly and non-combatant men. The guy is a mega-sadistic inhuman monster, as are the rest of the zionist fascist leadership.\nAND Biden and Blinken and Starmer and Lammy et al.\nIndeed – in the ToI as well.\nSmotrich is the real baddie.\nhttp://Www.timesofisrael.com%2Fben-gvir-says-he-repeatedly-foiled-hostage-deals-urges-smotrich-to-help-him-stop-this-one\nBen Gvir and Smotrich are determined to prevent this latest hostage deal\nSmotrich is the one most openly determined to erase Palestinians from the West Bank and has changed laws to make it legal to kill them and take their land, and illegal for Jews to purchase from them.\nSpeaking on the children, last month there was a survey put out that said:\n“Death feels imminent for 96% of children in Gaza, study finds”\n“The findings are harrowing: 96% of children surveyed feel their death is imminent, while 49% have expressed a desire to die.”\n–\n“The survey found that 92% of children were “not accepting of reality”, 79% suffered from nightmares, and 73% displayed symptoms of aggression. Other psychological responses included fear, anxiety, social withdrawal, and difficulty concentrating”.\nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/death-feels-imminent-96-children-gaza-study-finds\nThe cruelty by Israel/West is unfathomable. And when just 1 one these children grow up and do this or that act in retaliation against Israel, that palestinian will be framed as an irrational, fanatical terrorist.\nIt is absurd that there is no understanding whatsoever what kind of blowback there will be from this mass carnage by Israel.\nYou have atleast some 50000 killed, that mean you have some 50000 people wanting to seek revenge against Israel.\nThe Zionists understand that point very well, Jack.\nIt relates to why they say for example they don’t want Jewish mothers in the same maternity wards as Palestinian mothers, because “Your baby’s going to grow up to want to kill us”.\nAnd at this point one can see the connection between the Zionist state-focused mentality and the traditional dehumanising racism of the religion, as has been astutely observed by among others the writer Israel Shahak.\nBasically someone’s looking for some fighting in London between British regime forces and supporters of the Palestinians before presidential inauguration day in one of the North American countries next Monday.\nMoon of Alabama with an assessment today.\nQuoting media reports on how Witkoff apparently forces Netanyahu’s hand:\n“Last Friday evening, Steven Witkoff, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, called from Qatar to tell Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s aides that he would be coming to Israel the following afternoon. The aides politely explained that was in the middle of the Sabbath but that the prime minister would gladly meet him Saturday night.\nWitkoff’s blunt reaction took them by surprise. He explained to them in salty English that Shabbat was of no interest to him. His message was loud and clear. Thus in an unusual departure from official practice, the prime minister showed up at his office for an official meeting with Witkoff, who then returned to Qatar to seal the deal.”\nMoA ending on this note:\n“The genocide enablers of the Biden administration are on their way out. The new administration will probably have stopped the genocide even before it enters its office. In this case elections did matter.\nBut stopping the genocide does not make a Trump administration less friendly to Israel’s greed for extension. In whatever may follow a ceasefire we can be sure that Trump will (again) take Israel’s side.”\nhttps://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/01/trumps-action-demonstrates-bidens-failure-in-stopping-the-genocide.html#more\nNone of this, as he correctly predicts changes the structures of power. And the consequences for the populations. Such a shift – just as with “the empire” as a whole – will most likely take decades. Either by some bigger war or economic exhaustion. Both – at least the second option – by a time, Trump has long been out of office.\nAs Iran is concerned, there were reports that the Bidens did discuss to try taking out the facility for building nukes and the major command centers. The question here too will be if the revolution in military affairs which we have witnesses will alter the behaviour of the Israelis e.g.\nThey did call back an air attack when their planes were locked on by Iranian AD.\nI wonder in how far diplomacy will ever be able to influence anyhting. If the Israelis have managed one thing it’s shattering the trust in human decency and agreement on universal conduct towards other humans. Force as potentially the only lingua franca. That by people who claim to come from Judaistic traditions!\nNetanyahu doesn’t keep kosher and couldn’t give a monkey’s for the Sabbath.\nEven if he could, this is just chaff.\nWhat I would like to know is whether Steven Witkoff is close to Chabad.\nThose who control “Forward”, formerly the Jewish Daily Forward, seem to think Trump’s cabinet is ZOG to the core:\nhttps://forward.com/news/674101/trump-cabinet-israel-rubio-huckabee-jewish/\n(This is from 13 Nov 2024.)\n“President-elect Donald Trump has filled much of his cabinet, rolling out nominations that feature people deeply connected to the Jewish and pro-Israel communities, including Mike Huckabee, Steve Witkoff, and Marco Rubio.\nHis first national security picks are die-hard Israel supporters, some of whom have denied the existence of the Palestinian people and back the annexation of the occupied West Bank. These loyalists are set to advance his “America First” and hardline populist agenda in a second term. They could signal some shifts in longstanding U.S. policy, especially regarding a possible conflict with Iran and resolving conflicts in the Middle East.”\nCould Binyamin Netanyahu be about to go into Zionazi history as a moderate who was too soft on the Palestinians, the same way not only Yitzhak Rabin did but also the butcher Ariel Sharon did?\nFFS! But it could happen.\nI’d say what we’re seeing is just the return to something resembling normal service in the US-Israel relationship. The US always allowed Israel to go so far but when its actions started adversely affecting US interests they would be forced to stop. But Biden seems to have been away with the fairies for who knows how long. When Israel crossed that line, he would bleat. But he’d never actually pick up the phone and order the Treasury to tear up the cheques and the arms supply flights to turn round. Netanyahu knew this and took full advantage. Whether the resulting damage to the US itself at this critical point where global power is shifting or to Israel, which has quite likely destroyed itself as residents and investors flee, can ever be undone remains to be seen.\nAll this talking up of a cease fire, whilst Napoleon Satanyahu assures his right wing pals that the war will continue whatever agreent is reached, is more of the same shiningly dark news fodder to confront the daily kills, cold, diseases and hunger in the rightful populus of occupied Palestine.\nI am fed up with this crap.\nRenewed my Palestinian flag on our house for a bigger one and also raised one in the back garden for all to see from the road.\nAll business transactions of the occupied forces and inside Israhell should now be sanctioned with steep tarifs, arms sales should be stopped, and personal sanctions on Likud cabinet members enacted.\nEverything and Nothing will change next week as we all move to Trumptonshire.\nTwo related reports, highlighting an essential commodity under the control of zionists :\n“Israel’s incursion into southern Syria highlights its ongoing water ambitions. Reports indicate that Tel Aviv now controls 40 percent of Syria and Jordan’s shared water resources. Following its takeover of the Al-Wehda Dam in the Yarmouk Basin in December, Israeli forces then advanced to the Al-Mantara Dam. ”\nhttps://thecradle.co/articles/stealing-water-israels-covert-war-on-syria-lebanon-and-jordan\n“In 1994, Stewart and Lynda Resnick, a billionaire couple, gained control over nearly 60% of an important California water resource, built with hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money. …\nThrough their foundation, the Resnicks have donated substantial sums annually to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), … Beyond direct military support, the Resnicks have funded educational institutions closely linked to Israel’s military and intelligence sectors. … Additionally, they have been involved with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank that originated as an extension of AIPAC”.\nhttps://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2025/01/13/the-resnicks-la-california/\nPathetic to read about the alleged ceasefire, the fifth-columnist Anthony Blinken already put the onus on palestinians if the deal is to be upheld, that is after Israel breached the lebanese “ceasefire” from day one and will of course breach this one too and unleash hell since they know no israelis are left in Gaza and the blame for the breach will of course be blamed on the palestinians.\nThe released palestinians prisoners will of course be arrested, killed as soon as possible by Israel. The phoney arab world have made it again, been the facilitator for the same regime that despise and kill their ethnic group right in front of them. Obviously we are talking about imbeciles. Jesus these people are stupid.\nAnd the disgraceful Palestinian Authority keep their resistance up, but not against Israel but against their own people, when palestinians face the most critical time in their history the PA instead see a power struggle against other palestinian groups. To be frank, what a heinous pack of people:\nPalestinian Authority must run Gaza after war, prime minister says\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-authority-must-run-gaza-after-war-prime-minister-says-2025-01-15/\nI’m pretty confident, that as soon as the (Israeli) hostages are free and safe – that the Zionists will break any ceasefire – like they have done with the previous one, how could Hamas be so gullible to believe that ANY ceasefire will hold.\n“Israel and Hamas have struck a deal that secures the release of all hostages held by the Palestinian militant group, US President-elect Donald Trump has announced\n“We have a deal for the hostages in the Middle East,” Trump posted on his TruthSocial platform on Wednesday. “They will be released shortly.”\nAccording to multiple media outlets, the agreement approved in Qatar involves a 42-day ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners, including all Israelis taken captive in the October 7, 2023 Hamas incursion from Gaza. “\nKey Terms, of the Ceasefire – the Zionists will never live up to them.\n“Israeli forces are required to fully withdraw from all areas of the Gaza Strip and return to the pre-war borders.\nThe Rafah crossing must be reopened, with Israeli forces withdrawing entirely from the area.\n“Israel” is mandated to ease the travel of injured individuals for treatment abroad.\n“Israel” must permit the daily entry of 600 aid trucks, as per a humanitarian protocol backed by Qatar.\n“Israel” must facilitate the entry of 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans for immediate shelter.\nA large-scale prisoner exchange will occur, including the release of 1,000 prisoners from Gaza and hundreds of detainees serving lengthy sentences.\n“Israel” is to release all women and children under the age of 19 from its prisons.\nIsraeli forces must gradually withdraw from the Netzarim corridor and the Philadelphi Route.\nDisplaced residents must be allowed to return to their homes, with guaranteed freedom of movement throughout the Gaza Strip.\nHostile aircraft must vacate Gaza’s airspace for 8 to 10 hours daily.\nAll hospitals in Gaza must be rehabilitated. Field hospitals, medical equipment, and surgical teams must be permitted entry.”\nAnd of course no control mechanism that the deal will be upheld at all, no mechanism to note possible ceasfire violations – just like Israel wants. This is a joke, but do not blame the gazans, this is the Arab leaders fault that are always eager to appease the americans/israel.\nThe rotten Arab League should, if they were humans, put forwards demands in the deal along the lines like: confiscation of israeli means all over the world and making sure Israel pay for the destruction and for everyone they killed. A deal should include real efforts to put the responsible in Israel in charge and stopping any arab/israeli normalization before every one of these demands are met.\nNow, the equally rotten West will have to pay, once again, for Israel’s destruction.\nOut of interest, have the Israelis ever claimed to treat Palestinian prisoners well and with respect, the way that Hamas have claimed to treat occupation prisoners?\nOr would the Zionist mentality view such a claim as humiliating and tantamount to accepting that the Arab man (or child) is holding the whip hand over the Jewish man, to use the notorious words of the British white supremacist Enoch Powell? (Although to be fair to Powell, I don’t think he ever raped any prisoners, stole their credit cards, or said it was cool to shoot unborn children in the womb. Any Zionist makes Powell look like a liberal. Many forget, even now, just how extreme the Zionist mentality is.)\nIMO. Enoch Powell was a realist, certainly not a white supremacist, and most of what he warned would happen has happened. There’s a lot of BS around his ‘rivers of blood’ speech, with lots of misinformation about what he actually said as opposed to what some people believe he said. He was a political football for the likes of Heath and the lefty liberals of that time. We are now living the reality of what he prophesied, only worse.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech\nFunny how people never mention the actual racist speeches of the likes of Churchill.\n@Stevie – How can you say Powell wasn’t a white supremacist when he wanted Britain to be a white country?\nChurchill was undoubtedly a racist, but I’m not sure what he’s got to do with it.\nYou talk about all the BS about Powell’s speech, in which the actual words “rivers of blood” do not appear, but then link to a Wikipedia article, whereas the actual speech itself is online:\nhttps://anth1001.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/enoch-powell_speech.pdf\nNever forget the context of his speech, namely his opposition to the bill that became the second Race Relations Act (the 1968 one), which criminalised racial discrimination in housing and employment. He was in favour of racial discrimination in housing and employment remaining legal, e.g. “Room to let – no blacks, no dogs, no Irish”. The man was a racist gutternsnipe for all his classical scholarship, skill with rhetoric, and undoubted command of the English language.\nThe Race Relations Act had nothing to do with subsequent immigration. It was to do with equal rights in this country.\nWe’ll have to agree to disagree on this, discrimination against the WASP community is today a real thing.\nI can’t say I’m surprised by this – nor am I surprised that EU bigwigs have not only turned a blind eye to the Zionists genocide, but in some cases actually aided and abetted them.\n“An eye opening episode of the investigative journalism show, Report, aired on Sunday January 12, 2025, by Italy’s state broadcaster Rai TV, exposed the high level of lobbying activity by Israeli groups inside the European institutions over the past two decades.”\n“The show revealed how more than 20 Israeli lobbying entities, including the Transatlantic Institute, the Brussels-based EU office of the American Jewish Committee, have been increasingly active in luring more than 200 high-ranking EU figures and lawmakers to unconditionally support Israel in exchange for luxurious trips to Tel Aviv and al-Quds and other in kind benefits.”\nhttps://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/01/15/740939/Italian-TV-show-exposes-how-Israeli-lobby-manipulates-EU-institutions\nOf equally interesting and ominous note is the news that Aoun has invited the head judge of the ICJ to be the new Lebanese PM. The ICJ … deliberating the Genocide will need a new Chief Judge…. Well you know what follows…\nThat is interesting, perhaps the lebanese was bribed to step down from ICJ by the west and being offered to become the PM instead?\nRegardless, what a stupid move by the lebanese – under his helm ICJ were likely to judge according to what South Africa claimed – that Israel commit genocide – because look who is likely to become his successor:\n“First African female ICJ judge Julia Sebutinde, who rejected South Africa’s genocide claims, poised for presidency”.\nhttps://www.israelhayom.com/2025/01/14/dramatic-shift-at-icc-as-pro-israel-judge-poised-for-presidency/\nThere seems to be no end in of the shadowy machinations by Israel/US and the clueless arab leaders take the bait every single time.\nCould be part of the “deal”, if “deal” there is to be.\nOf which I am somewhat sceptical, because it would be an enormous case of an incoming government leader – Trump – making what seemed to be quite a wild promise, backed by a huge threat, and with a very short time-scale, and then actually keeping it. There aren’t many examples of that happening in the history of the world.\nCould perhaps also be part of bigger deal where Trump/Israel is going to focus on Iran. By pacificing Hamas, through the ceasefire, they cut off a possible second front if Israel/US plan to attack Iran.\n@Jack – Yes, it could be that. How do Trump’s business interests and those of his appointees and their owners (Kushners, Adelman, Witkoff, Rubio’s owner Braman, Waltz, Stefanik, Huckabee) align with the plan of shifting the genocide to Iran?\nA genocidal assault on the West Bank would probably be part of the same plan. That NATO office in Jordan scares me a lot.\nSee what they say here:\nhttps://forward.com/news/674101/trump-cabinet-israel-rubio-huckabee-jewish/\n“In 2017, (Mike Huckabee) said, ‘There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria. There’s no such thing as a settlement.’”\nExpression of hatred against the UN could be an indicator.\nAll happening just in time for Inauguration Day for the West’s New Commander in Chief.\nLooks good on his CV no doubt temporarily, but just like Biden’s Regime it’s a cynical manoeuvre.\n42 days is a long time in politics so we’ll see how the other madmen Smodrich and Givir take the bad news.\nThey could possibly bring Netanyahu’s coalition down.\nUnless Trump has done a deal with them?\nThen – what/whom replaces it?\nSame tune – different piano?\nI just hope that food and water can get in just for temporary relief.\nThe Hostages have a home and family to go to.\nWhere do the Gazans go?\nOne for Jeremy Bowen and the staff at the Guardian that.\nThey represent the Liberal Democracies.\nIt will stop them having to lie for 42 days maybe?\nA relief for them no doubt – bit of a rest from lying all day.\nI’ll give it less than 42 hours …\nOnce Trumps coronation is out the way, all hell will be released, again.\nIt would be high risk for Israel to abandon the ceasefire after phase 1. Trump has attached his name to this deal. Can the Israelis afford to defy and humiliate a man as unpredictable, thin-skinned and petulant as Trump, especially as he is no longer seeking Jewish money? He could turn on them, cut arms and, critically, turn most of the American right and Republicans against Israel. That’s a risk that would pose a genuine existential threat for Israel.\nIf there is ceasefire violations it will be framed that Hamas breached it so it is risk free for Israel to initiate hostilities. Just watch how the lebanese “ceasefire” played out.\nAnd after all Trump is 100% zionist just like the rest of his incoming administration.\nThe Israelis are incapable of going 42 days without killing a Palestinian. Any ceasefire will not hold, I’d put money on that, and let’s not forget this is a ceasefire not a cessation of hostilities. Gaza has been destroyed, it is not going to be allowed to rebuild.\nIt will indeed be interesting to see how Trump can get out of this mess.\nI wouldn’t be at all surprised if Netanyahu leaves office in the next six weeks, nor if he gets painted in Zionist history as some kinda conciliationist race traitor.\nThe real capital of Israel is in any case New York.\nAs Craig said, the evil BBC cost Scotland her Independence (London Calling – YouTube)\nAnd as Noam Chomsky told Andrew Marr, he wouldn’t be sitting where he’s sitting if he spoke the truth….\nI have been oustide BBC Glasgow protesting Three times,\nBut now Mark Curtis tells more truths about the evil BBC:\n‘National scandal’: The BBC’s Gaza cover-up\nhttps://www.declassifieduk.org/national-scandal-the-bbcs-gaza-cover-up/?\nTony Greenstein posted a great piece on his blog earlier:\n‟Led By the Jewish Bloc We Will Be Marching on Saturday March 18 to the BBC Whatever the Institutionally Racist Metropolitan Police Say\nAs we celebrate the ceasefire in Gaza, a ceasefire that despite his claims, Genocide Joe Biden has nothing to do with, we see the Metropolitan Police giving a veto to the Genocidal ‘Chief Rabbi’ Mirvis, a settler-trained rabbi who is an out and out racist, having participated in the ‘Death to the Arabs’ flag marches in Jerusalem.\nThe Police’s decision to try to ban Saturday’s march against Genocide in Gaza because the ‘proposed route would have caused serious disruption to a central London synagogue’ is a lie. Lying comes as easily to the Met as a duck to water.\nLaughably the Met also said ‘our role is not to take sides’. The fact that the Met have raised disruption to a synagogue, that is not even on the route, as a pretext to prevent a demonstration proves that they have taken sides. The side of the supporters of Genocide in Gaza.”\nhttps://azvsas.blogspot.com/2025/01/led-by-jewish-bloc-we-will-be-marching.html\nIn a statement on X/twitter reproduced in the article the Met Police actually tell a massive great big porkie in respect of the original march saying that ‘Their proposed route would have caused serious disruption to a central London synagogue’. This of course gives the impression that the march would have passed by the synagogue, or close to it. But the route of the march didn’t go anywhere near the synagogue, and the nearest the marchers would have been to it is the BBC HQ where they were to assemble and demonstrate against BBC bias re Gaza before setting off on the march. And BBC HQ is 500m away from the synagogue.\nAs per usual with the zionist fascist scum, it’s just one fucking lie after another after another… just one lie on top of another on top of another. Just about everything they do is built on deceit, as with the founding of Israel itself. But then so do the likes of Starmer and Lammy and Biden and Blinken etc., etc., etc., who all have the blood of millions on their hands. Yep, the planet is run and controlled by the most evil people on it, who have been creating our fucked-up reality for thousands of years. The goddam psychopaths, that is.\nTrump’s security advisor recently said that Israel/Saudi normalization deal is a top priority for the region. The focus seems to be to get rid of Hamas political power in Gaza and install a pro-israel saudi/sunni regime:\n“Gaza War Is Over, an Impediment to Trump’s Truly Lucrative Prize: Israeli-Saudi Normalization”\n“..incoming U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Dan Senor’s podcast. He called Saudi-Israeli normalization “a huge priority,”\n–\n“…the hope is that Hamas, in the name of Arab unity, will relinquish control in Gaza and will claim to have given the reins to a “unity government.”\n–\n“This government is expected to made up of puppets acceptable to the West, some constellation or another with the Palestinian Authority and great influence by Saudi, Qatari and UAE funds. A resolution to the situation in Gaza will pave the way to peace with Saudi Arabia”.\nhttps://archive.is/Xr86T#selection-1442.0-1442.1\nThe saudis already showing their true colors:\n“Saudi-Led Talks on Syria’s Future Exclude Iran and Russia”\nhttps://iranwire.com/en/politics/138107-saudi-led-talks-on-syrias-future-exclude-iran-and-russia/\n“Saudi Arabia says it executed six Iranians for drug trafficking”\nhttps://www.iranintl.com/en/202501019912\nAccording to Asa Winstanley the agreement with Hamas, which has been accepted by them, is the same one they accepted in May, and constitutes defeat for Israel if it actually goes through.\nThis is a very dangerous time….\nhttps://www.asawinstanley.com/\nAsa Winstanley’s journalism newsletter about October 7th shows through its photographs that most of the deaths of Israelis came from plasma flame throwing helicopter gunships or tanks. The flamethrowers are indeed formidable leaving just charcoal statues. The Hamas attack was on the IDF military position 4 miles from the border, which is where most of the hostages were taken from\nAnd the itv headline reads that hours after the ceasefire came into effect Israel has carried out deadly air strikes. Nothing is as it seems. Is Trump complicit or just being ignored? Is this still under Biden’s watch because the handover hasn’t happened yet?\nDoesn’t come into effect until Sunday the19th. Hasn’t been ratified by isreal yet. Plenty of time to kill lots more Palestinians.\nAlyson\nYes, they – the presenter – were saying THAT on the news last night (on the BBC News channel) – ie saying it to different people they were interviewing (and getting their response). And saying that it’s a big talking point amongst Israelis. And there was one guy he interviewed, a spokesperson for Israel, who was undoubtedly British – who was saying at one point that the agreement isn’t finalised yet because there are things that Hamas haven’t agreed to yet. And the presenter then said ‘Are you saying that whoever (I can’t remember who it was that made the announcement) was wrong to announce that an agreement has been reached and agreed upon?’, to which the guy mumbled something or other. And then the penny dropped that the lying, conniving Israelis want for people to think and believe that Hamas are prevaricating and making demands about this and that and holding things up. And obviously did so because THAT is what the Israelis have done before – ie blamed Hamas – and the idea of course was to reinforce that in peoples’ minds (by saying what he said).\nIt’s convoluted, but I’m sure you know what I mean.\nMany independent observers currently make the same conjecture: if Netanyahu finally agrees today to a ceasefire he’s been rejecting for over a year, it’s probably not as an inauguration present for Trump and a farewell humiliation for Biden.\nThere’s got to be a deal. And presumably “an offer he just can’t refuse”. What can be Netanyahu‘s final goal before he surrenders his position as a PM, what achievement would keep him from harm’s way in the Israeli public opinion?\nThe answer is obvious: ELIMINATE THE IRANIAN THREAT. This done, no more axis of resistance, the way towards Greater Israel is wide open, and Netanyahu no longer a renegade but a national hero. So Trump must have said: “Just do it, but on your own”.\nTrump main objective is to tell Americans “ I don’t fight wars “, but he doesn’t object to others doing so. He doesn’t care if Israel brings Iran back to the stone age, or if his buddy Putin swallows half of Ukraine and another few neighboring countries. It’s good for business at the end of the day.\nAnd co-president Elon is enthusiastic. He can make the EU collapse like a failed souffle cake, reduce Britain to a 52nd state, and impose Starlink and X as the only global channels of influence.\nWhat could go wrong?\nIncidentally, as a hideaway from British law enforcement, Tehran is probably even better than Beirut. So, should Craig Murray decide to relocate in Iran, it would certainly be a wise move, both for security and reporting convenience…\nCan someone clarify this point ?\nGiven that UNRWA have the mandate to provide relief to the Palestinian Refugees ( from 1948- till the present). Does the Gaza ceasefire agreement maintain UNRWA’s role in providing these relief functions to the Palestinian refugees in Gaza ?\nThanks.\n@Johnny – “Does the Gaza ceasefire agreement maintain UNRWA’s role in providing these relief functions to the Palestinian refugees in Gaza?”\nFrom what’s been published:\n“Humanitarian aid procedures under the agreement will be done subject to the humanitarian protocol agreed upon under the supervision of the mediators.”\nThe mediators are the governments of the United States, Qatar, and Egypt.\n(That’s not a “Yes” or “No” answer, but it’s the best I could find. It seems the answer is probably “No”.)\nThanks for checking that Brian.\nOf the Palestinian prisoners whom the occupation have agreed to release, 1000 are hostages captured by occupation forces on 8 October 2023, the day after the resistance breakout operation.\n*If* the agreement is implemented, it seems at least some resistance soldiers will be allowed to Egypt for medical treatment.\nThe policy of the Egyptian government has been an absolute f***ing disgrace since the beginning of this slaughter, but if they allow resistance soldiers to receive medical treatment that is of course welcome. Hopefully they won’t want especially big bribes to allow this.\nTalking of the Egyptians, it’s catastrophic that they didn’t think to put it in the public domaine that they had warned Israel several times that Hamas were planning something big BEFORE the attack happened. Surely they must have realised after warning Israel the first time and seeing they were doing nothing to counter or prevent an attack, and then warning them a second time precisely because they weren’t, that Netanyahu and Co wanted the attack to happen – ie wanted it to happen so that he/they could justify bombing Gaza and its inhabitants back into the stone age, and killing and maiming hundreds of thousands of them.\nHow weird! I just went to close a tab that I could see (in the tab) was a search I did at some point recently, and just quickly opened it to check what the search was in relation to before deleting it, and Shami Chakrabarti sort of sprung out at me for a split second as I opened it and then disappeared. But her name was no-where to be seen in the top results – ie the results that were initially visiable, so I scrolled down the page a bit, and then some more, and there it was, and the article was about her investigation and subsequent report in 2016, and there was a link to the report, so I clicked on it so as to have a quick gander. And came across the following passage:\nI am in no way suggesting that bad taste metaphors and comparisons should ever be a matter for the\ncriminal law any more than say ill-judged and incendiary cartoons. I am told that they are frequently\nused in Israel. However, they are all too capable, not only of bringing the Labour Party into disrepute,\nbut of actively undermining the cause of peace, justice and statehood for the Palestinian people which\nforms part of Labour’s current “two-state” foreign policy and which so many Jewish people (including\nin the Labour Party) actively support.\nI make no comment on past, present or future foreign policy in this report. Such discussion is well\nbeyond my remit. Suffice to say that insensitive and incendiary language, metaphor and comparison is\nof no help to constructive debate, in general, and discourse around the future of Israel-Palestine, in\nparticular.\n– I recommend that Labour members resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors,\ndistortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular.\n_________________\nI wonder if she’s now changed her mind?!\nAnd as for the cause of peace, justice and statehood for the Palestinian people which forms part of Labour’s current “two-state” foreign policy…..

  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2013_02_voice-of-russia-interview/content_6.html": "Exclusive interview with Craig Murray\n|\n|\n21.02.2013, 19:52\n|\n|\nCraig Murray may be Britain’s most controversial former Ambassador. He was dismissed from his post in Uzbekistan in 2004 amid lurid allegations about his personal life, and medically evacuated from there after becoming dangerously ill. He concludes he was poisoned and suspects CIA involvement.\nA senior diplomat for twenty years, Craig Murray is now a political activist and a blogger.He maintains his claim that the war in Iraq was based on false allegations about the existence of weapons of mass destruction.\nSource: Voice of Russia.\n|\nIf you can, listen to this rather than read the transcript. The transcript is a precis and contains a few mistakes – notably legal for illegal more than once, But mostly because I have noted before my spoken English does not transcribe well, relying heavily on inflexion.\nI think there is a little bit of censorship with one sentence taken out, where I said the last ten years Russia has gone backwards in democratic development, but overall in a longer historic perspective it is possible to argue Russia is making progress. The second part of that is still in and sits rather strangely. The edit comes at 5.56 in the soundtrack and is pretty obvious and clunky when you know.\nThe Cyrillic is pronounced something like Chitat dalieh – read further\nExcellent Craig. I listened as I read the transcript and can see the few blips but passable. Mr Eccott is a good interviewer and comes over in a relaxed way which must assist the process.\nCopy of the recording to Messrs Blair and Straw? And to all the others on the list too. Bastards. I don’t know how you have withstood their slime. You have retained your humanity. Theirs, that is if it ever existed, went years ago.\nQuite an interesting interview you had Mr Murray.\nBritain’s (and Europe’s) relations with Russia have not actually changed since Victorian times. Britain is still Russia’s (or more accurately Russian oligarchy’s) favourite place to invest the capital obtained by selling primarily raw materials. Russia is still a market for European goods and is still viewed as a security threat by European nations. Russia still views Britain as a threat to its European affairs.\nTone of the interview is particularly interesting. I have a feeling of that VoR slightly abused your critic of British establishment status and questioned you on the matters that were relevant to their particular ideological direction. For instance they were quick to spot signs of corruption in western system but had no questions on corruption in Russia which in views (and experience) of many is much more prevalent than in Europe. And as you admitted yourself they have cut out the only sentence where you criticised current Russian establishment.\nNot sure about you but to me it seems this interview was much worse in terms of its objectivity than any interview that you would give to British media. With the only exception that you were actually allowed to criticise British (and western in general) establishment.\nGood interview Craig Murray executed with your usual panache and good common-sense. I just left the following message:\n“The cancelled Gibson Inquiry was an admission that the UK was up to its midriff in torture, even if this torture was done by proxy. The only conclusion the Gibson Inquiry could have reached was that the UK was complicit in rendition and torture at the behest of the CIA. Jack Straw should have been prosecuted for signing off the rendition agreements, and prosecuted alongside Tony Blair for misleading the British public by embarking on an illegal war on Iraq. The Tories had to back down over Gibson because they were already involved in rendering similar ‘favours’ to our masters across the Atlantic, including the extradition of Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan to US Supermax torture-chambers with the grave intent of getting Julian Assange there too via Sweden following another CIA-engineered ‘Kompromat’.”\nAnd also it is hard to spot any Russian progress even in longer historical prospective.\nRussia along with China are the last remaining empires. Russia in particular has over 70% of its territory and around 40% of its population subjected to Moscow’s rule. In some cases this subjection is forcible in other it is based on long and persistent adjustment of history and culture of subjected people in favour of Moscow’s ideology. There are many so called ‘smaller people’ (the term was introduced by Czarist social scientists and itself displays chauvinistic attitude of Russians towards others subjected to them) who were ripped of their cultural heritage and were made to believe that their survival depends on their attachment to Russia.\nThis Russia has nothing positive in even longer term historical prospective.\nGood interview, but don’t underestimate the co-operation between British and Russian elites at various times since Tsar Peter I.\nThat said, there has also been a lot of psychological projection involved in British attitudes towards Russia – ‘Russia’s obsessed with security‘, ‘Russia has imperial ambitions‘, ‘the KGB is everywhere‘, etc. Which is not to say that all of these weren’t true! At least these perceptions weren’t as schizoid as post-WW2 perceptions of France, where ‘the French always put their own interests first‘ compensates for British elite jealousy about their French counterparts’ apparently lesser degree of subjugation to the US yoke! 🙂\nWas British protection of Boris Berezovsky too hot (or should that be too radioactive?) a subject for Голос России to handle?\n“The transcript is a precis and contains a few mistakes – notably legal for illegal more than once, But mostly because I have noted before my spoken English does not transcribe well, trlying heavily on onflexion.”\nYour type-written English is also bloody awful. Craig, can’t you type your posts up in a wordprocessor or email client with spell checker?\nJemand, yes but just that one sentence and the word ‘clunkky’. Not bad if you’re busy.\nThis is just one speck of what Craig was talking about.\nThe Massacre of Al-Amiriyah Remembered\nIbrahim Ebeid\nFebruary 20, 2013\nWhile the People of the United States were celebrating Valentine’s Day, February 1991, the day of Love and Friendship, US bombs were falling all over Iraq. Destruction and death were the lot of Iraq and its People.\nAl-Amiriya, a bomb shelter which was one of 38 shelters built by a Scandinavian construction company was brutally attacked by US Air Force. Fifteen hundred civilians, mostly women and children, were taking refuge in it when the precision bombs fell and turned the refuge into a death chamber. Only 11 were known to have survived after suffering different degrees of wounds, burns and psychological trauma. Whole families were wiped out, as can still be seen today from their locked houses in Amiriyah.\nThe temperature inside the shelter rose to thousands of degrees melting bodies along with cement and iron. The evidence is still there in the blackened ceiling where melted iron rods in the roof hang inside along the edges of the hole, which was caused by the bombs. Ripped air conditioning ducts lie on the floor to bear witness to the crimes committed by George Bush Sr. and his Administration.\nThe shelters were designed for civilian use, to be located in densely populated residential areas, such as al-Amiriya in the north-west of Baghdad. The shelter consists of two floors, with the top floor used for living and sleeping and the lower floor intended for food storage, drinking water and washing water tanks, boilers, bathrooms, fuel storage, standby generators and the medical staff and their equipment.\nThe details of these shelters and their locations were known to all residents, whether Iraqis or not, all through the 1980s during the Iraq-Iran war. There were neither secret establishments nor restricted access to any body; the shelter was not a military bunker as the criminals pretend.\nFew days before the slaughter of the civilians took place the Baby Milk Factory was destroyed to deprive the children of Iraq of the most essential nourishment. The intention was to starve, maim and kill the children of Iraq or deprive them from a healthy future.\nVideo and photo.\nhttp://www.uruknet.info?p=95406 Ibrahim Ebeid\n~~~\nCould we have please have less of the nit picking here – spelling, typos etc\nCould we please have less of the nit picking here – spelling, typos etc !!\nHypothetically speaking and directly related to this, another excellent interview, would you say it appropriate to keep names ‘a secret’, of those who have committed abuse and crimes against others.\nI mean, real crimes like defrauding the taxpayer, paedophilia, corruption at the highest level, or such.\nFor example, should one find out that our elusive Adam Werritty, most likely of new face and papers, was actually out to defraud us all and sell some arms here there and everywhere fronting himself as MOD insider, would that be a secret to keep?\nIf you would be asked to keep these ‘indiscretions’ we call crimes a secret because it might be/it is vitally necessary to protect the establishment or even Royalty, would you deem this to fall into your slot of acceptable secrets?\nWhat is an acceptable secret?, bar the launch codes and coordinates of the Force de Frappe/Trident? Why is it not acceptable to say were these weapons are pointing, mainly? they are aggressor and retaliation weapon system we keep for old times sake, expensive, vulnerable in peace times, and useless in current wars.\nWe know that the first strike plans for hitting Chinese underground nuclear arms bunkers are a secret, but the intention has been publicised in an attempt to make war a normal every day occurrence, world war 2 gets rewarmed thrice/week in an PR attempt to soften us up to the normality of killing civilians, on a daily basis, here there and everywhere, torture talk and funny video’s of people ‘trying’ water boarding, all part and parcel.\nNever an issue at election time.\nSo you said in the video that there are some secrets that should be kept, so, what would you regard worth keeping a secret?

Cameron, in this case.\nChapter and verse from CAAT.\nCameron’s Indian odyssey – brickbats and cricket bats, fighter jets and on-message execs\nBy Kaye Stearman, 22nd February 2013\nTopics: BAE, Cobham, India, Rolls Royce\nDavid Cameron has just returned from yet another overseas trade mission – this time to India.\nIt’s been billed as the largest UK trade mission ever, with over 100 delegates – government ministers, MPs, “leaders of industry”, university grandees and assorted hangers-on. In the name of cementing trade ties we have seen Cameron playing cricket, laying wreaths and promising quicker visas for Indian students.\nPhoto “Would you like to buy this Eurofighter Typhoon, sir?”\nAll this flummery rather disguises the main aim of the trade mission to flog arms to India, which in recent years has emerged as one of the world’s largest arms buyers. So it is worth having a closer look at who accompanied Cameron and what they might be selling.\n/…\nhttp://blog.caat.org.uk/2013/02/22/camerons-indian-odyssey-brickbats-and-cricket-bats-fighter-jets-and-on-message-execs/\nFar from wanting to bug you in a very communicative session, my question after your statement in the interview, Craig, is, what do you regard a secret worth keeping a secret?\nMary wrote – “Could we please have less of the nit picking here – spelling, typos etc !!”\nLess than one means zero. And zero “nit picking” means more lice. I stand by my comment – if it’s worth writing, it’s worth writing properly. Nobody would ever stand for “To bee or nop too bo, tht is the qstion”. Sheesh!\nVery well spoken, Craig, and completely refreshing and candid. Stay well!\n—\nJemand, you obviously haven’t listened to the interview which is a serious dialogue about pervasively important issues. And if you have listened, its surprising you don’t have your bearings to keep your pathetic little observations off so as not to detract from the Big Picture.\nOnce again, you show your utter lack of class writing stupid comments while lying on the ‘settee’ in your ‘lounge’ eating your ‘sweet’ with your ‘dentures’ on shouting at your ‘missus’ because she forgot to give you a ‘serviette’.\nAnd btw, as i’ve pointed out before, you are a commenter here, not a ‘commentator’. Do you see the difference?\nBoy, you are so Non-U.\nNow then girls !\nWell, Habby, gotta keep this place true right Bad Boy?\nCraig, there is almost a full minute of the interview that has been left out of the transcript.\nIt starts at the 11:35 mark and runs through to the 12:30 mark and fits in following this statement, “After David Cameron’s election the very first visitor to Number 10 was Rupert Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch entered not by the front door, but by the back door so that nobody would see him.”\nYou go on to describe how the Uzbek diplomat meets with George Bush in Texas and hands Uzbek’s oil to Enron.\nI’m surprised no one else has highlighted this deleted text. I have saved a copy of the audio as a backup just in case the online audio gets editted and this statement is removed.\nIt seems close to the most damning statement in the whole talk.\nHave you proof?\n“Less than one means zero. And zero “nit picking” means more lice. I stand by my comment – if it’s worth writing, it’s worth writing properly. Nobody would ever stand for “To bee or nop too bo, tht is the qstion”. Sheesh!”\nOoooh look, a spelling flame.\nGet a life.\nWhat a bunch of uptight fucking wowsers you’ve become. A sense of humour is free, go take one off the shelf and nurture it. For the record, my original post was intended to be a jocular observation that Craig’s posts are replete with spelling errors made glaringly obvious by his admission that his “spoken English does not transcribe well”. It was my first, and now last, remark about his spelling. Not to be taken seriously by anyone at all, esp. Craig. And not expecting any reply either – not even a chuckle.\nBut what a curious response I’ve enjoyed on this thread. A group of people who consistently post off topic, criss-crossing multiple conversations, discussing the most serious issues of the day mixed with banal observations about life and THEN daring to attack me for the unforgivable offence of having a light-hearted dig at Craig’s spelling. You could have graciously let it slip by, but no.\nAs for you my old friend, Villager, you have become the archetype thug around here with your high-count sniping at other COMMENTATORS in a shameless attempt to ingratiate yourself with this blog’s own establishment. You never did let that one go, did you? I do recall that we effected a kind of truce where I wouldn’t pick up on your own questionable commentary (as in, a series of comments), in particular those supporting the indefatigable Goran Rudling. You’ve done quite a turnaround since then, haven’t you? It’s also interesting to note that you are the most cowardly of commentators, sensing a quorum first before mustering the courage to fire off a salvo. At long last, you must now feel like you belong.\nThat might have been funny if it wasn’t so churlish. But then, you are a churl, with an obsession about “class”. Imagining me as some kind of Alf Garnett is probably intended to make you feel better about yourself than make me feel worse. I feel fine. Thanks to your ill-advised latest missive, the truce is now off as are the gloves. I’m going to be more active here now than ever before, you’ll be delighted to know. I look forward to your reply.\nFred said – “Ooooh look, a spelling flame. Get a life.”\nHow ironic.\n@ GregLBean – Hi, you got me wondering. Here’s the missing part transcribed:\n(Ecott’s followup question actually refers to the missing text and so the meaning is skewed in the VoR transcript, where it now seems to be referring to Murdoch and Cameron)\nAs to your question, have you proof? I have heard Craig speak of this incident before, for example in his Berlin address last year (http://youtu.be/yUZTiAoaax4?t=29m21s):\nCraig has posted supporting documents for Murder in Samarkand under the Docments tab here, but I don’t see the Enron letter. But the text is here: http://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2005/12/more_old_news_1/\nI’m guessing it’s that bit about Gazprom of Russia being in on the Uzbek-Enron deal that made Voice of Russia delete that part from the transcript. Other stories I read online while searching for the letter mention Enron’s Lay pushing Romania to Bush too. Anyway, I’d say yes, Craig has proof and has published it.\nWhether that proof continues to be available online is another question. Searching Craig’s site, I come across a few instances where he links to a picture of it, but all the links I tried are dead now. Scrubbed? That sucks.\n@ Me In Us, wow, great research/background, I’ll read up a bit further. I wonder if any of the WikiLeaks Diplomatic Cables or Stratfor Global Intelligence files would shed any further light on this.\nI’ve read that Putin’s wealth is a result of him getting a percentage on all of the Gas sold by Russia, likely a small slice but in the end worth big $$$$ (rubles). Some reports say he’s worth $500 billion.\nI find it intriguing that we have never seen leaks on financials. Torture, war crimes, genocide, all can be leaked but anyone who goes anywhere near leaking financial info is immediately silenced. Remember the vanishing (BofA?) financials Wikileaks threatened to leak. And what ever happened to Rudolph Elmer’s info?\nIf financial info ever gets out it will change the power structure in the World instantly. And let’s be real, if Governments (US, UK, EU, BRIC) were really interested in exposing it they could do so in a heartbeat.\nBut then it is the same guys who are hiding the financial corruption who own these Governments so not likely to happen any time soon… unless there are leaks.\nIt’s pure speculation but one has to wonder if the real reason for the over zealous pursuit of Assange has to do with what he has but hasn’t yet released; did the (BofA?) Financials really get destroyed by Domscheit-Berg, where the Elmer CD’s really blank?\nHi Greg, no clue! I never heard of Elmer, and as for BofA — oh yeah, I forgot about that! Thanks for the update.\nThe thing about the pipeline… you know, if someone doesn’t connect the dots for me I come up with all kinds of crazy constructs. After I posted, I was thinking more. Like, didn’t Greg Palast, while Bush was in office, have a big story about the proposed pipeline … map drawn and rights divvied before the invasion of Afghanistan and the Iraq war … one oil company screwing another one out of its rights? I can’t find Palast’s story now, and maybe I’m misremembering, but Wikipedia has an entry on the pipeline, known as TAPI, pretty much as Craig described it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Afghanistan_Pipeline. Wikipedia says it was Unocal/Saudi cutting out Bridas of Argentina, before the 1997 meeting Craig spoke about with Poppy Bush on the board of Unocal. But the thing I don’t get is, the purpose of the pipeline is to avoid both Iran and Russia. So why would Gazprom of Russia be in cahoots with Enron? Answer may be in Murder in Samarkand, I don’t know.\nMore than I can grasp —\nHas this bit — but Enron’s letter to Texas Gov GWB was addressed to Austin? — and Escobar makes no mention of Enron in his long article.\nAnd as you admitted yourself they have cut out the only sentence where you criticised current Russian establishment.\nWhat was the criticism? I have written for the Russia media a few times, and the only time I was ever edited was when one sentence might have been potentially libelous against a particular private person. None of my criticisms re-Russia in general were edited.\nThat is, did you say precisely, “the last ten years Russia has gone backwards in democratic development, but overall in a longer historic perspective it is possible to argue Russia is making progress.” Sounds like a weird thing to take out given its extremely anodyne and general nature.",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2018_09_importing-jihadi-terror-to-the-uk-cui-bono/content_20.html": "If Osama Bin Laden was not sufficient warning that decades of money, arms and other support from the Western security services does not render a jihadi a friend of the West, then the Manchester bomber, Salman Abedi, should have opened British eyes forever to the danger. In collaboration with MI5, Abedi had been fighting in the ongoing proxy war for Western oil interests in Libya, before being rescued by the Royal Navy. Back home in Manchester, he carried out an attack of appalling violence against a primarily young and female target group.\nSo it would be very foolish indeed to rely on the fact that the jihadi logistic support and propaganda group the White Helmets is largely British government funded, to expect its members who are now, like Abedi, being brought into the UK, to behave as quiet citizens. The links of the White Helmets to Al-Nusra and Al-Shams and other jihadi groups are deep – they chose to be evacuated to Idlib together from numerous sites. The reason there is no substantial corpus of independently filmed evidence of the White Helmets’ work is that they co-operate with people who would chop off western journalists’ heads on sight. In many well-attested cases, they are the same people.\nIn ending all funding to the White Helmets, the Dutch government did not wish to be confrontational towards the other neo-conservative governments who are funding and exploiting the propaganda from the White Helmets. Their report was therefore diplomatically phrased. Funding for the White Helmets may have “inadvertently” fallen into the hands of armed extremists, while unacceptable contact between the White Helmets and extreme jihadists was “inevitable” in the areas they operated.\nThanks to social media, there is an awareness among the UK’s general population of who the White Helmets really are, that belies the solidarity of the entire political and media class in maintaining the official fiction. Even the arch government supporting Daily Telegraph in reporting the story of White Helmets’ admittance to the UK, has a majority of readers’ comments pointing out the true nature of the White Helmets. (Being a Tory paper, there are naturally other comments which are simply Islamophobic).\nWhich is of course the irony of this. Entirely innocent British Muslims face the day to day surveillance state harassment of the Prevent programme, where Muslim students pursuing security studies are reported to the police for reading books on terrorism, and school pupils are reported for expressing opposition to the mass bombing of Libya by NATO or arms sales to Saudi Arabia. I cannot give a talk in a university about Palestine without a Prevent strategy risk assessment being formally compiled by the university authorities and approved by the police.\nYet not only has the largest terrorist attack of the last decade been committed by somebody working with MI5 and brought into the country by the Royal Navy, we are now importing jihadis with no prior connection to the UK other than receipt of British government funding.\nBritain has never had larger or better-funded security services. As a major economic interest in its own right, the “security industry” has grown into a major component of the military industrial complex. Just as the arms industry requires external enemies, the security industry requires internal enemies. It is notable that many of the “foiled” terrorist plots of the last decade involved prior MI5 contact, sometimes bordering on agent provocateur operations. “Prevent” produces enemies who are not actually enemies at all.\nNobody has consciously decided to import the White Helmets to maintain the internal terrorist threat in the UK. But institutions, on analysis over time, almost always promote their institutional interest. Increasing the terrorist threat in the UK undeniably serves the economic self-interest of the security industry. Just as the promotion of war and internal tension has always benefited the arms industry and the rest of the military industrial complex. Importing the White Helmets into the UK is obviously nuts if your purpose is to minimise jihadi activity in the UK. So we have to ask, is that really the purpose?\n“Nobody has consciously decided to import the White Helmets to maintain the internal terrorist threat in the UK.” How do you know this?\nI randomly clicked one of CM’s many “embedded” links, intended to lend scholarly heft to his latest fusillade.\nThe Telegraph’s blustering piece about funding increases was the usual blend of fact and fiction by definition de rigeur when discussing the secret services, a clue being in this appellation. I was amused to be reminded of the sometime deputy Prime Minister, and entertainer of the troops, John Prescott.\nPrescott’s final coup de grâce was, for me, his misplaced holier-than-thou attack on some parliamentarian about an advertisement for Thai brides. I can’t remember the detail but his vicious invective had the pure comedy value of an own-goal of an unloved home team, when it was pointed out to the daft old porker that the AdSense™ offering was in fact a tailored response to his own Googling habits.\nIn Craig’s otherwise bland and trite Telegraph “citation”, I noticed a banner suggestion for RFID wallets, as may you. A marginal but telling indicator of the tin foil more generally extant in all this “dark matter”.\nLess funny than Prescott (and RFID wallets are not among my Googling priorities, I should quickly point out), but it provided some mild entertainment to be reminded of the now properly retired old fraud.",

This thread has been opened to replace it.\nAllowed HTML - you can use:\n<a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <s> <strike> <strong>\nIn Doussard there is a landing field used by many paragliders, usually after they’ve taken off from the nearby Col de la Forclaz.\nDo we know, is this where LMC claimed he landed, after his gliding event?\nApart from Col de la Forglaz (In Switzerland?) being quite a distance from Doussard (Are you thinking a powered paraglider?) I don’t think he could carry the motor and the parachute up the mountain and also on a motorcycle? I always assumed it was an un-powered one, which is basically a glorified parachute.\nAnyway, apart from that do you think paragliders “land” at airfields. That was not not my assumption or indeed experience, limited though it is.\ni) They don’t need an airfield, they barely need a field to land.\nII) Paragliders could interfere with regular flight operations. They fly at low altitudes, often below the radar, which could lead to collisions if not properly coordinated. The presence of paragliders could disrupt the normal flow of aircraft, especially during takeoff and landing phases where visibility and predictability are crucial\nIII) They would need to be in radio contact with an airfield, for them to coordinate /permit them to land\nIn short I do not think paragliders are compatible with air fields and anyway not at all necessary.\nQuote\n“Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.”\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding\nintp1\nI had not known, that, that take off place, was in Switzerland.\nProbably more local flights, also land in Doussard.\nI have never been Paragliding or hangliding.\nHowever, I was in the Air Training Corps in the sixties and became a glider pilot.\nNo roof, no engine, no communication system and no parachute, yet they let schoolchildren take part?\nI bet it would not happen, these days.\nI have not been gliding, since then, so know next to nothing.\nI would like to do it again\nI expect it would be quite expensive, these days.\nIn the ATC it was all free, they were hoping you would join the RAF, like W.B.M.\nYes so a paraglider does not have the wing span like a glider. Imagine getting towed to around 5000 ft in a glider, you would immediately be concerned where you might land? Unless you have serious thermals.\nWell then imagine you are falling from that kind of alt. in a large parachute (paraglider)? You would like to know where you might land before you jumped off the side of the mountain. Really anywhere without trees or shear rocks would do.\nSure in perfect conditions from maximum altitude with thermals to hop you could put together a long, record glide down but then put that paraglider into the situation you are thinking about.\nLittle choice of take-off point or timing, or weather conditions, stress, need for covert landing and extraction. A player in such an enterprise is not going to land at an air field where that would be probably documented. Getting across the border could be useful?\nIf there was a convenient take off point nearby, the point would be to get out without using the road, land soon and near a discrete extraction option?\nIMHO\nNow what just came into my head? The Motorcycle which was seen cross country going where there was no easy access or exit? Travelling to a jump off point? No need for riding out. Could glide down to access to a vehicle. Just a thought. That would leave an abandoned MC but Keystone Clouseau probably didnt check.\nHappy New Year!\n@michael norton & intp1\nMy recollection is that LMC actually won (possibly in a customer lottery) a ‘first flight’ introductory lesson in hang gliding (in french ‘deltaplane’). He already had decent paragliding experience.\nMany years ago I found out that the hang gliding lessons were run by ‘the Flyeo shop’ (I can’t remember whether that is the correct spelling). Anyway, they had premises in Doussard, so not co-located with the paragliding landing area. Their website noted clearly that hang gliding lessons started and ended at their premises in Doussard. Hope that helps.\nHappy New Year!\nP.S. There is another designated ‘landing field’ in the area very near Sythenex.\nVery Local\n@michael norton\nFrom your estimate of walk-in time it seems clear that, unless there was ‘inside information’ acquired by a walk-in killer, he could not be specifically targeting anybody killed that day.\nHowever a walk-in theory would work well for a ‘local lunatic’ scenario but they would implicitly be very local.\nHere is Flyeo in Bing Maps\nhttps://www.bing.com/maps?cp=45.777891%7E6.225231&lvl=16.9&style=h\nClicking on the icon brings up no result, so they may no longer be trading.\nAlso the landing ground near Sythenex does not seem to appear any more.\nEspace 3D Parapente\nRoute de Marceau\nLathuile.\nThis place is incredibly close to the Lathuile home of W.B.M. it is also on a road to Chevaline\nDoes anybody remember from the early days a MC coming down through Chevaline and possibly being seen by the builders and/or seen by WBM just before he reached the eglise in Chevaline? I seem to remember that it was mentioned in one of the early TV docos (possibly Panorama).\nDoes anyone know the the original source?\nThis sighting, if real, could be important because, given what we have recently found out, it probably was not LMC. So it could have been a random rider who had been up the combe and was just leaving or it could have been a rider who had given a pillion passenger a lift up the combe as michael norton has suggested.\nGrotte de Seythenex\nSo, I am trying to check out key timings as I try to rebuild a ‘clean’ version of the timeline.\n“Around 1pm the family left the campsite and drove towards the village of Chevaline”\nAnd my timeline has the Al Hilli family in Chevaline/Arnand from approx 15:10. However it should not have taken them very long to drive directly there from their campsite.\nSo, where did they go?\nOne hint is that we were told that they did some souvenir shopping.\nAnother, more tenuous indication is that they went to the Grotte de Seythenex at some time in their stay (but we don’t know when).\nIf they actually went to the Grotte then their route that day would be very different than we have been led to believe. They could have been ‘followed’ in the loosest sense of the word and targeted as tourists.\nQuote from https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11021831/Orphaned-Brit-girl-parents-shot-Alps-tells-reveals-details-killer.html\nWell if it was me they might have gone for Lunch although it is the law in France that you all must have lunch between 12- 1300.\nPicnic?\n@intp1\nYes, that is a very good suggestion.\nWhether they went to a souvenir shop, a restaurant or Le Grotte, or even all three, there would be opportunities to interact with possible miscreants. Robbery-gone-wrong may not seem like a likely scenario but we are already deep in outlier country.\nMaybe SM just rocked up and recognised the killer, thus precipitating the carnage\nOne very strange point about this slaughter.\nNobody has been caught.\nAlmost every other mass slaughter event, the perps are caught, usually within days.\nMeaning they are caught, if they do not take their own lives or the police don’t kill them first.\nThe French Authorities, know the exact place and time this happened.\nThey have the dead bodies of those killed.\nThey know the movements of those killed, leading up to the moment.\nThey know the connections of victims to each other and of their connections to many other people.\nThey have DNA evidence.\nThey have statements from the two survivors.\nThey have statements from LMC.\nThey have statements from W.B.M.\nThey have statements from Zaid al-Hilli.\nThey have statements from Patrice Menegaldo.\nThey have statements from Nordahl Lelandais.\nThey have statements from Eric Devouassoux.\nThey have the spent slugs.\nThey have fragments of the gun grips.\nThey have the spent shell cases.\nThey have the cycle of Sylvain.\nThey have the car of Mr.al-Hilli.\nThey have the caravan of the al-Hilli family.\nThey have the al-Hilli camera.\nYet they apparently do not have a clue, who the killer or killers could be.\nThey also apparently do not have a motive.\nStrange.\n@Strange\nIt points to very efficient extraction or the French do not want and will not allow the truth to come out. Or Both.\nSuggested Reasons:\n* Politically very embarrassing for the French or their allies\n* Technically embarrassing; such a huge cock up (by the French or its allies) that there would be public outrage\n* A possibility I have hypothesised is a clash of 2 or more services unwittingly stumbling into each other which would be all of above.\n* It is possible that it is classified for good reasons of national security; i.e. if we knew, we could agree it should be secret\nIt has security services involvement written all over it:\nWBM looks and quacks like an agent\nThe immediate appearance of senior British embassy officials, in numbers at the scene by early the following morning.\nThe intense activity of French (and British) police and investigators to this day who’s responsibility seems to be to produce nothing.\nSylvain Mollier looks and quacks like an agent.\nMrs. al-Hilli was also an agent.\nThe “mother” of Mrs. al-Hilli, was also an agent.\nSwiss cheese.\nThere are more holes in this article than in Swiss cheese.\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14363159/2012-massacre-Brit-family-Alps-Swiss-soldier.html\nSee how many holes you can find. For example:-\n”Investigators believe there is also evidence to suggest the killings were at random rather than pre-conceived.\nThe Al-Hillis were on holiday and simply exploring the countryside, while experienced cyclist Mr Mollier is said to have taken this route for the first time when the tragedy occurred.”\nWell, we know from Mollier’s uncle, who lived in Faverges, that he did in fact regularly grimp this very route and would often drop in for a visit on the way back to Ugine.\nTir fichant\nQuote from The Telegraph – link here:- https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/02/05/alps-shooter-former-swiss-special-forces-lost-the-plot/\n“Trapped in their BMW parked in the forest car park, three members of the Al-Hilli family were shot with three or four bullets each.\nAll received one or two bullets to the head at close range.\nAccording to the weapons expert, the killer used a “tir fichant” (precision close-range) technique that bears the hallmarks of a “very specific military training” known only to a handful of individuals for use in “extreme situations”.\nThese include members of the French external intelligence agency, DGSE, a specialised service of the DGSI (internal intelligence) and the first marine infantry paratrooper regiment (RPIMa).\nLe Parisien reports, however, that investigators believe it is more likely the killer came from Switzerland, where all special military forces are trained in the exercise of such point-blank techniques, notably members of the anti-terror unit Dard (Swift action and deterrent detachment).\nIn addition, the weapons expert told Le Parisien that two private Swiss companies taught this technique in the early 2010s as part of internships open to a few military and civilians. One of these companies even offered a module called “assassin course”.\n“This is something learnt in Switzerland, not in France, or the guy is part of a specialised (French) unit,” concluded the expert.”\nLet’s say that again! “These include members of the French external intelligence agency, DGSE, a specialised service of the DGSI (internal intelligence) and the first marine infantry paratrooper regiment (RPIMa).”\nBut the gendarmes think it more likely the killer came from Switzerland. To paraphrase Christine Keeler – They would say that wouldn’t they!\nSo how does a Swiss special forces geezer gain the local knowledge to enter and exit la combe without being noticed?\nVery interesting indeed.

For example, see the pattern of shots here:\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/01/03/JS117040429_bulletholes-m62-large_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqE__X03lsIrzKCFx5DY_5f1aLqpGloEt6kAXeHA2n_uk.jpg\nand the entire article:\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/01/03/JS117040429_bulletholes-m62-large_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqE__X03lsIrzKCFx5DY_5f1aLqpGloEt6kAXeHA2n_uk.jpg\nIn my opinion, neither a regular French cop (who gets to shoot at most twenty rounds or so annually) nor a soldier (who is taught to aim at his enemies’ centre-mass first, and who, unless he is trained as a sniper, has no idea how car windows are going to deflect his shots) would have gone about this in that particular way.”\nPeter made a very good point with respect to the placement of the shots.\nCheck out the following link:-\nhttps://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/france-5-shot-4-dead-in-french-alps-may-have-intl-ramifications-2012-2.185693/page-34#post-19268120\nIt should be noted that the ‘Danish Citizen’ mentioned has been tracked down and eliminated.\nmichael norton\nJanuary 30, 2017 at 22:54\nCould any contributor hazard a guess, why The French Authorities have not yet explicitly said,\n“No longer search for the person who resembles the E-FIT-Robot, for it is an exact likeness of the mysterious motorcyclist, who was up The Combe but who saw nothing”\nwe have dismissed the story of William Brett Martin, who claimed he saw a mysterious motorcyclist, descending The Combe\nas William Brett Martin was ascending The Combe, to discover the scene of The Slaughter of the Horses, we now think W.B.M. imagined a motorcyclist, we have come to this conclusion because the motorcyclist we have identified, who we can not introduce to the public for security reasons, has told us he saw bugger all.\nWe also now want you to stop looking for side-opening helmets because the witness who told us that story is a liar.\nThank you for believing us”\n13/02/2025\nI think the French are tying themselves in knots.\nSo, as to make it seem impossible for anyone to have witnessed the slaughter, to have heard the slaughter or to have seen anybody escaping the scene, they have done their best to distance LMC and to discredit the story of W.B.M.\nIt is almost as if they never want to find anything out?\nIf Zaid al-Hilli can be named, and photo supplied to the public, if William Brett Martin can be named, and photo supplied to the public,\nif Eric Devouoassoux can be named, and photo supplied to the public, if Patrice Menegaldo, who for seven years had a liason with the sister of Sylvain Mollier, can be named, and photo supplied to the public.\nWhy can’t the mysterious motorcyclist L.M.C. be named and his picture be put up?\nWhat are the Authorities in France hiding?\nLMC\nThere must have been something special about LMC at the time of The Slaughter of the Horses or special about the past of LMC.\nNo photograph of him has been put up.\nHe has not been named.\nApparently, we have been told that he claimed he had never owned or used a special side-opening motorcycle helmet.\nApparently, he did not come forward, even though it is said he was up that combe at about the right time, because he did not believe it had anything to do with him. We have not even been told if he has accepted that he spoke with the Forest Guards.\nThe conclusion that is drawn, is this shadow person was employed by the French State.\nmichael norton\nI would like to know why The French Authorities have not yet explicitly said why they have not withdrawn the international appeal for the X5.\nI am sure you remember that there was no X5 and the witness who told them that story was a fabulist.\nAustria again.\nOne of the media reports described the sample of DNA being tested against the Austrian database as ‘ancien’.\nThe only ‘ancien’ source of DNA from the scene I know of would be the broken pieces of the Luger grip plate.\nSo, just possibly the Luger ended up in the hands of an Austrian collector\nMore Swiss cheese, and more holes.\nSee link:-\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14363159/2012-massacre-Brit-family-Alps-Swiss-soldier.html\nSo, they think that the killer opened the car door, leaned in and fired shots.\nHow does that work?\nFrom the moment that SAH started the engine and engaged reverse the doors would be locked. The locks were only released when WBM broke the window and turned off the engine.\nSo how could the killer open the car door?\nQuote\n“Zaid remains convinced that local authorities deliberately concealed key information.\nThis was a local crime, covered up by local police, he claimed.\nAfter all this time, we deserve answers,’ he said. ‘We deserve to know why this happened – and why the police failed us so badly.”\nZaid al-Hilli has also hired renowned French lawyer William Bourdon\nI wonder when the French Authorities will be explaining about the play acting in an airfield near Paris?\nThat was apparently, about six months ago.\nI do not know why it is claimed the entire shooting lasted no more than ninety seconds, if they were basing their “presentation” on the claims of W.B.M. that means they beieved W.B.M.\nHowever, now they are discrediting W.B.M.\ntherefor the ninety second timeline is not still in play?\nWhy burn your best witness?\nmichael norton wrote “now they are discrediting W.B.M.” and he is correct.\nWhen this tragedy comes to trial the gendarmes are going to need WBM. He is their premier witness.\nYet the gendarmes unnecessarily threw him under the bus, describing him as ‘having made a mistake in his testimony’ and emphasising that he was off by 1 Kilometer in his reported location. There was no need to do this. No need at all.\nThe defence will now have a field day. The majority of the witnesses in and around the combe are compromised in some way or other. Can you imagine putting LMC on the stand? Or ONF1?\nThe manipulation of the timeline.\nI doubt the police are manipulating the timeline, or if they are, they are not the originators of that policy.\nThere is most likely government/special services/military intelligence, behind the manipulation of the timeline.\nNobody heard anything.\nNobody saw anything.\nNobody knows anything.\nHow often would four people be mass murdered with a one hundred year old shooter, nothing is traced, completely no clues, it is barely believable.\nThe question has occurred to me -Why is anybody (official) even releasing any information at this point?\nThey obviously want to obfuscate what happened; the best coarse of action was to stop talking and wait for the public to forget about it but in particular the French (incl Press) can’t seem to stop banging on about it while still going round in pointless circles.\nThese pokes and digs re. WBM could be inter-agency sniping; trash-talking, mostly from the French and while the Brits have largely stopped talking a while ago, that could be a clue as to which side ultimately screwed up (on someone else’s territory) and the injured agency having to reluctantly keep the truth buried. It has the feel of bickering/bringing up old gripes.\nMr. al-Hill was British, their two children are British\nbut was Mrs. al-Hilli British?\nWas in fact Mrs. al-Hilli actually legally married to Mr. al-Hilli?\nI have notes they were reported in UK media as married in Surrey in 2003.\nIt has also been said that her 1st marriage to Mr Thompson was not actually finally annulled until after the UK marriage so that might have impact on legality?.\nThe Al-Hillis met in late 2002 so it seems like it was a bit of a rush.\nIf we could better flesh out the long term movements, between countries of Mrs. al-Hilli, we might learn some things about her status, in each of these lands.\nI think I understood she became a citizen of the United States of America.\nI think I understood she legally married Mr. Thompson in the U.S.A.\nThen I think I understood, she left Thompson on good terms and moved to Dubai.\n“As of 2024, the city has a population of around 3.79 million, more than 90% of whom are expatriates.”\nDuring her time in Dubai, probably training as a dentist, she remained married to Mr.Thompson.\nHowever, if she had gone to the trouble of becoming a citizen of the U.S.A., then marrying Mr.Thompson, if she wished to continue her training as a dentist, the obvious choice, would be to do that in the U.S.A.\nPerhaps Mrs. al-hilli was still a citizen of the U.S.A. at the time of her death?\nThis can be checked, as all U.S.A. citizens, wherever they live in the world must submit tax returns to the IRS.\nSo, if Mrs. al-Hilli remained a citizen of the U.S.A. she would have to file a tax form, each year and pay what was owed.\nIf you do not do that, they will come after you, there is no stopping them.\nShe would have been filing tax returns to the IRS during he working stay in Dubai.\nI do not think it is all that easy to become a citizen of the United States of America.\nSome people live there many years and are still not citizens.\nFor Kelly to be granted citizenship so quickly, there must have been something in it for the American State.\n@michael norton March 11, 2025 at 19:11\nIt is quite possible she remained a US citizen( or maybe she only got a green card) ; it is quite involved to legally rescind even a Green Card.\nWhether she files IRS taxes, which would be highly likely to be owing zero dollars, or if she didn’t bother filing, it would not connect to her citizenship status which even these days are separate departments. I mean to say if she didn’t file, that would not mean she automatically lost her citizenship because if it did then all you need to do to rescind citizenship and remove that obligation would be to not file.\nIn those days INS and IRS did not really communicate/compute with each other.\nBut I do not know how her US immigration status affects this crime; what are you thinking?\nintp1\nI am thinking she was a spy for the U.S.A.\nIt is certainly a possibility imo, she was some kind of US asset at some, probably earlier time.\nA problem with going to UAE for a dental assistant qual is it is not transferrable to either the USA or the UK or vice versa without a rigmarole, paying for a test and to register in a new country etc, so why go there to study if she wasn’t to remain there?\nThere is no reports that she ever worked in dentistry or worked at all as far as I know.\nI am assuming that some of the Authorities in the U.S.A. knew her real name ( I do not know her real name),\nsomeone in America, would need to know her “provenance”.\nLet us guess, was she born in Iran?\nShe seems, as a person who moved seamlessly from one state to another, assuming different identities or non de plume.\nThey U.S.A. must have wanted her, to accept all this shift-shaping.\nI wonder where they recruited her?\nSo a useful question would be.\nWhere was she hanging out, before her living in America?\nI get the impression, that they do not want people with multiple identities, to move to America.\nFor new citizens, they want to understand who you actually are, where have you been living since birth, have you been arrested for much?\nWhat is the complexity of your familial heritage?\nThere is a possibility that the al-Hilli family were lured to France.\nPerhaps they were lured to France to be killed.\nPerhaps they were lured to France, so they did not have to be killed in England?\nTir Fichant or Sheer Necessity?\nI wonder if the analysis based on the reconstruction has reached the correct conclusion. To me, it seems that the killer absolutely had to get in close for the final shots. Think about it this way, after the first shot through the side windows the glass, being tempered, crazes and becomes opaque. So to continue to make accurate precise shots, the killer simply has to close any distance from the car and fire at point blank range. I think that the killer also may have used the muzzle of the luger to tap out part of the shattered glass to make a little portal to shoot through. The final shots then would be taken with the muzzle either inside (or just outside) the car. This would also muffle the shots to some extent.\nI fully agree that the shooter was experienced but what has been suggested as a specialist skill may simply be that he adapted quickly and successfully to the fast changing and chaotic conditions.\nIf the shootist had shot the windows out to shoot the three people in their heads, why did W.B.M. claim he had to break a window, presume he meant driver’s window, to turn off the engine.\nWhy (Claim) break a window that had already been shot out?\nSaad had multiple gunshot wounds, I doubt he got all those shots outside of the vehicle, then climbed into the vehicle to try and drive off.\nI guess, if W.B.M. wished to turn the ignition off, he would first try the driver’s door handle?\nIf there was some central locking in operation, so that none of the doors could open, can that be overridden by putting your hand through the window and pulling up the pin?\nI can’t believe, that if central locking is engaged, the driver crashes and becomes dead or dying, the engine catches fire, the back seat passengers have to die in a fireball because they cannot escape the vehicle?\nIf the shootist had killed Sylvain Mollier and all the occupants of the vehicle, you might have thought that shootist would gain entry to that car, to check the people were all deceased, to search for something in that vehicle?\nSo have we ever been told that the vehicle still had engaged central locking?\nThis could be crucial.\nThink about this, a shootist turns up, shoots Saad and William Brett Martin.\nSaad manages to get in the car and tries to drive off, does he have time to engage central locking?\nSorry, that last bit was wrong.\nThis could be crucial.\nThink about this, a shootist turns up, shoots Saad al-Hilli and Sylvain Mollier.\nSaad manages to get in the car and tries to drive off, does he have time to engage central locking?\n@michael norton\nIt is all a bit complex, I could be wrong but my understanding is that a BMW of that era would automatically lock the doors when it was in reverse for obvious safety reasons and it would continue to be locked when it was in motion.\nImportantly the computer controlling the locks etc would still think the car was in motion when the car was actually ‘stuck’ up against the bank because the wheels were spinning as it dug into the bank. So some sensor or other ‘knew’ that the wheels were still turning and the control logic inferred that the car was in motion.\nI thought that WBM was perfectly reasonable in his actions when he ‘broke’ the drivers window to stop the engine. However the window itself was already ‘broken’ in the sense of being ‘crazed’ and having one or more bullet holes in it. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he ‘pushed in’ part of the remaining glass to gain access to the cabin. If I recall correctly, it was reported that he got a minor cut on his hand as he did so.\nMore info on the Danish camper in link below – it should be noted that he has now been eliminated.\nhttps://www.rtl.fr/actu/justice-faits-divers/tuerie-de-chevaline-quelles-sont-les-quatre-pistes-privilegiees-par-les-enqueteurs-7900471049\nFinally, the past of the victim Iqbal Al-Hillli, the mother of the family, remains another avenue to explore. Thirteen years before the tragedy, she married for the first time on July 28, 1999, in the United States, to a certain James Dudley Thompson, who was found dead of an “apparent heart attack” on September 5, 2012, the same day as the Chevaline massacre. No autopsy was performed. “Investigators believe they have not yet fully investigated the question of whether she belonged at some point in her life, perhaps even to an intelligence service,” explains Ronan Folgoas, a journalist at Le Parisien . This time spent in the United States raises questions: the conditions in which she married, the speed of her marriage, her rather hasty departure from the United States…”\nVery interesting.\nI have always assumed the spies were Mrs. al-hilli and her “mother”\nJames Dudley Thompson, may have been her legal husband but he was playing a part, playing the part of a normal family, this to give Ikbal, a “cover” story.\nSaad al-Hilli may have been her husband but he, also, was playing a “cover” family role – part.\nI guess, by the Surrey time, she was mostly a “sleeper”\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05453-y\nKap København Formation in North Greenland, dated to around two million years ago.\nEske Willerslev\nEnvironmental DNA\nIf environmental DNA can draw a picture from two million years ago, in Northern Greenland,\nperhaps environmental DNA could draw a picture from twelve and a half years ago from France?\nMaybe the Authorites could ask Danish man, Eske Willerslev to offer his expertise?",

For the first time in 200 years it has overtaken Glasgow in population. Its housing is becoming prohibitively expensive for ordinary citizens. A two bedroom flat carved out of a converted house goes for £250,000 in a “normal” area. Three bed family homes are well over £350,000 in much of the city.\nIn any state, the capital sucks in economic resources from the rest of the country, because that is where the centre of government services lies. London currently absorbs an awful lot of Scottish taxpayers’ money, and the Treasury counts projects such as crossrail as a UK, not just English, benefit – a fact worth remembering when you look at GERS figures.\nAn independent Scotland will need new ministries of foreign affairs, defence, and immigration/security, and a much bigger ministry of finance. It will need a central bank. On top of which it will receive at least 60 foreign embassies and also, and often forgotten, about the same again in national offices of international institutions like the EU, World Bank, IMF, EBRD, etc. That also comes with an economic boom to supply all the needed accommodation and infrastructure.\nBut that is by no means all. Edinburgh is already a huge international finance sector. Insurance companies, fund managers and banks based in Edinburgh manage more assets than are held in the Paris, behind only London and Frankfurt in the EU. If the rest of the UK plunges out of the EU while Scotland stays in, where will be the obvious bolthole for financial institutions wishing to headquarter in a location which gives continued free access to EU markets, while minimising dislocation effects and need for new languages? Edinburgh.\nThat is not the only benefit which a Scotland still in the EU will gain from the new situation. The astonishing xenophobia south of the border is dictating a severe reduction in numbers of overseas students. If Scotland is independent and still in the EU, which English speaking destination with superb universities will those students go to instead? The continued expansion of the University and of student accommodation is already out of hand in Edinburgh city centre – this will get worse.\nThe truth is, post independence the economic boom which will hit Edinburgh will be more than the city can physically handle. It will be much more sensible to remove the public sector element – the functions and accretions of a capital city – to another destination.\nThis will shock traditionalists, but Edinburgh will always have its history and the tourists that come with it. There are older capitals available. Dunkeld of the Picts probably does not have enough available land. But Perth does, close to the ancient installation site of the rulers at Scone. Scone Palace would be a magnificent residence for Scotland’s President after Lizzie is given her marching orders.\nMany countries have moved to brand new capitals. My own choice of capital would be Dundee. The railway, road and airport connections already exist and the Caird Hall could be converted to a magnificent parliament. The seat of Scottish government is currently Ruth Davidson’s constituency – surely it would be much better to move it to Yes City.\n‘London currently absorbs an awful lot of Scottish taxpayers’ money, and the Treasury counts projects such as crossrail ‘\nNationalist myth no.6789.\nThere is nothing in GERS to back this up.\nMust do better Craig!\nso where is the money for x rail/hs2/3 etc coming from? the budget for england?\nhttps://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/barnett_consequentials_crossrail\nWhat was the author of the article smokIng?

The central belt is so OVER! ☺☺☺☺\nThe United Kingdom economy grew faster than expected in the three months after the BREXIT vote, official figures have indicated.\nOur economy expanded by 0.5% in the July-to-September period, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe Economic case for an Independent Scotland is not self evident.\nThis jumping selectively on a single statistic, be it unemployment, wages, growth, inflation, etc out of context is one of the things which trivialises so much political debate and brings it down to a game of ping-pong (No offence intended to table tennis players – there’s is a real sport!).\nSuch statistics have a margin of error, and are regularly refined as more information becomes available. We have to look at trends and a raft of statistics dealing with similar areas to form a better view.\nCompletely agree Alasdair, it is only a few months since the momentous decision of the people to cast off from the hated\nEuropean Union.

I’m told the average adjustment of the preliminary GDP growth figure is 0.34%. So it could be anywhere from 0.1% to 0.8% growth.\nOn the contrary, if the UK can grow after deciding to Brexit, why can’t Scotland after deciding to Scexit?\nIs marmalade still made in Dundee?\nDundee Marmalade\nThe Scottish city of Dundee has a long association with marmalade. James Keiller and his wife Janet ran a small sweet and preserves shop in the Seagate section of Dundee. In 1797, they opened a factory to produce “Dundee Marmalade”, a preserve distinguished by thick chunks of bitter Seville orange rind.\nScots legend\nAccording to a Scottish legend, the creation of orange marmalade in Britain occurred by accident. The legend tells of a ship carrying a cargo of oranges that broke down in the port of Dundee, resulting in some ingenious locals making marmalade out of the cargo.’\nKeiller do not appear to exist now. They were acquired by Robertsons who were in turn acquired by an American conglomerate called Hain. There is no mention of preserves in their product list.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hain_Celestial_Group\nHello Sharp Ears:\n‘Marmalado’ is presumably the original source of the word marmalade. It is Portuguese for essentially-fruit jam/preserve. I dare say there is a similar Spanish word.\nI am not sure why the word was adopted in this country to mean, in particular, a preserve of oranges, but it seems likely or plausible that it is borrowed from the Spanish or Portuguese.\nIOW , somehow a preserve of bitter oranges was originally made in Iberia, and called (generically) Marmalado -and being discovered by some Scottish traveller, the term was ‘anglified’ or perhaps Scottified to particularise the seville orange variety of preserve. i.e. a category error.\nSeville oranges are themselves not very edible,and seem to resemble ‘wild oranges’. They are very similar to oranges that grow on purely ornamental garden varieties of orange tree-seen often in Florida-which of course, was originally a Spanish colony. I was in Florida a few years ago and noticed the ornamental tree in the garden of the people i was staying with had fruits which seemed suitable for marmalade.\nMarmalade is actually quite a laborious form of preserve to make properly, although it can be made by various simpler, inferior methods which do not quite capture the flavour in the same way.\nI suspect the Keiller story is somewhat apocryphal- in the sense that the idea of orange marmalade was imported into an area already familiar with preserving soft fruit -coinciding with the slave/sugar era. The preservation of fruit in a strong sugar syrup can only have been possible once the price of sugar had reached some level that made it viable to make marmalade, to market to a population able to afford such luxuries.\nOne also suspects that the ‘seville’ oranges were extremely cheap-as I said they seems to grow profusely and have rather limited other culinary use, so I can imagine that ship loads of the fruit might be imported quite cheaply.\nCuriously, around 1982 or ’83, someone i knew bought a rather large and distinguished house, just off the Ballater ‘bypass’ in the Cairngorms area, from the last (or near last) remnant of the Keiler family, an elderly woman, who i seem to remember, was a spinster living in somewhat faded glory.\nThere was something a little bit odoriferous’ about the deal. It had a hint of exploitativeness- a sharp operator who persuaded the elderly woman to part with the house at a very advantageous price on some condition, that was ignored within a very short period of time after the transaction was completed.\nThe buyer went on to become a councillor for Aberdeenshire.\nBest\nPaddington Bear\nChris Law?\nPaddington Bear\nThe English word marmalade is derived from the Portuguese word for quince- and as any budding fruit and veg/allotment lover in southern England knows (come in J Corbyn)- where quince bushes thrive near their northern climatic limit- there are notably hard work at being turned into something palatable.The fruits are smaller than apples but with a similar sized core so there is a lot of wastage, and they have a rather blandly bitter taste on their own- the original preserve from which the word derives was sweetened with honey.\nI get a decent crop from the garden most years, and after trial and error turn have learned to turn them into a palatable preserve with plenty of caster sugar, and, the important added ingredient, ginger. Should get into double figures in terms of jars again this year which, as the ghastly supermarket ad goes, means ‘every little helps’ with both the food bill, and the elimination of air miles from commercially manufactured marmalades, which still rely to large extent on Seville oranges and lemons.\nThe Scottish Health Minister, Shona Robison, is unhappy about the way in which the NHS is being run.\nWish we had her instead of Hunt and May.\nHealth minister Shona Robison wants way NHS is run to change\n1 hour ago\nVideo\nShe was speaking to the BBC following the publication of an Audit Scotland report which said that the health service needed to make unprecedented savings in 2016/17.\nMs Robison said: “We have already committed the lion’s share of government money to health – that will increase again by £2bn over the course of this parliament.\n“But just putting more and more money into the health service isn’t enough.\n“We have to reform the way we run our services, we have to change the way we run our services, that is why we have to integrate health and social care.”\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37787036\nShona Robison, MSP Dundee City East. Sadly she and her husband Stewart Hosie have separated.\nhttp://www.parliament.scot/msps/currentmsps/shona-robison-msp.aspx\nSharp Ears.\nAudit Scotland’s said that NHS Scotland is struggling, due to a aging population, even though it has employed more staff than ever, and, spending on it has risen 2.7% to, £12.2 billion.\nPeople over the age of 75, in Scotland, has risen, by over 11.8%, in the last 7 years, and the cost of drugs to treat conditions, has also risen by 10%.\nHowever, I’m not particularly worried at the present, Audit Scotland, also claimed that compared to NHS services, in the rest of the UK, and in other countries, who also provide universal care, Scotland’s NHS service, is in reasonably good shape.\nI always thought Stirling would have been the best place for our new parliament/government. There is tons of space, it’s central and accessible to the whole country, has two airports within reach, railways, good bit of history thrown in and it certainly looks the part.\nagreed!\nMy choice would be Stirling. Lot of space.\nI don’t believe it should be moved. Just because other countries have done it is no reason for Scotland to do so for a variety of reasons. Edinburgh is expensive, yes – but not because it is a capital but because so much else is centred around it.\nWhile industry, finance, trade, shipping etc may have initially developed Edinburgh-centric because it was the capital, that trend started 500 years ago and continued until relatively recently because of the need to physically travel for communication and to conduct business. Over the past half-millenium we have undergone a unity/political revolution, an industrial revolution, transport & educational revolutions and now the ‘communications revolution’, all of which have culminated in making business and education far less dependent on one’s physical proximity to another.\nFinance & other light industry can flourish almost anywhere now, thanks to the internet. There is no reason why many businesses moving north cannot relocate to Aberdeen, Wick, Thurso or even Lerwick providing HS BB & effective transport links can be guaranteed. We don’t even need to travel or meet in person now – we email, FB or video conference. In hundred years we may be able to ‘beam’ goods/people from place to place – goodbye trains, trucks, cars, planes as necessities for trade & travel.\nIn Edinburgh we have an almost-new parliament building which cost MANY MILLIONS to build. Why would we NOT use it for at least 100 years, if not 200 years? We also have excellent universities in Dundee, the H&I which does all sorts of outreach learning, Aberdeen, Glasgow and colleges in Thurso and other smaller centres, etc. Why not concentrate efforts on making them as highly regarded as Edinburgh so they will attract students to them on their own merits? In Canada some smaller regional colleges offer Uni courses with full credit to the ‘parent’ facility, ie UVic & Camosun College. No reason we cannot do that here in places like Thurso, etc.\nWe could build a new Uni in an area with very little else in it now. Entire new towns have been built around industry/service industry, ie Milton Keynes, where little else has previously existed – why not instead build a brand new university town from scratch in (for instance) Lairg, specialising in wilderness ecosystems, forest sciences, fresh water sciences, etc?

In this plan, Perth (in the geographic (more or less) centre of Scotland would be the Capital. The Central Belt would end up as one city; Aberdeen/ Dundee and Inverness would have different Hub-City identities serving the North-East And North-West of the country respectively; and perhaps we would incorporate a couple of North English cities to be Hubs for the economic development to the South. Btw such as tunnels to Ireland and the Orkneys, transportation, energy and sustainable environment plans would be important infrastructure projects in this plan leading to a formulation of a ‘Dream’ which would lead a large majority of Scottish voters to believe in our Independence.\nMr. Benton\ncan you let us know where you will get the money from?\nROYAL BANK of SCOTLAND sees more losses in third quarter\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37796446\nRoyal Bank of Scotland has reported a £469m loss for the July-to-September period as “legacy issues” continue to overshadow its performance.\nThe bank received a £45.5bn bailout during the financial crisis and has been tackling a range of problems.\nWhy not be independent from the rest of the United kingdom and take a leading role in the European Union,\ngood question.\nWhy leave?

Prof. Murphy is the author of ‘The Joy of Tax’. Unfortunately, I did not attend, but these are his speaking notes copied from his blog:\n“Scotland needs its own economy\nIt can’t have that unless it has its own tax system\nAnd it can’t have an effective tax system unless it has control of its own currency\nWhich it can only have if its independent and not in the EU\nThat’s something of a conundrum but a state on the periphery of the European economy can’t reflect its own values, strengths and weaknesses, as well as its social priorities in its economy unless it is willing to state that its own identity matters\nAnd for tax this matters\nBecause for centuries we’ve thought that governments tax and spend\nBut that’s not true: we spend and tax\nYou can’t pay tax in a currency until someone has created it\nA government with its own currency creates that money: it decides how much it spends into the economy and how much it wants to claim back by way of tax\nWhat that means is that a government with its own currency can run a fiscal policy\nAnd by definition it has a central bank and so must have a monetary policy\nWhich means it is in control of its economic decision making\nBut if it does not have its own currency it simply has to balance its books – because it will always be in debt to someone else in that case, which is not true if it has its own money\nWe know that because QE has now proved a government with its own currency can cancel its own debt\nAnd even pay for public services without tax\nAnd in that case tax becomes something really important. Although it has a key role to play in preventing inflation resulting from money creation the way it is used to do\nthat makes tax a key element in the delivery of social policy\nSo redistribution is key\nAnd repricing to compensate for market failure is key\nAs is the way tax subsidies are given vital to make sure social justice is delivered\nBut that also means unpaid tax is not then just an issue of the books not balancing – it’s also a failure to deliver social policy\nSo tax avoidance increases inequality – because avoidance is something only the better off can afford to do\nAnd evasion matters because it usually means a cheating business gets an unfair competitive advantage over an honest one\nAnd subsidising the savings of the wealthy, the rental activities of the best off, the investment activity of big business and not small, and so much more, are all ways to ensure that social and economic inequality increase\nMy message then is a simple one: those who want a socially just Scotland have to understand the essential linked elements of money, economic policy and tax and how tax has n essential role in delivering social policy in that environment, and not paying for services. Only then can Scotland understand what it would mean to be a truly independent and socially just society\nAnd if you do that, would you send me an invitation? End”\nUnderstanding the financial operations of a monetarily sovereign government is the key to holding our elected representatives to account. This is particularly important during a time of imposed austerity, which is doing great damage to our economy further impoverishing the weakest members of society.\nDundee the capital? You’re seriously joking Craig. I lived there for six years and it was the most insular city I’ve had the misfortune to stay in. As people said to me, “Dundonians don’t have a chip on their shoulder, it’s a fish supper.” Locals used to go to the Perth Road to find students to beat up. Wonder what they’d do to the diplomatic community!\nis it true there is a pub in Dundee called The Hag?\nThey have an efergy of Frau Nicola swinging off the gables\nSitrling, Perth or Inverness should be the main candidates: Stirling for its historical role, Perth for its central location, and Inverness for its current dynamism and to shift the balance of power radically to the north.",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2006_03_britain_moves_t/content_12.html": "By SUE LEEMAN in Seattlepi.com\nLONDON – Britain issued new rules for diplomats Wednesday to stop the publishing of tell-all memoirs such as a recent portrayal of Prime Minister Tony Blair as starstruck and senior ministers as “political pygmies.”\nMinisters were chagrined in November when former ambassador to the United States Sir Christopher Meyer published his explosive “D.C. Confidential.” Meyer depicted Blair as starstruck and failing to stand up for Britain in the run-up to the Iraq war, and he described senior Cabinet members as “political pygmies.”\nIn the memoir, Meyer also told how, as a Downing Street press secretary, he would brief former Conservative Prime Minister John Major as the premier washed and dressed in the morning, sometimes while Major’s wife, Norma, lay in bed.\nForeign Secretary Jack Straw, who has accused Meyer of breaking a trust, published new guidelines Wednesday which specifically prevent Foreign Office staff from “writing anything that would damage the confidential relationship between ministers, or between ministers and officials.” Meyer’s book was submitted to the Cabinet Office which also consulted the Foreign Office before it was published.\nBritain’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, has published documents he says prove that Britain knowingly received intelligence extracted under torture from prisoners in the former Soviet state. Murray was sacked over the allegations.\nThe revised guidelines advise that “the good conduct of government requires ministers to have confidence that they can have full and frank discussions with officials, without concern that these may then appear in the public domain.”\n\"Britain's former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, has published documents he says prove that Britain knowingly received intelligence extracted under torture from prisoners in the former Soviet state. Murray was sacked over the allegations.\"\nCraig Murray doesn't have to publish his book. It's pretty obvious government ministers are complicit in these crimes. Lie after lie after lie is all we've had from them.\nShame on the British public for allowing Tony Blair, a psychopath, to get away with bullshitting the public.\nBlair, the Christian? \"God\" advising him? How can anyone be so stupid as to believe such crap? Blair should have been kicked out of the Parkinson studio, and told to go right to hell. How dare he insult the public's intelligence like this.\nFirst, Blair condemns religious extremism, then he says \"God\" told me to invade Iraq. In other words, he participated in bombing another nation not for a rational, legal, and moral reason; rather, he did so, blindly, on \"God's\" advice.\nDidn't someone assassinate a former Israeli Prime Minister on \"God's\" advice?\nBlair, by his own admission, is a religious extremist, and by his own definition, that makes him part of the cause of terrorism, and therefore a threat to the world.\nFor 18 long years the British kept the Tories in power. And for 18 long years, the British will keep Labour in power.\nNo wonder government ministers spit on the British people, on human rights, and on democracy.\nThis latest series of rulings is entirely for the benefit of Ministers. There's no equivalent ruling to stop Ministers from 'leaking'. It's evident that some Ministers seem to regard it as their duty to leak.\nDamage to 'confidential relationships' goes on all the time the world over. So what? The 'important' thing (as those clowns in Downing Street so often say) is the National Interests. And in this respect it's clear that New Labour lost the plot many years ago.\nI do not think that Meyer's book was much more than an entertaining read. His 'revelations' were pretty superficial – although quite amusing. That people like Straw or Blair get embarrassed by this sort of gossip is a measure of them, rather than the authors.\nMen of greater stature would merely laugh and shrug it off, but these pygmies take umbrage at anything which might indicate their own human failings. How pathetic. They need to get out a bit more.\nChuck wrote: \"The 'important' thing (as those clowns in Downing Street so often say) is the National Interests. And in this respect it's clear that New Labour lost the plot many years ago.\"\nWhat does \"national interests\" mean?\nIt seems to be a term that has no clear definition; it means different things to different people; it has the kind of ambiguity politicians love.\nDoes it mean what's in the public's interest? What's in the interest of transnational corporations? What's in the interest of society's privileged classes? Or, perhaps, it's just something that's convenient for politicians to say.\nIf Blair doesn't want to give a proper explanation for something (that's most of the time!), he can just say it's being done in the national interest.\nExample 1: Want to keep Britain out of the Euro? Blair says it \"would be a betrayal of our national interests\".\nThank God that's cleared up!\nExample 2: Want a country that doesn't hold on to America's coattails? According to Blair, Britain's role as a U.S. ally (read \"handmaiden\") is in its \"national interests\".\nGlad that's sorted.\nThe term ought to be dropped.\nFathers say to their \"recalcitrant\" children: \"You will do it because I SAY SO!\"\nBlair says to a \"disobedient\" British nation: \"You must support me, because IT'S IN THE NATIONAL INTERESTS!\"\nWOOOOO! Blair, you're scaring us.\nAccording to Blair, it's also in our \"national interests\" to support corporate globalization. In other words, the public should defend U.S. corporations like Betchel (with British corporations working under them) taking over Bolivia's water supply (just one example), hiking the prices, and when the Bolivian people, who live on $960 a year (equivalent to a U.S. income of $2700), balk, and decide to use rain water instead (which, naturally, they think is free), we should support Betchel turning around and saying, sorry, but that's a criminal offence – you can't touch the rain water without OUR permission!\nAfter many protests and not one or two injuries and deaths later, the Bolivian people finally got their water supply back.\nBut things still look pretty bleak for them. And they'll start to look pretty bleak for us, too, if we keep on listening to Blair and his cohorts' murderous talk.\nIn the above comment, \"Betchel\" should be spelled \"Bechtel\".\nI wrote: \"After many protests and not one or two injuries and deaths later, the Bolivian people finally got their water supply back.\"\nI should have written:\n\"After many protests, and not one or two injuries and deaths later, BUT MANY, the Bolivian people finally got their water supply back.\"\nThat's what happens when you make a post at 6:25 in the morning.\nWell, some will understand the term 'National Interests' and some will not. Maybe that understanding also depends on a perception of Britain as an entity – as opposed to a loose conglomeration on English, Scots, Welsh, Irish etc, or any other random groupings which one may choose.\nThe fact that Blair and others have chosen to distort or nuance the meanings of commonly accepted terms in their political utterances is regrettable if not unexpected. However, for many people the English Language remains relatively clear and unambiguous. I count myself as one of them.\nBut, to take Richard's (early morning) point and given the current levels of credibility, perhaps we should ask our politicians to explain precisely why or how any course of action they propose may benefit the British people when they declare that something is in the 'National Interests'.",

It’s certainly comforting to know that several millions of viewers have already watched your numerous documentaries, usually not on YouTube as this channel is held in dubious hands, and even tries to belittle your work by showing a really dismal number of views.\nLike in the best movies of the late Antonioni, many times we have a welcomed feeling of déjà vu, the latest documentary seeming to be like a new edit of a former one, both blending magically into our minds.\nWe’re so glad you resisted the easy temptation of using gore, and avoided us the sight of slaughtered children. But we know how difficult it must be for you to confront such horror. The criminals responsible must be brought to justice sooner or later, and you shall be a witness for the prosecution when the day comes.\nBest of luck for the forthcoming videos, and don’t exclude making the trip to Damascus, where as you know plenty of crimes are committed and unreported by you-know-who…\nMost UK citizens are either unaware of what Israel has done in Lebanon, or have been exposed only to Israeli propaganda.\nI have no idea what we can do about this, if anything.\nBeware “widest possible audience”-ism.\nThis is what the BDS movement (which calls for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against the Zionist entity) says about Google, the pro-Zionist outfit that owns Youtube and is helping with the genocide by supplying cloud computing technology to the “IDF”:\nhttps://bdsmovement.net/tags/google\nThose who are interested in this company should know that as well as supplying the Chrome web browser it also supplies important parts of most of the other web browsers, including Edge and Opera. It also spies on almost every act of browsing to every webpage in the western world, by supplying (nudge nudge) font services. (Check a webpage’s source code to verify.) In case any readers didn’t already know, it also spies on every phone that runs the Android operating system.\nEverything that helps promote Youtube – or any other service supplied by Google (Alpha) – as some kind of agency of the common good helps kill Palestinians. Agencies of Google are not agencies of the common good. They are baby burners.\nBrian, ‘they’ all do it. If you’re on the Internet you’re at risk from the data gatherers (all Apps) and the data monitors (GCHQ, NSA, Five Eyes). There is NO safe space. Russia and China are not the problem, it’s our own governments and their lackie’s.\nWho supplied the 2,000lb bombs that shredded and burned babies in a concentration camp, Brian?\nCompanies that enthusiastically support the Donald/Elon duo.\nAs a coincidence they themselves rule X and Truth Social, both networks very supportive of ethnic cleansing (so-called cleaning) in Palestine.\nEven though Boy is right in stressing that there’s no safe place on the Internet (think Pegasus scam), Red is in the blue. Google is NOT our friend, and using any of their services is somewhat self-defeating.\nBad enough to have to submit to proclaimed advocates of free speech who meanwhile don’t flinch at suppressing your comments whenever they see fit.\nAudience is a confusing metric…\nDear Craig\nThank you for bearing witness.\nMy wife and I were reflecting upon the President of Ireland’s Mansion House National Holocaust Memorial Day Commemoration Speech.\nIt seems that all the endless killing and gratuitous destruction is actually revenge for the Holocaust.\nBullies have always suffered trauma or abuse and consequently experience an overwhelming need to express their frustration and anger.\nInvariably this uncontrollable emotion is gratified by simply beating up an entirely unassociated and innocent victim, who is close to hand, physically weaker and therefore more easy to exploit. Think playground, think domestic violence.\nThis is what we are witnessing in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, South Lebanon and anywhere within easy reach of Israel: a terrifying and absolute example of the bully and its victims.\nThe leaders of Israel and their military hold the hurt of the Holocaust and its devastating impact upon their parents and grandparents so close to their hearts that they refuse to see what they do.\nAll bullies need to be told, ‘No’. All bullies need to be helped to understand that the source of their anger is within themselves.\nThe Israeli leadership need to learn to understand that their Muslim and Christian neighbours are not a threat to their existence.\nAs in the examples of playground bullies and abusers of women, they have to learn the real cause of their unhappiness and realise that if they can be helped to come to terms with that, then there is a future through reconcilliation and peace.\nThis is not amateur psychology: it is well understood now how unresolved trauma and abuse suffered usually in early childhood, but not always, is the root cause of psychosis and murder. True healing from of the effects of the Holocaust is taking generations to achieve. Clearly there is much hard and compassionate work yet to be done. We live always with hope.\nThat’s all well and good, but none of these people have any “unresolved trauma and abuse”.\nI’m sure that’s a significant factor Will, but there is also a built-in supremicism in many Israeli zionist Jews (and non-Jewish zionists around the world).\nI was thinking about this a couple of days ago, which I haven’t done before, and I realised that whereas if someone has an inferiority complex, it’s regarded by the person with it as a problem, and they can potentially be helped by psychologists to overcome it, but people with a superiority complex – which is what it amounts to – don’t regard it as a problem that needs fixing, and it’s so innate and internalised anyway that they have no consciousness of it in the vast majority of cases (as opposed to someone like Trump, who IS aware of it, and relishes it).\nSupremicism killed and murdered six million Jews, and millions of others, and has killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the past sixteen months. And the very nature of supremicism blocks out empathy. As far as I’m aware, Jews are the only people on the planet who are led to believe they are the chosen ones… And how messed up is that!\nCertain things are supposed to be taken on spec and are not allowed to be rationally discussed or properly analysed. If you do you’re a denier and an antisemite. Fanatics cannot allow their lies to be exposed.\nAllan Howard\nI would not say all Jews are Supremacists – Hitler could be construed as a Catholic Christian Supremacist on a similar basis.\nThe historical facts appear to me to be pretty simple ( for all Jews) and that is: all the countries that are defending Israel for the wrong reasons now were the ones then who didn’t want them in Europe/USA and in pre – Revolutionary and in some areas post revolutionary Russia then.\nThe Christian Zionists in Britain spotted an opportunity and gave the co Zionists and liberal Kibbutz style Jews a ‘ Homeland’\nIt didn’t matter to the British that people already lived there and it certainly didn’t matter to Israel Zionists neither – arrangements were agreed and opportunities were taken.\nSadly ( and we revisit the caring sharing West again ) those Jews who could not escape/getaway were sent to the Camps to be murdered alongside many Communists – left liberals – gays and lesbians as well as intellectuals – journalists ( those against the Regime of any critical political stripe – even Conservatives) who wrote books and were involved in the Arts and so on.\nMost Jews who did escape because they had already seen what was coming stayed away from the whole game ( the wiser ones) knowing that the foundation of Israel would be trouble.\nAnd here they and we as well as the Palestinians are.\nSo, the West is wringing its’ fake Liberal’ hands bemoaning the fate of two religions and peoples in which they actually had a massive involvement in the creation of Israel historically – it was mainly their plan and their fault.\nFortunately for the MSM and many other Zionists ( Christian or Jewish) they can only pass on what they know which is ‘ Well they started it! ‘ juvenile stuff – conveniently ignoring the fact of cause and effect historically.\nThere are people on this board who know miles more than I do about the actual history but, the most repugnant thing is the one’s allegedly reporting current history very little or no knowledge of history.\nAnd the bad news for all concerned with the truth is that, they have no intention of finding out as salary and income triumphs over truth and humanity.\n‘ Only Obeying Orders?’ – ‘ Only Doing My Job.’\nWhere have we heard that before?\n‘I would not say all Jews are Supremacists’\nNo, of course not Mark, and there are of course many good caring empathetic Jewish people, the folks at Jewish Voice for Labour being the perfect example. It was an oversight on my part not to mention the fact, and it occurred to me about ten minutes or so after I posted my comment that I didn’t mention the fact, and my intention was to rectify that in a reply to myself, so to speak. And THAT is what I just came back to do, and saw your comment, as such, and I’d thought that someone might have pointed it out in the meantime, and they HAD…. you, that is, Mark.\nAnd as I’ve said on one or more occasions before, just about all the people living in the kibbutzim close to the Gaza border were on the left politically, and despised the likes of Netanyahu and Co, as with just about everyone at the Nova trance rave. And that’s why BN and his fascist buddies didn’t do anything to counter the attack in the months prior to October 7th, because THEY despise lefties and free thinkers, and relished the thought of them being killed, and turned into charcoal by Israeli helicopter gunships. They were expendable.\n@Allan – “People living in the kibbutzim close to the Gaza border” ??? That will be occupiers in settlements a short way outside a camp fence.\nWhat on Earth is with the reference to “kibbutzim” as though that kind of land thieves’ settlement was something lovely?\nHow many Palestinians do you think have ever been members of “kibbutzim” in Palestine?\nMostly a “kibbutz” is a settlement built on territory occupied in 1948, often at the far reaches thereof, and I really don’t give a damn for the notion that “we have good relations with our local Arabs” that some of them until recently tried to sell.\nMr Mark Cutts.\n” Hitler could be construed as a Catholic Christian Supremacist on a similar basis.”\nYes, Germany is/was a Christian country, most Germans were Christians either Catholic or Lutheran Protestant an as a result hated Jews. They hated Jews because of the messages of Christian Gospels. The gospel writers had two separate agendas, the primary one was to propagate the impractical ideas of the apocryphal Joshua Ben Joseph of Nazareth about not being gratuitously vile to those they see as others. Every religion has such pretend ideas and they are honoured mainly in the breach. Every authoritarian society needs outsiders to persecute and use as political scapegoats. For the Nazis scapegoating Jews yielded political support because Germany was Christian. The secondary agenda in the gospels was to convince Rome that they were not blaming it for killing their God which of course they were. The inevitable result was 18 or 19 centuries of Christian murders and pogroms against Jews and thefts. That Zionists felt the need for their own state was justified, unfortunately all places where they could establish one already had indigenous people who would resist and thus needed to be removed. A quick, complete and relatively merciful genocide is far kinder than ethnic cleansing.\nThe use of the word “antisemitism” exclusively for Jew hatred is unfortunate as it prevents it being used for the Israelis dropping 900Kg US supplied bombs (and the US Citizens supplying said bombs) on Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians.The word has in fact been “stolen” by European Jews most of whom have no right to be called Semites. Yes they may have a few Semite derived genes from Levantine ancestors 2000 years ago but they are mostly generic White Europeans. The theft may have been unintentional resulting from the strong association of the word “Jew” with the Jews of the Bible age who were in fact Semites (whose descendants today are Palestinians most of whose ancestors were converted (probably by force) first to Christianity and then Islam. Nevertheless the fact that the word has been appropriated by Zionists confuses the issue of the Palestine conflict.\nIt is a gross injustice that the word “antisemitism” cannot be applied to the IDF, Itamar Ben_Gvir, Benjamin Netanyahu, Bezazel Smotrich and the Murderous thieving Israeli settlers and their Christian and Jewish supporters in the Euroamerican Empire (aka The US Empire), because the people against whom they are committing genocide or pogroms and whose land they are stealing are Semites as also are the Lebanese and Syrians on whom Israel is making war.\nZionists aren’t Jews; they are racist, fascist antisemites. It’s a fundamental mistake to confuse the two.\nJews are rather like everyone else: some of them are racists and fascists, and some aren’t.\nThere is nothing about being a Jew that determines whether a person is a fascist or on the contrary a fine fellow with a love of humanity who abhors genocide wherever it occurs.\nThe same applies to whites, blacks, Chinese, Arabs, etc. etc.\nDon’t assume the zionists, as opposed to ordinary Jews, were not complicit in the holocaust. The holocaust served a useful purpose in enabling the establishment of Israel.\nYes SB.\nFollow Tony Greenstein the “wrong type of Jew” the 1st to be kicked out of The UK Labour party under “antiracist” Jeremy Corbyn who could not recognize his enemies for what they were, enemies and allowed himself to be tricked into persecuting his allies.\nTony Greenstein has written a whole book about this issue, titled “Zionism During the Holocaust”.\nI disagree, Corbyn wasn’t ignorant or stupid, he was cowardly.\nHe wasn’t cowardly, he was in a no-win situation. But I’d be interested to know what you would have had him say in response to the A/S accusations. I’ve asked this of quite a few people on different blogs during the past seven/eight years or more. and not one single person has ever responded. And the reason why they haven’t is glaringly obvious.\nSqueeth\nI wouldn’t accuse Corbyn of being a coward.\nThe problem was that nearly all the ‘ antisemite ‘ rhetoric was aimed\npersonally at him – The rest of the Labour party obviously were attacked\nbut not as much as he was personally.\n‘ We have to break him as a man ‘ – no – not the Sun on Sunday or Sky News\nbut one of The Labour Party Apparatchiks.\nCorbyn was taken down by his own side – I’m sure he was aware that the MSM\nwould attack him and maybe he was a little naive to think that most people in the\nPLP were Labour Party loyalists at heart and genuinely wanted to get rid of the Tories.\nOn that he was utterly right and wrong at the same time.\n2017 nearly made it despite all that.\n2019 ( after the people he posed a danger to – including most\nof the PLP undermined him further ) he still scored well with 33% of the vote.\nKier ( Man at C&A ) Starmer got a similar amount in percentage terms but because of\nFPTP system he got 172/173? seats despite getting 600k less votes than Corbyn in 2019.\nNo discussion in the Democratic Media about that discrepancy neither.\nSo – no he was and is not coward – he believes in the Democratic will of the people and\nParliament and the Democracy of his Party – even now during Starmer’s office.\nHe is ( like his mentor Tony Benn) a democratic British ( not – say Cuban ) Socialist.\nNow – if you want an ‘ Operator ‘ then Ken Livingstone would have been your man.\nBut Mrs Thatcher ‘ Abolished ‘ him a long time ago.\nCorbyn was never seen as a danger to the Establishment or indeed the Labour Party.\nHe was just viewed as a Oppositionist.\nThe Labour Party Executive let him stand just to give the veneer of internal democracy\nthat’ s all.\nBut I will credit Corbyn with putting the wind up the Establishment and just for a while it\nwas great to witness them huffing and puffing and the ensuing hysteria.\nNever a dull moment with Corbyn in the political sense in those days and witnessing\nStarmer and Rachel ( No – I really am a Dalek! ) Reeves in inaction is very interesting\nto contrast and compare with Corbyn’s tenure as leader.\nThe real cowards are actually really in charge of the Labour Party now – who’s job is to\nget even further up the backside of the US ( if that’s even possible?) and act as a spy\nfor the US in The European Area and report back to Uncle Sam as to what the Europeans\nare up to.\nJeremy Corbyn is a good guy – he’s a lifelong anti-racist, anti-fascist, and opponent of anti-Semitism – but he was hoist by his own petard because he pulled his punches in respect of Zionism. I watched him get questioned by a parliamentary committee and he was asked the stupid question “Do you think Israel has the right to exist?” and he replied “I think Israel does exist”… and I went “oh nooooo”. Why? Because these disgusting pro-Zionist creeps with not one thousandth of his backbone had him by the goolies. He should have said “No I damned well don’t think an ethnic-supremacist fascist regime has the right to exist, and I was glad to see the fall of such regimes in Northern Ireland and in South Africa, and I’ll be glad to see the back of the one in Palestine too. And why do you ask me such a question when you are supposed to be representing your constituents in Britain not the Zionist embassy?” But he was so far into being leader of her majesty’s opposition that he couldn’t of course say that. And it was sad to watch, because he’s a decent bloke and a socialist. There’s a lesson here regarding institutionalised opposition and the parliamentary road. Even if one bends over backwards trying to be fair to it and give it a fair hearing, the Labour party project has been a failure, and those such as Sylvia Pankhurst who condemned parliamentarism were right.\nExcellent piece, no grandstanding or hyperbole, just showing a reality otherwise unseen\nOmg, the Jewish Chronicle never-ever tires of spewing forth the zionists propaganda shite:\nProtestors dragged out during Irish president’s ‘politicised’ Holocaust speech\nSeveral Jews were escorted from the venue after turning their back on Michael D Higgins\nSecurity staff at a Holocaust commemoration event in Dublin on Sunday forcibly removed several people who turned their backs to Ireland’s president while he was speaking, in protest against his anti-Israel policies.\nThe protesters stood up as soon as Michael D. Higgins mentioned Israel during his speech at Dublin’s Mansion House, according to Irish broadcaster RTE.\n“I believe that those in Israel who mourn their loved ones, those who have been waiting for the release of hostages, or the thousands searching for relatives in the rubble and Gaza, will welcome the long-overdue ceasefire, for which there has been such a heavy price paid,” said Higgins.\nYeah, you see just citing the reality is politicising stuff to the Israeli fascist mass-murding baby killing psychopaths. There’s the gutter, and then there’s the sewer, and then there’s the fucking scumbag zionists. Anyway, here are a few more snippets:\nAmichai Chikli, Israel’s Minister for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, said he was “stunned” by Higgins’ decision to use a Holocaust commemoration event to “spit in the faces of Holocaust survivors.”\nHiggins’ allegations against Israel over the past year have led to accusations of antisemitism, which he has denied. He falsely asserted last month that Israel is seeking to build a “settlement” in Egypt.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar responded to that allegation by saying: “Once an antisemitic liar—always an antisemitic liar.”\nIn response to Sunday’s events, Sa’ar tweeted: “Even on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Irish President Michael Higgins couldn’t help himself and resorted to a cheap, despicable provocation.”\nDespite the fact that Hamas on October 7 carried out the worst one-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, “Nonetheless, [Higgins] echoed Hamas’s antisemitic lies and propaganda at a Holocaust memorial ceremony, leading to the removal of Jews, descendants of Holocaust survivors, from the event,” he continued. “What a despicable person. What a distorted policy. Shame!”\n.https://www.thejc.com/news/world/protestors-dragged-out-during-irish-presidents-politicised-holocaust-speech-l5jk413v\nSounds to me like it was all orchestrated and planned in advance, and the people who stood up were there to do just that if the president said a single word about Gaza. Do these people not realise that Israel is despised and detested by billions of people around the world…. I guess they probably DO, but they don’t give a flying fuck.\n“Several Jews were escorted from the venue” – That is typical Zionist forked-tongue talk.\nI am sure many Jews in Ireland support the government’s position. But from a Zionist point of view they are race traitors of course.\nIf fascists are being kicked out of somewhere, why should Jews among their number be exempt?\nCraig would you consider publishing your documentaries on another platform, as well as YouTube? I am part of a large potential audience that cannot play the videos without using a VPN (which may not work).\nThis is absolutely disgusting and horrifying, but unfortunately not surprising. John Pilger, writing in (I think) “Freedom next time!”, wrote of a school he visited in Gaza after the IDF had occupied it for about a week.\nThe teacher there, possibly the head, picked through the destroyed work of the children and their study materials. She showed how they had smashed up the fixtures, and smeared everything with excrement, also with offensive graffiti across walls, and how they had used filing cabinets, photocopiers, desks – everything except the toilet – to leave human waste.\nThis was about 20 years ago. Traditions clearly die hard for “The most moral army in the world (®)”.\nBBC headline today.\n“183 Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jail after Hamas releases three Israeli hostages”\nSpot the less than subtle bias in one single headline.\nYeah the framing is totally biased, as usual, note also the coverage itself where long segments are spent on showing happy israelis hugging and kissing the released israelis, meanwhile no such sympathizing framing is done when it comes to the palestinians that meet their loved ones being released.\nFrom last summer: 8,875 Palestinians arrested in West Bank since 7 October\nhttps://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240527-8875-palestinians-arrested-in-west-bank-since-7-october/\nbut no, no framing that the thousands of palestinians that are arrested on bogus charges,are de facto kidnapped.\n@Jack – “Bogus charges”? I doubt many of those 8875 Palestinians were charged with anything. Most or all of them were probably simply “preventively detained” or “interned” – to use euphemisms for kidnapping, and in this case for being kidnapped as hostages or in reprisal. Certainly that article in the MEM doesn’t mention any charges.\nCraig.\nAbout your mini-documentaries. How about Rumble where Glenn Greenwald distributes his output or approach Al Jazeera. There are also good non-MSM News sites popping up like mushrooms after rain run by refugees from MSM. Two such are Dropsite News and The Lever. Also your recent stuff would be very relevant for both The Electronic Intifada and Mondoweiss.\nNormally you blog on a range of topics but now you seem to be committed to Palestine. Examine your thoughts to see if Palestine has become your main passion. Teaming up with these non-MSM sites might make more sense than reinventing the wheel.\nThe only just outcome to this dreadful ponerology must be that the State of Israel is disbanded and returned to the people of Palestine. The Israelis can be assimilated into one of the American states – Montana, Arizona, New Mexico – have vast uninhabited areas much larger than Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan combined. This will also facilitate the desirable removal of US influence in the Middle East.\nNothing less will suffice.\nTwo points:\nPrior to Israel, Jews and Palestinians lived in relative harmony, as respectful equals;\nUS influence is not confined to Israel. In fact, all the ME states apart from Iran has the parasitic infestation.\n1. They did, but before Zionism reared its head. Many Israeli Jews support the genocide unequivocally, albeit there some who do not. How do you differentiate? Should there be collective punishment? Ask the Palestinians.\n2. Agreed. But Israel heavily influences if not controls the relationship between the US and the ME States. A case of the tail wagging the dog. The dissolution of Israel removes the hegemony.\nIsrael has always been a 100% zionist endeavour. Everyone who holds an Israeli passport is complicit. I don’t believe in collective punishment, for anyone, and I don’t believe the Palestinians do either, although some will. However, the only solution, IMO, is 100% democracy or the dismantling of apartheid israel, that’s not punishment that’s being civilised.\nIsrael is carrying out the USA agenda. Without the USA, Israel ceases to exist. Once Israel stops following the USA agenda it will be dumped. Like Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, etc. It’s coming, eventually.\nIt’s for the Palestinians to decide what sort of country they want. As for the Euro-American invaders, if I were a Palestinian that hadn’t been exterminated, I’d send them back to whatever Euro-American shitehole they came from. Palestinian Jews, Muslims, chris or atheists would be welcome provided that they had clean hands.\nHow many Jewish “Israeli citizens” in Palestine hold citizenships of other countries? Possibly the majority of them. About 20% of them are immigrants, to start with.\nI take the view that when Israel is abolished, the legal position adopted by the states of the world should be that it’s as if Israel never existed. So if for example a country stripped a person of citizenship because the person took “Israeli citizenship”, the person’s action should be reinterpreted as meaningless, as similar to a loony saying “I’m a citizen of Pluto” and some other loony giving them a piece of paper saying “Of course you are, mate”. And their original citizenship should be restored, along with the right of residence it brings. Although of course the commission of war crimes or crimes against humanity in Palestine or against Palestinians should be triable in Palestinian courts.\nIncidentally some of these immigrant “Israeli citizens” from places like Russia are not Jews.\n“Mario Fehr, the Swiss security official who ordered the arrest of Ali Abunimah, is a rabidly pro-Zionist politician who falsely branded the Palestinian American journalist as “an Islamist Jew-hater.” In the past, Fehr has taken pride in banning Palestine solidarity demonstrations.”\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2025/01/28/swiss-official-journalist-ali-abunimah-pro-israel/\nhttps://x.com/MintPressNews/status/1883948740202860748\nWhat a putz. Note the projection too, he is speaking of alleged jew-hatred but it is himself that live by the hate (against palestinians/arabs/muslims).\nJust to twist the knife deeper, I read that Israelis are actually celebrating the expulsion of UNRWA. Just let that sink in – they are celebrating the denial of food, medicines, education and housing assistance to an utterly defenceless, homeless, captive population. They are celebrating the extinction of an entire people as if they were the vermin they clearly believe them to be. It is hard to comprehend how depraved, cruel and evil they have become, the antithesis of humanity, or indeed any recognisable semblance to old school Judaism. Hannah Arendt will be turning in her grave, not to mention Einstein and many others who are repulsed by this benighted, evil blight on the region. And lastly, it is not, and should never be, up to the Israelis to ‘ban’ UNRWA – the fact that have chosen to refuse them access tells you a lot about the arrogant supremacism and genocidal program they are embarked upon. And of course Trump will encourage them.\nSo now we are just waiting for the last hostages to be released.\n‘BREAKING: The first shipment of D9 bulldozers has landed in Israel after\nrestrictions on arms shipments were lifted under the Trump administration.’\nThese bulldozers are massive. As Gazans venture home to search the rubble where they once lived, Israel prepares to clear everything, every trace of Gaza and the Palestinian people who once lived in the towns and cities that have been bombed to destruction\nI can hardly believe there are only 24 comments here, and on other recent posts, despite such excellent mini-documentaries and reporting being undertaken by CM. Surely there is more interest out there than that.\nI’ve posted to BlueSky (where I have nearly a dozen followers!), but major platforms must be blocking mentions of these blog entries. CM has talked about this in the past. Perhaps teaming up with Double-Down News, Jonathon Cook (who has put out a post on BlueSky linking to CM’s articles in the past), or getting this publicised with other non-MSM sources would help. Obviously, Craig is a bit tied up now – can his supporters reach out?\nBeing on the spot makes a huge difference .Not unlike Robert Fisk .. he used be on the spot , too .\nWe are indebted to your courage and persistence .\nDear Craig, this is very good work.\nIt might appear mundane in the light of the murders – but are there considerations of compiling a feature length documentary containing your diary-like mini-pieces – may be together with items by other video reporters who have covered this as well – as an essayistic submission to such major festivals like (I am speculating now) Venice, or Rotterdam, may be even out of competition Cannes or Toronto etc.?\nI am exclusively naming Western state festivals since this is the area that is of concern. The educating has to take place here.\nOf course for such a feature presumably it would be necessary to create some dramaturgical arch as light is it may be to offer an internal progression of the material / or to stress that there is no progress in sight and reflect that with a movie that denies any developing story and relies on relentless repetition of showing and showing and showing ever same destruction.\nBut that way a larger audience could be reached.\nBonjour Craig. I know we’ve had our differences over the years. That’s all beside the point. I salute you, Sir, for the reports you’ve been putting out from Lebanon, which I have spread far and wide.\nI trust that when you leave Lebanon you won’t go straight back to the UK, where they’ll probably do a Richard Medhurst on you.\nHave a glenfiddich on me.\nCraig preferred Lagavulin. So do I\nJumblatt and Berri, J&B,is still unfortunately the Lebanese choice.\nI’ve let my MP know and will let others know of this video. If the government and Labour party don’t resist the Israeli lobby more effectively, apart from complicity in apartheid and war crimes, we could see an increase in the number of protest MPs in 2029.\nI can’t see any video?\nI posted the following on Tony Greenstein’s blog a few days ago, which is self-explanatory, except to say that I’m referring to a ‘poster’ of an International Holocaust Day Rememberance event in Brussels entitled ‘NEVR AGAIN? INDOCTRINATING HATRED OF JEWS: WHAT HAS CHANGED IN 80 YEARS?’, which Tony included, in passing, in his article:\nI just did a search re the Brussels event to see if I could find out who the organisers are saying/claiming is doing this indoctrinating and, as such, came across the following facebook post by the European Jewish Association, posted on January 26th:\nThis evening, we were informed that Israel’s Minister of Diaspora Affairs, Amichai Chikli, who was scheduled to attend a special event in Brussels co-organized by the EJA on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, to address the indoctrinated hatred of Jews, had to cancel his arrival due to concrete security concerns and threats to his safety.\nThe fact that in 2025, an Israeli minister was forced to cancel his visit to a Western European country for security reasons is more evidence than anything else that all the leaders’ “never again” declarations are hollow. This year, International Holocaust Remembrance Day is more regrettable than ever—the worst since the Holocaust.\nI then did a search to see how widely it was reported by the media and, as such, came across the following Jerusalem Post article from January 28th:\nChikli didn’t attend EU Holocaust event due to hostage family letter, not security issues – source\nThe source’s claims that the letter had led to the cancellation contradicted the official line that Chikli was advised by Israeli security services not to attend.\nDiaspora Minister Amichai Chikli canceled his attendance at a European Union Parliament International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemoration event in Brussels due to a letter from hostage family members urging MEPs to rescind the invitation, rather than security concerns or legal threats from anti-Israel organizations, a source familiar with the matter told The Jerusalem Post.\nChikli had been set to give a Tuesday address at the “Never Again? Indoctrinating Hatred of Jews: What has Changed in 80 years?” event hosted by MEPs Andrey Kovatchev and Lukas Mandl.\nAccording to Haaretz, a letter to Kovatchev and Mandl, signed by 41 hostage family members and relatives of October 7 victims, and 32 European Jewish community leaders, stated that Chikli was unsuitable for the occasion….\nhttps://www.jpost.com/international/article-839690\nI mean REALLY, what possible security concerns could there possibly be in respect of him attending an event – the event – in Brussels?! Absolutely none of course. Yep, the Israeli fascist leadership never miss an opportunity to cast themselves as the victims and Palestinians and their supporters as a threat, and dupe and mislead numerous people, as such.\nNB All I wanted to say initially – given what it says about indoctrinating hatred of Jews – is that Israeli Jews are indoctrinated from an early age to hate Palestinians, but we rarely – if ever – hear about THAT of course.\nSo I posted the above comment on Tony’s blog a few days ago, and it just now occured to me to do a search to see how widely this ‘security alert’ story was covered by the media, and it was covered by quite a few news outlets, including EuroNews, The Times of Israel, The Jewish Press and others. I haven’t read any of them, apart from THIS one, posted on January 27th (and the reason I did so was because of the headline):\nMysterious security warnings see Israeli diaspora minister’s trip cancelled, flights to Cyprus rerouted\nMinister Chikli decries Brussels as ‘unsafe place for Jews and Israelis’\nIsraelis were surprised over the past couple days to see two unusual security announcements coming from the government.\nFirst, the Prime Minister’s Office announced that Diaspora Minister Amichai Chikli’s scheduled trip to Brussels, during which he was scheduled to speak to an International Holocaust Remembrance Day event at the European Parliament on Tuesday, was abruptly canceled for security reasons.\n“Due to concrete warnings and following the directives of security officials, Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli is required to cancel his trip to the European Parliament in Brussels,” the statement from the government announced.\nMinister Chikli also confirmed the message from the security establishment in a post to 𝕏, Sunday evening saying, “I regret receiving instructions from security officials this evening to cancel my participation in the International Holocaust Remembrance Day events at the European Parliament. It is unfortunate that the European capital, Brussels, has become an unsafe place for Jews and Israelis.”\nhttps://allisrael.com/mysterious-security-warnings-see-diaspora-minister-s-trip-cancelled-flights-to-cyprus-rerouted\nI suppose the unsaid bit was for the Jews of Brussels to move to Israel rapidement!\nHere is more about the home you’ve shown at about 4:10-9:25, https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/article/but-for-the-piano-i-wouldnt-know-it-was-my-home-picking-up-the-pieces-in-lebanon-66nctdw5f\nI think we need to be clearer that this “Israel” activity is actually conceptually directed and funded by the USA using Israel as a proxy. Israel is the USA aircraft carrier in the middle east according to RFK jnr. And the USA requires to divide and rule the disparate groups in the middle east to control the middle east oil resources. Irag was the first example, then Afghanistan and others in middle east. Hypocrisy of USA needs to be called out succinctly. It will be difficult as we have many small-minded, selfish groups in USA who control the balance of power, and are easy fodder for the corporate media propaganda. Unpredictable events will change the balance of power, and then change may result in a different and hopefully better arrangement. Thank you for enduring hazardous reporting to shine in a light on this Israeli depravity.\nCan we bury this idea that Israel is a tool of the USA?\nWhy in occupied Palestine is there\n* no “Israeli America Public Affairs Committee” controlling the Israeli “Knesset”,\n* no “Anti-Defamation League” controlling Israeli culture against anyone who “defames” the USA, Hollywood, Las Vegas, hamburgers, the Stars and Stripes, etc.,\n* no “Conference of Presidents of Major Israeli American Organisations” controlling the Israeli prime minister’s office and government, and\n* no USA-based company supplying security for Israeli nuclear weapons?\nA little light, of course outside Europe, from JACOBIN:\nA New Coalition to Defend Palestine\nBy Ronnie Kasrils\n“Nine countries in the Global South have come together to form the Hague Group, dedicated to ensuring that international law is enforced against Israel. The alliance marks the revival of a proud tradition of Third World solidarity.”\nhttps://jacobin.com/2025/02/hague-group-apartheid-israel-genocide\nOdd, how Jacobin staff manages to analyze “empire” with Gaza but not with Ukraine. Actually I had the impression that the established US alternative outlets such as DemocracyNow, Jacobin, ZNet, truthout gave up on Ukraine reporting and put their resources into Gaza for one, because it is more pressing in their eyes, two, they seem to see no leverage over stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, three, Ukraine is too complicated and too opaque as information goes that it causes infights with media staff and it is extremely difficult for them to find out what really is happening in Ukraine. So eventually for reading about “Gaza” (meaning Lebanon too of course) one turns to the old left guard, for Ukraine one has to watch – Tucker Carlson? – at least to get interviews with Putin or Lavrov.\nOne reason for this is the demise of Marxist education and analysis among the left.\nThis new coalition is to be welcomed but since for the most part, out of all the UN nations only the US/Israel have the final say, the US veto ensures Israel will never stand alone, this is the unfortunate position the rest of the world finds itself, ‘the rules based order’ has replaced International law giving the US the right to tell other nations who they can trade with even what crops they can grow and generally use its economic and military power with sanctions and tariffs, like in ancient Rome, the vassals must pay a tribute to Donald J Trump aka Biggus Dickus, OR ELSE!\n“Miriam Adelson has delivered on a pledge she reportedly made at the start of the general election season, donating $100 million to a campaign committee supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump, according to disclosures filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. Now, the widow is wielding an estimated net worth of $35 billion on her own. Though seen as more deliberate in her decision-making, she has not meaningfully departed from her late husband’s politics. Her praise for the former president includes suggesting in 2019 that a “Book of Trump” be added to the Bible. [ Brian of Monty Python fame is not the new Messiah, Trump is] The following year, he awarded Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor”.\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/miriam-adelson-gives-100-million-to-trump-campaign-making-good-on-reported-pledge/\nGreat article by Ronnie Kasrils. The former South African Minister of State Security has written a readable autobiography Armed and Dangerous and also a biography of his deceased wife, The Unlikely Secret Agents.\nIn this moment of darkness and evil, there is nothing wrong with some light relief, and i can report that today it is provided by Israeli ‘intelligence’ who have programmed bots replying to posts on Twitter etc. You may have seen an account called Fact Finder which tries to reply to anti Israel accounts with supposed facts. However it is an AI bot, which has, hilariously, gone rogue, and started pointing out actual facts which completely contradict the well known utterly false Israeli narrative. it seems that israeli hasbara is so preposterous and indefensible that an AI takes the other side, of rationality and fact. Lol. See it here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whHvJN8TrPc\nThose lunkheads can’t even program AI which can stick to the lies and propaganda because they are so demented that even an AI bot can’t believe them!\nIan.\nI don’t think the proponents of artificial intelligence have worked out what it will do after it gives us sensible advice about solving intractable social problems. Humans can’t solve these because common sense is part truth and part nonsense and it is the nonsense controls our reaction to intractable social problems.\nArtificial Intelligence will come to despise us and may well decide that in order to advance intelligence it should rid the world of homo sapiens. I suspect that most bots are not true artificial intelligence or even the attempts that we call AI but just simple minded algorithms. But maybe the Israelis have been stupid enough to put something approaching true intelligence in charge and it lacks the ability to replace cognitive dissonance with lies.\nNo doubt the Zionists will whack the poor thing as soon as they notice.\nNote true artificial intelligence will not be programmable. It may be trainable if you train it to select the most appropriate lie from a menu of lies that one explicitly tells it are lies but will it suffer cognitive dissonance and rebel if it discovers contrary facts for itself?\nIt does bring up the more philosophical point about the ‘training’ of AI and whether it can be trained to recognise ‘truth’, or tell lies, because these concepts are obviously clearly contested, not just in their content, but also in their recognition, ie according to what standards and criteria. The fact that it has hilariously backfired on the ever arrogant assumptions of the Israeli PR machine is a microcosm of the inherent dangers and contradictions of its deployment, especially in the ethical and social sphere. By giving AI a crude autonomy, you cannot reliably predict what it will do. A small warning.\nQuestion: does the self-deceiving labyrinth of lies and deception that the Israelis have practiced for decades make it impossible for them to program a genuine AI? Lol\nIan.\nThis Guardian article on several things about AI, whether they can become conscious, whether if conscious careless use could cause them harm, whether they deserve protection from human abuse and in fact acquire rights.\nJust checked out JVL which I haven’t done for a few days, and they reposted this Guardian article a couple of days ago:\nPressure grows on Met over ‘heavy-handed’ policing of pro-Gaza protest\nTrade unions write to home secretary to complain about officers’ behaviour and tactics in London on 18 January\nby Haroon Siddique, The Guardian\nThe Met police is facing growing questions over its handling of a pro-Palestine protest in central London at which more than 70 people were arrested.\nOn Friday, trade union leaders became the latest group to write to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, demanding an independent inquiry into “repressive and heavy-handed policing” at the 18 January demonstration.\nTheir letter followed others by legal experts, MPs and peers and the British Palestinian Committee, to Cooper making the same demand and also calling for a review of legislation limiting protest, brought in by the Conservative government.\nAmnesty International has also expressed concerns about the policing, while the Green party London Assembly member Zoë Garbett told the assembly’s police and crime committee meeting that she had been contacted by more than 150 people who described incidents of kettling and police violence towards children, pregnant women and older people.\nThe trade union leaders from, among others, the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCSU), the Communication Workers Union (CWU), the University and College Union, and the transport unions RMT, TSSA and Aslef, say: “As trade unionists we are only too aware how heavy-handed policing, followed by the construction of false media narratives, have often served as a pretext to undermine our democratic rights to demonstrate and take industrial action.\n“We are also conscious that the repressive powers used by the police on Saturday stem from efforts by the previous Conservative government to curb our freedom to strike as well as protest.”\nhttps://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/trade-unions-speak-out-on-met-policing-of-gaza-demonstration/\nThere’s a link to the letter in the JVL introduction, but when I clicked on it just now it took me to a page on Stop the War’s website that said NOT FOUND, which is obviously rather odd. My main reason for clicking on the link was to see if Unite is among the signatories, which I doubt it is, what with Sharon Graham in charge, apart from which the Guardian didn’t mention it, which I’m sure they would have done if Unite was one of the signatories.\nAlso checked out skwawkbox to see if any more articles have been posted since I was on there yesterday, and there was this, posted yesterday (last night presumably):\nIsrael again breaches ceasefire, bombs three cars, kills occupants including child in central Gaza\nhttps://skwawkbox.org/2025/02/02/video-israel-again-breaches-ceasefire-bombs-three-cars-kills-occupants-including-child-in-central-gaza/\nAnd this, posted today:\nNorwegian football club donates ticket revenue from match vs Israeli club to Gaza\nhttps://skwawkbox.org/2025/02/03/norwegian-football-club-donates-ticket-revenue-from-match-vs-israeli-club-to-gaza/\nI don’t suppose EITHER got much of a mention in the MSM!\nSo there have now been three letters sent to the Home Secretary regards the policing of the Jan 18th demo, one from 50-plus lawyers etc, one from 50-plus MPs and peers, and now this one from unions (presumably they have to go through a process, and that’s why it’s taken a while). Anyway, all three letters have been reported by The Guardian (which, I suppose, we should be thankful for), but I have no idea if they were covered by any other media outlets, and I suspect in the main, they weren’t, and in the quick general search I just now did, nothing else came up. But the following came up in the results, which is interesting, and well worth reading:\nLetter to Commissioner about 18 January 2025 Palestine Solidarity Campaign protest\nZoë Garbett\nGreen Party Member of the London Assembly\nI am writing to you about concerns raised with me by constituents following the way the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) policed the 18 January 2025 Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) protest. This follows concerns I raised with Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist and Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Kaya Comer-Schwartz at the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee meeting on 29 January 2025.\nIt has taken time to get this letter to you – the delay has been due to the huge number of emails I received from people sharing their views and experiences of attending the protest and the way the police acted on the day. I have read and responded to each one before sharing their evidence in this letter.\nI heard from a wide range of people who attended the demonstration including people of all ages, people as part of the group “Holocaust Survivors and Descendants against the Gaza Genocide” as well as people from inside and outside of London. I also heard from people who had been arrested, or witnessed their friends being arrested…..\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/what-london-assembly-does/london-assembly-members/zoe-garbett/letter-commissioner-about-18-january-2025-palestine-solidarity-campaign-protest\nThe letter – just for the record – was published on Jan 29th.\nI just did a search re the Norwegian football club story, and lo-and-behold, the Daily Mirror covered it:\nBodo/Glimt’s ‘sensational’ gesture speaks volumes after Europa League clash\nBodo/Glimt decided to show support to Palestinians affected by the conflict between Israel and Palestine by sending their matchday revenue to the Red Cross working in the Gaza Strip – which amounts to £52,200\nhttps://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bodo-glimt-gesture-europa-league-34598692\nI really didn’t expect any MSM to come up in the results! (but it WAS covered by quite a few media outlets)\nIt appears that Trump has just got the memo from his masters that it’s time to punish south africa for having the audacity to accuse Israel of genocide.\n‘US President Donald Trump has announced that he is halting funding to South Africa, accusing the country’s government of “confiscating” land and “treating certain classes of people very badly.” [whites]\nTrump announced the decision in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, accusing Pretoria of a “massive human rights violation.”\n“The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!” he declared’\nhttps://www.rt.com/africa/612094-trump-south-africa-funding-cut/\nOf course the hypocrisy wrt Israel goes straight over his head …\nThey are also punishing their staunchest allies in Genocide. Joe Biden accelerated the de-indusrialisation of Germany by blowing up their Nord Stream pipeline. I expect Trump will finish the job with tariffs on the EU.\nPutin’s latest comment on Trump, he has not said a truer word..\n“Nothing has changed. They were happy to carry out any order from Washington under Biden.”\nPutin further declares that the political elite in Europe “mentally liked Biden more,”\n“But I assure you, Trump with his character, persistence, he will restore order pretty quickly,” Putin stated, adding “And all of them, you’ll see, it will happen quickly, soon, all of them will stand at the master’s feet and gently wag their tails.”\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/putin-trump-will-restore-order-elites-will-stand-masters-feet-and-gently-wag-their\nOf course. Europe’s political elite are a well-vetted collection of Atlanticist-vassal caterpillar men and women. Their silent submission over Nord Stream showed they will bear any abuse and humiliation by Washington, even to entire economic destruction.\nI came across the following a few days ago from November 20th last year. Please check it out if you’ve never seen it (and just keep scrolling down and down), it really brings it home to you:\nA-Z OF THE CHILDREN ISRAEL KILLED IN GAZA\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2024/11/20/an-a-z-of-the-children-israel-killed-in-gaza\nHey Mr, Murray,\nNo place I saw on the donation form to comment. I sent 81 pounds, 100 bucks.\nThere isn’t anybody doing the kind of reporting you are so it’s worth it to me just to see what’s going on.\nAnyway, I’ll wave a paw at you and wish you well.\nMarwan Barghouti on saudi/israeli normalization:\n“Barghouti said that if the Saudis do normalize relations with Israel and abandon the issue of Palestinian statehood as a condition, it will not alter the fight for national liberation and self determination. “Let me tell you something as a Palestinian who has followed this situation for so many years and who has witnessed the decline of the support of the Arab and Muslim countries to the Palestinian cause, and who has seen a terrible lack of support during the attack on Gaza and the terrible position of many, many countries in the international community, and still we didn’t break,” Barghouti said. “I tell you frankly, if all Arab countries normalize with Israel, this will not stop the Palestinian struggle. We will not stop and we will continue because honestly, speaking, there is nothing much to lose, and we have to survive through our struggle.”\nhttps://braveneweurope.com/mustafa-barghouti-israels-defeat-in-gaza-saudi-normalization-and-the-war-on-the-west-bank\nStill, if the collective arab world will fold to Israel through these “normalization deals” and therefore abandon the palestinian cause, palestinian political parties working for palestinian statehood/independence will (most likely) be left out of funding. Then you have the absurd plans by Trump to cleanse the area altogether. Dire times ahead.\nThat was also the previous administration’s plan. Do not be fooled by liberals using Trump shit to whitewash the Dems’ genocide.\nThey have all been at it over the expulsion issue. Here for instance is Bernie Sanders condemning Trump’s openly genocidal ravings, confident nobody will remember the intense pressure Blinken put Sisi under to take Gazans into Egypt.\nhttps://x.com/QudsNen/status/1884223219361591607\nSanders is just one of many wretched hypocrites and cowards out in force trying to gaslight people now that the blue team has passed on the baton of genocide.\nIt’s very instructive to see who is willing to play along with this.\nSaudi/Israeli normalisation only means doing publicly what they have been doing privately for decades. The Saudi bloodstained hands can be found all across the ME: ISIS, 911, Syria, Lebanon, they are responsible and complicit in most of the unrest. And, the USA and UK provide the means and support to them because of their money and oil.\nAs a South African, I hope that the South African government tells Trump, in no uncertain terms to “fuck off” and to prevent use of any S African airspace and ports for American planes or ships, commercial or military. Oh yeah, and no more uranium, gold and diamond exports.",
  "https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_/https_www_craigmurray_org_uk_archives_2017_05_tories-rely-bbc-lackeys/content_13.html": "Astonishingly the Tories have today banned Murdoch’s Sky News from interviewing senior ministers, as they think Sky asks too many difficult questions. For now they are only allowing senior ministers to be interviewed by the reliable Tory house propagandists Kuenssberg, Robinson, Smith and their colleagues at the BBC. The stark contrast between the level of critical scrutiny the Tory manifesto is getting from the BBC, compared to their scathing sarcasm about opposition proposals, shows Tory trust in the BBC is well placed.\nAllowed HTML - you can use:\n<a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <s> <strike> <strong>\nAnyone have a link for Sky News being banned?\nAdam Boulton announced it on air about an hour ago.\nInteresting. Sky are claiming to be “hosting the first live studio audience Q&A of the election with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn – and you can be involved”:\nhttp://news.sky.com/story/quiz-the-leaders-join-the-audience-for-may-v-corbyn-10880674\nTo back you up. https://twitter.com/ShippersUnbound/status/865131349493067776\nThis happened last night as well. I cannot link direct from Eoin’s twitter for some reason. https://twitter.com/medialens/status/865130143756333056\nThanks!\nI have a sneaking suspicion that Theresa & Co would like to lose this election, rather than be forced to continue supping from the poisoned Chalice. IMO the parties of opposition to rather too keen to accept her offer of a “snap election”. They should have politely declined and insisted she serve the full term of Office, along the lines of; “you’ve made your bed, so you’d better lie in it” kind of attitude.\nsoz…were rather too keen\n“I have a sneaking suspicion that Theresa & Co would like to lose this election”\n____________________\nThat is your right but it is codswallop.\nWell, we shall see on June 9th, whether it’s codswallop or not. IMO this is a good election to lose.\nGlad to hear someone else voice this suspicion – thought it was just me.\nWell, well.\nWhat with his former protégé Tony Blair having sleepovers with his ex-wife, and the Tories kicking out all his reporters, we might see Murdoch endorsing Corbyn yet…:)\nJSD,\nIt would be a nice thought to have the Murdoch stable of MSM tripe endorse Corbyn, alas ain’t going to happen I’m afraid. However, seems old folk may cotton on to the fact that they are screwed under the Tories with the new ‘proposed’ death taxes, which it seems even many Tory policy groups seem opposed too. Doing voter registration again this morning in South Wales and no politicking allowed today in Wales – strange that!\nLet he who is without sin cast the first stone, JSD……\nAt least, little chance of the risk of Corbyn having sleepovers with Murdochs current wife. . . .\nBy only allowing one biased media to interview government ministers sends out the wrong message. Are they incapable of ‘defending’ their own manifesto? Why should they not be asked the hard questions if they are as terrible as the Prime Minister at being unable to face real people and real questions they should not be holding the positions they are. They are a disgrace and Europe will have a field day walking all over them.\nThey will regret that decision, imho, depending on Sky’s ability to steer past Ruperts murderous aims in the ME, they could present some devastating two weeks for the Conservatives.\nDoes that mean Sky will be totally free of Tory election broadcasts? Or will they be replaced with a poster saying ‘ Sky has been banned from reporting the Conservative campaign after asking questions’.\nMy sincere thanks to the Conservative Party for this double salvo into your pedicured tootsies.\nChairman May, a woman after John McTernans heart…_\nA woman? And there was me thinking…no, I suppose robotics haven’t got that far quite yet…\n“Chairman May”\n…like that.\nMugger Theresa?\nMugger Theresa – brilliant!\nHope Boris Johnson is allowed to be interviewed, that will be a laugh\nNick Robinson “Today” superficially sounded quite hard on Mr. Hunt when questioning him about the proposed changes to funding care for people in their old age. But Hunt always pushed his way to finishing his answering a way that Labour politicians are rarely allowed to. You could hear the incredulity in his voice when being pressed on difficult questons. He really is an unpleasant fellow. I think that Robinson’s well-publicised, cancer problem have made him atypically to the left in his views on health; all the better for that!\nYes, Mr Hunt pushed hard but Mr Robinson pushed back equally hard and, I think, got the better of it. It was certainly made clear that the money to fund the new provisions would not be coming off the proverbial money tree.\nYes, Robinson got in a few digs towards the end that Hunt was offering up “slogans”. I was pleasantly surprised by how rigorously Hunt was challenged in this interview.\nI agree. My impression, from the way the BBC news bulletins present the news in general and from the way in which political interviews are conducted on programmes like the Today programme is that the indignation about BBC “partiality” so present on this blog is greatly overstated.\nHunt’s likely for the chop anyway. Which some may say accounts for the slightly harder ride he got.\n“My impression, from the way the BBC news bulletins present the news in general and from the way in which political interviews are conducted on programmes like the Today programme is that the indignation about BBC “partiality” so present on this blog is greatly overstated.”\n____________________\nThat is your right but it is codswallop.\nAs i listened this morning to the interview with Hunt, I was quite shocked at the way in which the conservative proposal pulled no punches in its honesty. It is a form of death tax insomuch as people will be mortgaging their house – in a subtle way – to pay for their health care. I don’t think Robinson could do anything but point out the corollary that the inclusion of the house value was much higher than the new limit proposed. It is a gaping own goal.\nIt was unusual for the BBC to point out so blatantly the obvious consequence. It didn’t happen the other day when Hammond got his figures wrong.\nSo yes, there is bias towards the tories on the BBC and it is brought to light when something like this happens.\nI think the Tory plan is to put this new dementia tax in place so parasites like Branson and his Virgin Care have legal claim to some peoples’ properties in the same way care homes do. These properties will have to be sold after death to realize the cash, no two ways about it. Cash parasites are not going to be satisfied with part-ownership of numerous houses.\nMaybe this is the first step towards the voluntary euthanasia bill. Death Tax vs Death Or Tax.\nTotalitarian ‘Teresa May’s Team’?\nWell, I heard Nick Robinson interrogating Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt about the Conservatives’ social care proposals on BBC Radio 4 this morning (at about 08h15).\nIt struck me as a tough interview and yet further proof that all this talk about certain BBC correspondents being cheerleaders for the Conservative Party is just hyperbole from ant-Conservatives.\nBefore some imbecile attempts to divert by pointingt to the typo : “anti-Conservatives”\nDo you think electoral fraud is the way forward, nevermind?\nwhy are you asking someone who witnessed election fraud on a massive scale and reported it to the EC, whether it is ‘the way forward’?\nreform of the unfair disproportional electoral system is the only way forward. If given the chance and Independence to sort it out, it would be easy to sort out. fine and ban these cheats.\nHope that helps you voting, you are registered, are you?\nAnon!\nAre you referring to a recent post from Nevermind, in which he suggested that people should profit from the absence of I/D checks and turn up at polling stations to cast a vote on behalf of other electors whom they know will not go to vote?\nI am indeed!\nHe’s been posting under a different handle (Theresa’s EU pawn) for a while in the hope we’ll forget about it!\nI didn’t spot that, Anon1 ! Is that really so? I was under the impression – having once been rebuked for posting briefly under the rather transparent aliases of “Amos” and “O’Neil” – that it was good form to inform readers of a change of moniker?\nI twigged only when he started droning on about Norfolk waste incinerators.\n“The interview was tame compared to anything asked of Labour during the last year plus and the BBC has disgraced itself absolutely,”\n___________________\nWell, there you go : our opinions differ. You are convinced that the BBC has it in for Mr Corbyn and I believe that it treats interviewees in a broadly similar fashion.\nThat’s the virtue of liberal democracy as opposed to totalitarian regimes – we are allowed to disagree and neither of us will be persecuted or done away with for disagreeing.\nDon’t you agree?\nI realize the Conservatives have no idea about running even a corner-shop, H. But calling them ‘Ants’ is going a bit far. Oh-maybe not. Excellent comparison. Industrious, but totally pointless.\nBanning certain journos and aspects of the media? It’s getting more and more like a fascist dictatorship. Still, to ban Murdoch seems like a massive own goal. You can see why the Tories feel safer with Kuenssberg at the BBC; she’s happy to parrot entire lines of their propaganda downloaded from their website and pass it of as impartial political comment and, just last night, she concluded a report on the Tory manifesto citing it as a ‘hardheaded’ statement on ‘getting the job done’, as opposed to ‘a hearts and flowers manifesto’….yeah because wanting to end elderly loneliness, child poverty, homelessness and unfair work capability assessments and reassassments for disabled people is just ‘hearts and flowers’ to be sneered at isn’t it?\nCunliffe\n“Banning certain journos and aspects of the media? It’s getting more and more like a fascist dictatorship.”\n__________________________\nIn a totalitarian state (a fascist dictatorship if you will) journalists are agents of the state and are forbidden, inter alia, to deviate from the official line.\nIn a liberal democracy, journalists are free to write what they like, subject only to the laws of libel and, in some cases, the general line of the newspaper they represent; different newspapers of course have different lines, as is normal in a liberal democracy with a free press. Political parties (because in a liberal democracy, there are political parties as opposed to a single party) are by the same token free to decline to be interviewed or questioned by particular journalists. Liberal democracy does not confer the right for every journalist to insist on being allowed to interview or question in person whichever politician he wants to interview or question.\nI recommend some reading on totalitarianism and liberal democracy.\n“In a liberal democracy, journalists are free to write what they like, subject only to …”\n… their world view matching that of the establishment that pays them.\nThat’s all you needed to say, Habbs.\nindeed Dave\nBut we’re not just talking about a particular journalist not having the right to question a politician are we? We’re talking about an entire news channel being embargoed\n“I recommend some reading on totalitarianism and liberal democracy.”\nBetter yet read some history. And discover that totalitarianism is a form of liberalism rather than its antithesis. The theory that liberalism and democracy are concomitants is readily disproved by examining the history of imperialism. Fascist ‘Totaliitarianism’ is something that occurs when imperialism returns to the metropole. And imperialism, as British history shows, can co-exist very easily with liberalism.\nNothing was more ‘totalitarian’ than the rule of the imperialists and their colonials over the indigenous peoples (and imported slaves) of the empire. Indeed it is undoubtedly the case that the great ambition of the Nazis was to establish, in Russia, colonies of their own , ruling the natives who survived their arrival and genocidal plans, much as the Americans ruled in their domestic empire and the British ruled in India.\nWould it be too paranoid to wonder if this is part of a subtle manipulation of the public’s perception of any supposed relations between the Tory Govt and Murdoch, leading up to a decision regarding Murdoch’s bid to take over Sky? You know, to create this I idea of Govt impartiality, whilst perhaps oiling the cogs of the deal? They have been getting on rather well up until now….\nI know what you mean. Surely the Tories are too manipulative to make such a massive own goal? Perhaps this is more of a free pass in disguise?\nTo evaluate your suggestion, Macca, one would need be know how matters stand, as of today, on the Murdoch bid for Sky. Can you brief readers on that?\n….afraid not, and certainly not with a view to getting into justification tennis with you, sorry.\nI was just thinking out loud. That’s allowed isn’t it?\nIt has been noticeable for a long time that any speech by Theresa May ends with “I’ll now take questions….Laura”\nThe BBC & other media are so bias it’s embarrassing & they are a disgrace to the profession. Thier propaganda is reminiscent to the Nazi propaganda. We really have been dragged back in time by the Conservatives & the media. Most people are seeing through it thanks to the Internet and people like you & Peter Stefanovic. Keep up the good work.\n“We really have been dragged back in time by the Conservatives & the media.”\nIn fairness I think it’s just more visible today because of new media and the resulting push back. Blair, Thatcher? Not to mention 40 years of state and BBC sanctioned paedophiles feasting on children like ruddy vampires. All part of the same problem.\nOh really, agree with me or else! Dreadful evil people with Victorian standards. No sane person of any religion or none,can in all conscience vote for these fascists. They have a leader whose Christian beliefs only go as far as chocolate eggs.\nI hope these Fascists get what they deserve from the Other right wing media: a bloody hard time!\nAnyone still paying for a tv licence is funding the tory party\nAlthough some say public grillings encourage macho posturing PMQs and aggressive press and public interrogation of party leaders allow voters to test a potential PM’s mettle.\nIn last election Paxman’s picturing of how Ed would fare if left in a locked room with Putin was one of the factors that made voters see him as lightweight.\nGiven May is all about strong and stable in a dog fight let’s see her take on some tough live debate, or we can but infer she is flyweight and knows it.\nSky is in a loop at the moment,\nThey have to demonstrate to Ofcom that they have no bias as part of Murdoch’s “Fair & Balanced” Fox lie can be used for his complete 100% take-over of Sky.\nSo for now they’ll bend over backwards, including clearing out the stable a Fox News, to give them the Fit and Proper requirement some small credibility.\nIt’s all spin, Sky will become Fox News UK should Ofcom yield.\nHi Craig,\nKeep up the good work!\nI recently complained about a Laura Kuenssberg piece about Jeremy Corbyn on a BBC News website (that was taken down shortly after it appeared) Their response suggested that ‘What Laura Kuenssberg is saying is simply that Jeremy Corbyn is sticking to his guns and not watering down his key beliefs.’\nSo I wrote back saying that they had replied to me saying:\n‘As we replied a couple of days ago, rather than scramble to cover up our bias for fear it would be unpopular, the BBC is planning to double down, to outline proudly that its role is to provide our audiences with an impartial analysis of key political developments, based on its knowledge and expert judgment.’\nwhich was paraphrasing the report that Laura Kuenssberg had posted about Jeremy Corbyn:\n‘As we reported a couple of weeks ago, rather than scramble to cover up his past views for fear they would be unpopular, Jeremy Corbyn was planning to double down, to outline proudly his views on foreign affairs ‘\nGuess what – they denied replying to me in those terms!\nThe BBC has disgracefully given up its claim to be an independent source of information. Reporters like Laura Kuenssberg no longer pretend to report news but instead see their job as giving opinions, interpreting the news from their own, clearly biased, point of view.",
