Money that is now being extracted by shareholders would be invested to fix the leaks and rebuild infrastructure. Public water companies must also ensure that abstraction respects nature.\nElected Greens will push to restore rivers and take a nature-based solutions approach to the prevention of flooding and storm overflows.\nWe would increase DEFRA’s budget by £1.5bn, allowing an increase in funding for the Environment Agency and Natural England, to support the vital work they do to protect our environment. This would include developing a soil health monitoring programme for England, to match those in Scotland and Wales, to assess and understand changes in the health of soil over time. This would end the flow of pollution into rivers and the sea from fertilisers, agricultural waste and sewage, through effective monitoring and enforcement.",
  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_can-britain-really-be-proud-of-its-climate-leadership/content_186.html": "John Hurst, Tunbridge Wells Green Party’s Parliamentary Candidate responds to Greg Clark’s column in last week’s edition of the Times of Tunbridge Wells.\n‘We hope everyone had a merry Christmas – even though it was wet, windy and one of the warmest on record.\nIn his last column, Greg Clark waxed lyrical about being at CoP28, his pride in Britain’s past climate leadership, and the government’s delivery of emissions reductions and environmental protection. While Greg indeed got Net Zero by 2050 approved in the last weeks of Theresa May’s premiership, the more pressing issue right now is keeping global temperature rises below 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels, as agreed by 196 countries at CoP21 in Paris in 2015; on current trends, 1.5degC may be exceeded by the end of this decade.\nAnd in that respect, Britain is showing anything BUT leadership.\nFirstly, the Government gave the go-ahead for the Cumbrian coal mine, which will produce 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gasses per year, equivalent to putting 200,000 cars on the road, thereby trashing any environmental reputation the UK might have had.\nIt recently approved development of the UK’s biggest oilfield, Rosebank, which Caroline Lucas has called ‘the greatest act of environmental vandalism in my lifetime’. The field could produce 300m barrels of oil in its lifetime, emitting as much CO2 as 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.\nThen the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars, and the phasing out of gas boilers, was pushed back by Rishi Sunak, a move met with despair by environmental experts, with former US vice-president Al Gore saying Rishi Sunak was ‘doing the wrong thing.’\nFriends of the Earth, Client Earth and the Good Law Project took the government to court in the summer over its inadequate future strategy for tackling climate change, following a damning progress report from the Climate Change Committee, which found there are only credible plans for less than a fifth of the emissions cuts needed to meet the UK’s legally binding climate targets.\nDoes this look like a government providing climate leadership?\nWorryingly, little has been done to bring the public along on the low-carbon journey. Britain has the worst insulated homes in Europe but there is no country-wide scheme to address this at a price people can afford and give them lower heating bills as well as cosier rooms.\nReplacement of gas boilers by heat pumps will need 45,000 extra skilled technicians, but there is no nationwide programme to meet those numbers. This is a government led by a PM who thinks the ‘free market’ is going to solve the climate emergency, but it isn’t – industry needs to see commitment and consistency from the Government before it will invest.\nAs one of the world’s richest countries, and the home of the Industrial Revolution, the UK needs to set an example by urgently moving away from fossil fuels, reducing heat losses from buildings, and investing faster in renewable energy. And the Prime Minister himself needs to lead by example – starting by dropping the use of private jets and helicopters for short journeys.\nWhen Britain has committed to a plan – and shown results – aimed at keeping short-term global temperatures under control, then we will have a chance of seeing White Christmases in Tunbridge Wells as regularly as we used to.’",

We don’t think the current Government is doing anywhere near enough, and we’re not at all sure that Labour will either. So if you really want hope for the future, and hope of real change, on the 4th July – Vote Green!’\nTransition to a decarbonised economy – from our 2024 Manifesto\nThe election is taking place against the background of a climate emergency. Since the last election, there have been an increasing number of days and months in which global temperature increases have breached 1.5 degrees Celsius, an increase that would make human life on earth unliveable.\nDespite commitments from the United Nations, national and local governments, corporations and individuals, greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. And our understanding of what this means is increasing too: we know that the social and economic impacts of climate breakdown are already being felt and will continue to be far worse than previously imagined.\nAs a political party, we believe in offering hope. And we believe in following the science and speaking the truth, too.\nOur manifesto sets out what we think is achievable given the failure of successive governments to prepare with anything like the urgency and ambition that climate scientists have been telling us is needed for decades.\nThe current UK commitment to net zero by 2050 fails to reflect that we can – and must – do so much more. That we can and must make the right political choices in order to transition at speed to a decarbonised economy. One that’s no longer in hock to the fossil fuel giants, but instead runs on clean, green and cheap renewables. An economy in which it’s cheaper to heat our homes, to get out and about and to run a business.\nAnd our manifesto sets out too how fairness can and must run through every part of the change that’s coming – from training the new workforce that will be needed to transform our economy, to investing in our vital public services, to lifting all of us up through a compassionate welfare system.\nThe solutions to the climate crisis are the same as those needed to end the cost of living and inequality crises, making the future not just more liveable but fairer for us all too. Throughout our manifesto, you’ll find examples of how climate action means better public services, warmer homes, stronger communities and a restored natural world.",

There won’t be a Green council after these elections but every Green vote sends a message to the Council that business as usual just won’t do.’\nPaul Froome, High Brooms: ‘I’ve lived in Tunbridge Wells for over 20 years and love it here. I enjoy being part of the strong community and there’s so much on offer, from theatres, a unique music venue, a huge variety of pubs, cafes, restaurants and shops, to wonderful open spaces. All our neighbouring boroughs have Green Party councillors pushing hard to create local jobs, make our homes more sustainable, champion social justice and protect the environment. I am standing as a Green Party candidate as I want Tunbridge Wells to benefit from the positive energy that Green Councillors are bringing across Kent. The traditional parties have let us down. Only the Green Party is committed to making the changes needed, in a fair way, to protect our environment and our children’s futures.’\nMaria Gavin: St James’: ‘I live in Southborough and I am a member of the Tunbridge Wells Friends of the Earth. I care about our local environment and worry about our changing climate. I want to help find ways to make it easier for people to live in a greener and more environmentally friendly way.’\nAdrian Thorne, St John’s: ‘I have lived and worked in Tunbridge Wells for over 20 years. I’ve been working with community groups to try and protect our local Green Belt and improve air quality near schools as well as picking up litter, chasing up traffic safety and trying to ensure the Council lives up to its promises on climate change. I want to be a fresh and independent voice on the Town Council.’\nKate Sergeant, Pantiles: ‘I have lived in the borough for over 20 years and have been campaigning locally on environmental issues since 2006. I love living here, between London and the coast, with access to so much countryside, history and culture. I work from home managing community support services for people living with dementia. I believe in the power of communities to make life better for everyone now and into the future. I am a passionate advocate for community energy – harnessing the power of renewable energy for the local community – and promoting better home insulation and retrofitting older homes to reduce our carbon footprint and help with fuel poverty. No one should have to choose between heating and eating.’\nFor a fairer, greener Tunbridge Wells – Vote Green!",

  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk/content_1.html": "Across the UK, Green councillors have successfully implemented policies that make real differences in people’s lives, whether it’s securing cleaner air, protecting community assets, or improving public services. Every Green vote strengthens the movement for positive change.\nOur aim is to get Green representation on Tunbridge Wells Borough Council and Kent County Council. Green councillors will push for real action on the environment, social justice, and local democracy challenging business-as-usual politics in Tunbridge Wells and Kent. Have a look at our local party manifesto below.\nThe Green Party is Growing\nIn May 2025, for the 8th year in a row we have grown our number of elected Greens across the country. We now have a total of 859 Green councillors on 181 councils including locally in Tonbridge & Malling, Maidstone and Wealden. A new record high. We also have 5 Greens on Kent County Council.\nIn 2024, a record-breaking General Election saw four Green MPs – Carla Denyer, Ellie Chowns, Siân Berry and Adrian Ramsay – elected to Parliament to deliver real hope and real change. We stood 18 candidates across Kent including our very own John Hurst here in Tunbridge Wells.\nNationally over 1.9 million people voted for us representing 7% of the vote which should have given us over 40 MPs in parliament. The current first-past-the-post system denied us that as it continued to serve the two big establishment parties. It’s time that changed.\nIn the borough elections here in Tunbridge Wells, we stood candidates in all 14 wards and with nearly 5,500 votes we sent a message saying there is a groundswell of support for a greener, fairer borough.\nJoin us and join the Green Party today!\nCan you spare some time? There are lots of campaigns and events to get involved with and it’s great meeting like-minded people.\nHave you joined the local party? Now’s the time, we’re a very friendly group.\nCan you donate to our campaign fund? Every pound helps us reach more people and grow the movement.\nClick on the link and get in touch!\nHelp us get Greens elected in Tunbridge Wells\nOUR LOCAL PARTY MANIFESTO\nProtecting the natural environment in Tunbridge Wells and the surrounding villages\nFor now and future generations: Tunbridge Wells and the surrounding villages are in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Beauty. This medieval landscape of wooded rolling hills studded with sandstone outcrops, small irregular-shaped fields, scattered farmsteads and ancient routeways are a huge draw to visitors, a basis for many livelihoods and locally produced food. In many ways, the natural environment is under attack and the Green Party will champion and protect this irreplaceable treasure.\nAction areas:\n- Protect our green spaces from encroaching development.\n- Promote habitats, rewilding, and biodiversity.\n- Support action for cleaner rivers and waterways\n- Take action creating wildflower verges, tackle litter, eradicate avoidable pesticide and herbicide use\nSustainable transport and safer roads\nSafe, sustainable travel: We need to develop an integrated approach to road planning, public transport and active travel that encourages people to exercise, and which reduces the impact of cars and other road traffic.\nAction areas:\n- Developing public transport networks in and around Tunbridge Wells with better rural bus services to the villages to reduce reliance on private cars; promote re-opening of railway lines where feasible.\n- Promoting infrastructure for sustainable transport, such as EV charging points, dedicated cycle lanes and advocating for EV buses.\n- Promoting safe and active travel: safer cycle paths and maintained footpaths; more pavements in villages and towns so people can walk safely.\n- Campaigning for speed control such as 20’s Plenty speed limit in built-up areas\n- Improving quality and value for money of road resurfacing and pothole repair\nJoined-up planning and housing policies\nNeed not greed: Tunbridge Wells faces a crisis of affordability, not a shortage of housing. Communities are landed with unwanted developments of expensive homes, some of which encroach on protected areas. Some of these developments are badly located and lack the necessary infrastructure. We need a joined-up approach to planning, development and housebuilding that addresses the crisis of affordability and protects the local countryside and communities.\nAction areas:\n- Challenging housing targets imposed by central government; and supporting the council, housing co-operatives and non-profits to provide affordable and appropriate housing.\n- Preventing development in protected AONBs and where there is insufficient access to public transport, amenities, and work.\n- Tackling the problem of affordability and empty homes, speculative “investment” homes and second homes\n- Enforcing sustainable standards for new builds, providing incentives for low energy housing and sustainable retrofits\nBuilding a sustainable ‘wellbeing economy’\nBeyond growth and business as usual: Our society can’t carry on with “business as usual”. We need to stop focusing on endless growth, which is unsustainable: we must prioritise wellbeing, jobs, and reducing carbon emissions and resource use.\nAction areas:\n- Promote wellbeing and green job creation, not endless economic “growth”; channel council spending power towards job creation, environmental sustainability and climate adaptation\n- Push for the County Council pension fund to speed up the programme of divestment from fossil fuels; and support local businesses to reach net zero by 2030\n- Promote ‘resource and circular economy centres’ to encourage reduction, re-use and recycling; encourage and support local Repair Cafes\n- Local energy cooperatives and sustainable generation encouraged\nFairness in education and social care\nInclusive, affordable services: Our focus will be on ensuring equitable access to services and taking a future-facing view. In health and social care, the emphasis will be on prevention; in education in developing training in the green economy.\nAction areas:\n- We will champion preventative care, making changes in support provision to enable more people to live safely and independently for longer.\n- We will seek to promote inclusive services, improve access for those with special educational needs, disabilities and all those who have been excluded\n- We will push for investment in young people’s futures, promoting school and training opportunities in the green jobs of the future and the social care sector\n- We will listen to service users, locals, and communities to make sure TWBC and KCC get it right; and we will push for better pay, status, training and management of social care workers\nPreparing Tunbridge Wells for climate shocks\nResilience and preparedness: How would Tunbridge Wells and the surrounding villages cope with a prolonged heatwave or drought? How well are we prepared for heavy rain and flooding? What can we do now to prepare for the impact of climate change? Tunbridge Wells Borough Council declared a climate emergency and now needs to increase ambition to reach zero carbon as soon as possible.\nAction areas:\n- We will campaign with enhanced urgency for local government to research, plan and prepare for an uncertain future, looking at the latest evidence best practice\n- We will encourage emergency preparedness structures in towns and villages\n- We will engage with researchers and experts to help farmers adapt and prepare\n- We will push for active preparedness for drought and flooding and other climate risks\n- We will seek to encourage local and community-focused horticulture and make food security a priority\n- We will encourage local farmers’ markets and produce sales to minimise food miles",

I was very proud to do that, but it was voluntary. What the Conservatives are proposing is to introduce some form of conscription, where you’d have to do some military service, or maybe get in the way of doctors and nurses at Pembury, while they try to look after patients. We don’t think that’s a good idea; and there’s so little money now for Local Authorities, that Kent County Council is thinking of cancelling the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award funding. Again, we’d restore that. And finally, we’re looking to get Britain back into the European Union, so that people, particularly young people, can study abroad and go and find a job – and learn what the world’s all about! So, for Real Hope, and for Real Change – on the 4th July Vote Green!’\nSupport not Conscription. Post-16, Further and Higher Education – from our 2024 Manifesto\nThe world of work is changing fast. Fewer young people will experience only one career and workplace in their lives. Education and training must be accessible, and better designed to support lifelong learning.\nGreen MPs will push for:\n• A £3bn increase in funding for sixth-form education over the next parliamentary term, and a £12bn investment in skills and lifelong learning for further education.\n• The restoration of the Education Maintenance Allowance to financially support young people to extend their studies after the age of 16.\nMarketisation has been disastrous for Higher Education, changing the relationships between students and academic faculty, pushing universities into financial crisis, and burdening a whole generation of students with debts so high that they are ruining their life chances.\nWe would fully fund every higher education student, restoring maintenance grants and scrapping undergraduate tuition fees. Our long term plans also include seeking to cancel the injustice of graduate debt.\nBritain’s Future In Europe\nThe Green Party is pro-European, and proudly so. We opposed UK withdrawal from the EU, and believe that Britain would be better off politically, socially, environmentally and economically had we maintained our EU membership. A united international response to global issues is needed now more than ever. Full membership of the EU remains the best option for the UK.\nGreen MPs will work towards:\n• Re-joining the EU as soon as the domestic political situation is favourable and EU member states are willing.\n• Joining the Customs Union as a first step towards full EU membership, and a way of resolving many of the worst problems resulting from Brexit.\n• A speedy return to the free movement of people between the UK and the EU, including reciprocal rights to work for both UK and European citizens.\n• Rejoining the Erasmus Programme, which enables students to study for a year in another European country.",

At the Examination in May, fellow Green Adrian Thorne and I pointed out that when it had become clear that the plan would result in 50% of new houses being in the Green Belt, they should have gone back to the drawing board.\nThe fateful decision to crash on with Tudeley despite the flashing red lights was taken in 2018 by the Conservative Cabinet led by David Jukes, who also championed the Calverley Square project – which could now have been a stalled construction site on Calverley Grounds, as the costs went through the roof, and the builder started making claims rather than progress.\nThe Local Plan has been referred back to TWBC to propose the way forward – will the Coalition now change direction and work to protect our green spaces, as their election literature promised to?\nThe Coalition hasn’t made any difference to local planning so far; the LibDems on the Planning Committee proposed and seconded the 8-storey monstrosity of an over-80’s Care Home on the Old Cinema Site, having failed to steer Council Officers to get the Developer to propose a more vibrant concept that would not dominate the Grade 2 listed buildings on the other three corners of the crossroads, and which would contain the affordable housing that people really need, and that the Local Plan promises.\nAfter twenty years of failed Conservative stewardship of the grot spot, the site will now see over a century of visual blight approved in the Coalition’s time. The Council has allowed the future of our town to be decided by Developers, not our elected representatives.\nTo top it all, a snap public consultation was held on a proposal to change the election system to “all outs” (once every four years), rather than the current system of “thirds” (a third of Councillors voted for every year), which was instrumental in 2019 in kicking out the advocates of the Calverley Square project. The “all outs” proposal was put to a Full Council meeting last month by Conservatives Tom Dawlings and Sean Holden, and with one exception, the Coalition members fell into line.\nWe responded in favour of retaining voting by thirds, as it strengthens the public’s ability to hold the Council to account.\nAs we have seen across Kent, the first Green on a Council makes all the difference – and next May is only six months away.\nMeanwhile we will have to prepare for the Old Cinema Site showing “The Bad, the Bad and the Ugly” every day for the foreseeable future; Tunbridge Wells deserves better than this.",
  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_a-fairer-and-greener-new-year/content_40.html": "We hope everyone had a good Christmas – even if their water had to be trucked into Tesco’s carpark for collection…\nWater played a big part in shaping a year that most people would like to put behind them, with lack of it causing wildfires in the hottest summer since 1976, followed by winter weeks of pouring rain, and then snow – but the snow didn’t stop our campaigning in December (see picture)!\nMeanwhile, TWBC produced a couple of chestnuts just before Christmas.\nFirstly, a Council meeting saw the LibDems lead rejection of the opportunity to change to “all-out” elections every four years, ignoring the public consultation’s 2:1 vote in favour – what happened to “listening”? This shut out the possibility of the Boundary Commission’s current review allowing some 1- and 2-seat Wards to be retained. As a result, illogical Ward splits are likely to be made in Southborough and around Goudhurst , Rusthall will be absorbed into Speldhurst, an arbitrary slice of Paddock Wood will go into Pembury, and large rural Wards will be cobbled together in the east.\nThen, a couple of weeks after Levelling Up and Housing Secretary Michael Gove announced new laws that make housing targets “an advisory and non-mandatory starting point” for planning, and not using the Green Belt, TWBC published its Initial Reaction to the Planning Inspector’s initial rejection of the concepts for Tudeley and Paddock Wood with a proposal for months of work to polish the flawed Local Plan, which puts 50% of new houses in the Green Belt – a recipe for more waste, and ultimate disappointment.\nWhilst many people will be glad to put 2022 behind them, there are reasons to be cheerful; for a start, neither Boris Johnson nor Liz Truss is Prime Minister any more, and the next General Election is coming closer.\nBut perhaps the most significant occurrence last year was the growing public awareness that things are not as they should be; there is a sense that our country is falling apart.\nBrexit, far from being the promised nirvana, has shrunk incomes and opportunities, and polls show majorities around 56% to 32% in favour of rejoining the EU. After twelve years of the “smaller-state” approach, starting with Con-Dem austerity, we see failures of privatisation in the NHS, the railways and throughout the water system – when the supply fails due to leaks, or when we have to choose carefully which beach to take the children to, in order to avoid sewage outfalls.\nThe Green Party has long believed that we need a fairer society and economy, as well as solutions for the climate and nature, if we are to thrive as a country, and the social and climatic events of 2022 have made that case even stronger.\nThere will be an opportunity for people to vote for change in May, when the local elections take place across sixteen Tunbridge Wells Wards.\nMeanwhile we send our Best Wishes to everyone for a fairer and Greener year in 2023.",

The annual subsidies started in 2012, under the Conservative/LibDem Coalition government, and will soon total £11billion.\nGreg lost his position as Business Secretary in the Brexit frenzy, but the current Energy Secretary Claire Countinho recently succumbed to the Drax lobbyists, and signed off on their plan to add unproven and complex carbon capture and storage to the wood-burning units. Analysts report that the likely £40billion (yes, that’s right, Forty Billion Pounds) it will cost will be paid for by domestic consumers’ energy bills.\n£40billion is about £600 for every person living in the UK, and tots up to £46million pounds for the 77,000 adult voters in Tunbridge Wells – comparable to half the cost of the rejected Calverley Square project, and adding to all our energy bills in due course.\nThe scale of the folly is breathtaking, as was the quiet way the Government slipped the news out under the radar screen.\nAcross Tunbridge Wells there are homeowners and community groups doing their best to preserve our trees and plant new ones – but all that comes to nought while we have a national Government that encourages the large-scale chopping down and burning of trees in Drax power station via massive public subsidies.\nThere is a General Election coming, and Times readers can help to stop this idiocy; ask any canvassers at your door what their Candidate plans to do with the Drax subsidies – and vote accordingly!",

He says’\n‘Everyone’s worried about the NHS, but the Green Party has a plan. We intend to introduce a fairer tax system where the richest 1%, that’s just the billionaires and multi-millionaires, will pay their fair share, and it won’t affect you and me.\nThat will make for a better NHS and a fairer Britain, and also help people who may be losing hope.\nSo for Real Hope, and Real Change, on 4th July – Vote Green!’\nTo offer Real Hope and Real Change for the NHS, Greens would:\nInvest £50 billion per year by 2030 into health and social care – more than any other major party – and would use the money to:\nDramatically reduce waiting lists;\nOffer everyone access to an NHS dentist;\nGuarantee urgent access to a GP and same day access for those in urgent need;\nInvest £5bn per year to boost NHS salaries and keep our wonderful nurses and doctors in the UK;\nInvest £20 billion per year into adult social care to ensure dignity for those in need of care and take pressure off the NHS;\nRestore public health budgets with a £1.5bn uplift in spending\nInvest £20bn in a capital investment to bring our crumbling hospitals and old equipment up to standard. We estimate that to meet these commitments, the NHS in England would require an additional annual expenditure of £30bn a year by 2030 while adult social would require an additional £20 billion per year.\nHow will we fund this? By Taxing Wealth Fairly\nOur wealth tax will tax the wealth of individual taxpayers with assets above £10 million at 1% and assets above £1bn at 2% annually.\nOur reform Capital Gains Tax will align the rates paid by taxpayers on income and taxable gains. This would affect less than 2% of all income-tax payers.\nAlign tax rates on investment income with the tax and NIC rates on employment income.\nRemove the NI Upper Earnings Limit that restricts the amount of National Insurance paid by high earners. Tax rates should not fall as income increases.\nEquate the rate of pension tax relief with the basic rate of income tax to help fund the social care that will allow elderly and disabled people on low incomes to live in dignity. We estimate that by the end of the next parliament these tax changes could add raise between £50 and £70bn pounds per year in 2024 prices.\nPutting this investment into perspective\nUnder our plans, spending on the NHS would increase by 1% of GDP by 2030. Day-to-day spending on the English NHS is currently around £180bn per year, which is about 6.5% of UK GDP. If the budgets for the devolved administrations are included, this rises to 8% of GDP. By 2029/30 we expect day-to-day spending on the NHS across the UK to rise to 8.9% of GDP (from 8.0%) under current government plans, Our costings add £30 bn to English HNS budget in 2029/30. This would increase the revenue budget for that year by about 12%. Including the devolved administrations, our plans would increase revenue spending on health in 2029/30 to 9.9%, an increase of 1 percentage point.\nNote: On devolved nations, the headline figures here are for England and our costed manifesto will include funding to cover the parallel increases in spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

Having worked in the NHS for over a decade, I have seen how societal injustice has had a huge negative impact on the nation’s health. The Green Party’s vision of a healthy society for all is one that I fully share; it means good quality housing, clean water and material security for all, accessible public services and a clean, safe environment. I am a keen supporter of local initiatives to promote dark skies, create new habitats and reintroduce native species.’\nMark McBennett, Southborough & Bidborough: ‘I’m a local dad and love living in Tunbridge Wells, with all its green spaces, cultural facilities, excellent schools, and convenient train access to both London and the coast.

I recently started a fortnightly support group for men in Tunbridge Wells and am offering counselling to students at a secondary school in Southborough.

  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_greens-call-for-local-and-national-leadership-on-climate-emergency/content_124.html": "Mike Calvert our Campaigns Manager writes about the climate emergency and how we urgently need Green solutions.\n‘Events have not been kind to Greg Clark since he proclaimed the Conservatives’ leadership on climate change in an opinion in the Times of Tunbridge Wells last month. Not only were his claims comprehensively debunked by the Green Party’s John Hurst in a response a couple of weeks later, but Greg’s fellow Tory MP, Chris Skidmore, resigned over the government’s policy of allowing further licences to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea, forcing a by-election which the Tories lost. In his resignation letter he referenced the need to achieve net zero emissions and said: “there is no case to be made for increasing fossil fuel production at a time when investment should be made elsewhere, in the industries and businesses of the future, and not of the past.” Quite.\nAnd now Friends of the Earth have uncovered documents showing that the government’s justification for approving a new coalmine in Cumbria, the supposed long term need for coal for steelmaking, conflicted with the advice ministers were receiving from their own officials that the steel industry would be decarbonised with “high certainty” by 2035 as the industry converted to production by electric arc furnaces.\nClimate leadership at the national level is sadly lacking. But leadership is also needed at the local level. There is so much that could be achieved with the right vision and ambition.\nFor example, Lewes District Council (17 Green Councillors) has teamed up with six other local councils in their area to create a programme for insulating and installing renewable energy for 40,000 social housing homes across the region, using the purchasing power of councils working together to secure funding and commission work at favourable rates, while also generating local jobs. The programme has been so successful, it has been called the Lewes Model and proposed as a template for other councils. It is the sort of imaginative solution which our council in Tunbridge Wells should be exploring.\nThe Council also has leverage when approving new housing. It should make clear to developers that compliance with the internationally recognised Passivhaus standard for energy efficiency and sustainability will be an important factor in demonstrating that a proposed development satisfies the Council’s policy on sustainable design.\nIt’s not just about the Council. It is inspiring to see local businesses and stakeholders coming together in Tunbridge Wells in an organisation called Amplifi which seeks to pool ideas and experiences in promoting sustainable businesses. It’s a wonderfully collaborative initiative. And children at St James School have displayed banners urging passing motorists to turn off their engines when waiting at traffic lights.\nBut individual initiatives can only take us so far. We need more Green MPs and more Green councillors to hold our politicians to account, to stop backsliding on commitments, to contribute ideas and solutions. The same old parties with the same old thinking will not get us out of the climate emergency.\nIn this election year, more than ever, we need more Greens in the room. We have the solutions. But if we don’t vote for them, they won’t happen.’",

  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_reasons-to-be-cheerful/content_155.html": "During this period of wonderfully warm and dry weather, we at the Green Party thought it would be useful to mention some more reasons to be cheerful.\nFirstly, there were many Green gains across Kent and in adjoining areas in the local elections.\nIn Tunbridge Wells we were pleased to stand in all seats for the first time, with a gender-balanced slate, and received a record 8.2% of the vote across the Borough, indicating a likely strong result in the coming General Election. We were pleased to come second to the Conservative in Frittenden & Sissinghurst, and we look forward to next year’s “all out” elections in the new Wards.\nAcross Kent, Greens won an impressive 24 seats, bringing the number of Green Councillors in the County to 52 (see the diagram, showing the degree of Green representation across Kent), and in the adjacent Wealden District Council the Greens won enough seats to jointly lead the Council with the LibDems.\nThe benefits of a strongly Green Council have already been seen in Folkstone & Hythe with the immediate cancellation of a controversial and hugely damaging proposed development on the seafront at Hythe.\nSecondly, the Boundary Commission’s recent report on the Tunbridge Wells Ward Boundaries included some changes that reflect the fact that they listened to some of the feedback from earlier consultations – a rare occurrence in public consultations these days.\nOur Green Party campaign to keep Kilndown in the same Ward as Goudhurst succeeded – the historical connections between those settlements will be maintained in their new Ward.\nThirdly, at a national level the Green Co-leaders Adrian Ramsey and Carla Denya are getting more airtime as they are seen to be offering positive solutions to some of the problems such as climate change, the NHS and housing that a tired government distracted by infighting is not addressing.\nTo cap it all, along comes Nigel Farage, admitting in his own words that ”Brexit has failed”!\nWe take no comfort in the fact that far from providing an extra £350m a week for the NHS, recent figures show that Brexit has actually COST the UK about that amount of money per week from lost exports and lower Government income from the fewer goods we have been producing. But we have always wanted to stay in close contact with our European neighbours, and it was satisfying to see a recent opinion poll in the Observer that found that 63% of the British people believe Brexit has created new problems, compared to only a third of that number thinking it’s been a success.\nSo why does Labour keep trying to convince the public it can make the Conservatives’ Brexit work?\nAs we move towards the next General Election, it’s beginning to look like the Greens who have captured the public mood across the country rather than the official opposition. That’s a reason to be hopeful, as well as cheerful!’",

The Green Party is going to create 150,000 council houses across the country every year, so that’s equivalent to 150 a year in Tunbridge Wells. That gives everybody hope for the future, and more of a fair society. So for Real Hope, and for Real Change, on 4th July – Vote Green!’\nProviding fairer, greener homes for all – from our 2024 Manifesto\nThere are over a million households on council waiting lists. In England you could expect to spend around 8.3 times annual average earnings to buy a home. Over 130,000 children are growing up in temporary accommodation. This national housing crisis is the result of 40 years of governments choosing to treat houses simply as assets rather than as homes, and of neglecting to build new social housing.\nBuilding thousands of unaffordable homes isn’t the answer though – the priority should be providing everybody with a safe, warm affordable home. This means genuinely affordable homes, built to the right standards and in the right place, as part of flourishing communities. It means that we need to make sure all homes are fit for a climate-changed world. And it means protecting the rights of the millions of people who rent their homes.\nElected Greens will push to:\n• Provide 150,000 new social homes a year and end the so-called ‘right to buy’, so that these homes can belong to communities for ever.\n• Empower local authorities to introduce rent controls.\n• End no-fault evictions.\n• Introduce a Fairer, Greener Homes Guarantee to ensure warm, safe homes that are well insulated.\n• Transform the planning system so new developments come with access to public services and green spaces are protected.",

Since 2010 the Government has starved Local Government of the funding needed to provide services – from social care to avoiding potholes – and favoured private over public investment. The very rich have got richer, and billions of pounds have disappeared to overseas shareholders. Healthcare quality has been allowed to slip, with the NHS suffering staff shortages after Brexit. Our environment is being degraded as private companies are allowed to pollute our rivers and the sea, developers are being allowed to build on green fields, and the need to address climate change is put second to profiting from oil and gas. Our homes are the worst-insulated in Europe, and both rents and mortgages are unaffordable or unobtainable for young people. And unless you have money and influence, people have lost hope, and feel their country has left them behind.\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way; I want to restore people’s hope for the future.\nIn Parliament, Green MPs would propose and support measures to reduce inequalities, to improve housing and make it more affordable, and to turn our economy into a thriving green one.\nWe would reform our tax system to make it fairer – including a tax on the super-rich billionaires and multi-millionaires – raising £50billion to invest in our NHS, warmer homes and cleaner rivers.\nWe would restablish links with our European neighbours, and make it easier for young people to study, work and live abroad.\nWe would fight climate change.\nFor Tunbridge Wells my priorities would include:\n– restoring central government funding for the local authority, with priority on social care and on other things that benefit the public, such as home insulation and clean air measures\n– forcing the inclusion of affordable and social housing in new developments, and the use of all brownfield sites before green belt sites can be used\n– ensuring our GP practices and hospitals are fully staffed, and the workforces are properly rewarded\n– ensuring every town and village has buses that can be relied on for school and for shopping trips\n– requiring water and sewage companies to put the public and the environment before profit\n– stopping Gatwick installing a second runway\n– supporting the businesses that are building a green future, and initiatives such as Amplifi\n– training a new generation of people to retrofit home insulation and install heatpumps\nPlease join me in working for a Fairer, Greener Tunbridge Wells!",

We’ve all been jolted by the potholes that seem to get worse every year. The Frant Road is blighted by traffic with heavy lorries speeding past parents dropping their children off at school. The threatened 400 houses on the rugby ground will destroy countryside and increase traffic whilst adding to the burden on our local GPs, schools and utilities.’\nYour Priorities are My Priorities\n‘I’ve been working hard on local issues all year and you may have seen me around Pantiles, Ramslye and Showfields talking to residents and shopkeepers and learning about what matters most to people who live and work here. I will make your priorities my priorities in building a better Tunbridge Wells.’\nThe Actions I Pledge to take are:\n- Improving integration of social care with hospital discharges to home\n- Working with groups making safer streets for women and girls\n- Taking action on anti-social behaviour in public places\n- Lobbying against the 400-house development on the rugby ground\n- Promoting building of truly affordable housing and a new GP surgery\n- Promoting active travel and improving public transport and traffic flow\n- Fixing potholes faster and getting drains unblocked\n‘This is just scratching the surface; there is much more that could be done.‘\nWe are the fastest-growing party in Kent\n‘We need strong, independent voices on Kent County Council, people who will stand up for Tunbridge Wells and not be tied to a party line. The Green Party already has five councillors on Kent County Council and leads the opposition but your vote can help us win more, to make us the strongest voice protecting and enhancing our communities and services.’\nAbout Jeremy\n‘I recently retired after a career in arts administration – during which time I ran eight London marathons in a row!

Here’s what he had to say.\nMartin: Voters in Tunbridge Wells go to the polls on Thursday 4th May. They will be electing one third of the Borough Council. I’m joined by Geoff Mason who is Chair of Tunbridge Wells Green Party. Geoff, the Green Party doesn’t have any councillors in Tunbridge Wells at the moment so how are you approaching this election?\nGeoff: Well we’re really excited this year to be standing candidates in all 16 wards. It’s something we’ve not done before and we absolutely want to give everybody who wants to vote Green the chance to vote Green. We look enviously at the 23 Green Councillors across Kent but there are none on Tunbridge Wells Borough Council and that’s something we want to change.\nMartin: So the Borough Council at the moment is run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Tunbridge Wells Alliance Party. How do you think they’re doing? They’ve been in power for a year what’s their record been do you think?\nGeoff: From a Green Party perspective we look at how they’ve done on the Climate Emergency. This was declared in 2019 but it doesn’t feel very much like an emergency. The original proposal for example was to include citizens assemblies. What happened to this? And if we look at their own figures, the target was to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030 and the pathway to do this was for around 2,500 tonnes to be produced in 2022. But by their own figures they’re on for 3,700 tonnes.\nMartin: So this is just in the borough of Tunbridge Wells?\nGeoff: Absolutely. So we think that at the moment they’re going to miss their net zero target by 2030 by some considerable margin.\nMartin: And it’s not the emissions of everybody who lives in Tunbridge Wells, it’s just the things that the council has control of.\nGeoff: 100% absolutely right.\nMartin: One big issue locally is housing and the local plan proposed a new large town of around 3,000 people between Tudeley and Capel. The national housing inspector has thrown doubts on the sustainability of that but the Borough Council coalition seems to be pressing on trying to make that still happen. What do you think of this plan to build a new town between Tudeley and Capel?\nGeoff: I think it’s absolutely heart-breaking if you look at the impact on the countryside around Capel, the size and scale of the proposals are far beyond anything that the ward can deal with. A new town, effectively that’s what it will be, will bring so much pollution, a spoiled landscape, loss of wildlife habitat and protected species and it’s completely in the wrong place, I mean there are flooding risks as well. Now Matthew Birkenshaw the inspector was basically giving a steer that this whole proposal should be dropped altogether and so we are absolutely astonished that Tunbridge Wells Borough Council are spending £851,000 of council taxpayers’ money to basically try and justify something that any normal person would say is completely mad.\nMartin: So if a Green councillor was elected, would you say that they would vote to end that proposal?\nGeoff: Without question.\nMartin: But you do then end up having a problem in that are there enough new places for people and for young people to live in the area?\nGeoff: We know that there are 4,934 hectares of brownfield sites across the region. And we also know that the calculation for the amount of new housing needed was based on 2014 ONS data which was wrong. So if the correct data were used and brownfield sites were investigated, we are absolutely convinced that the use of greenfield sites could be dropped altogether.\nMartin: So finally Geoff how would you sum up why people should vote Green on May 4th?\nGeoff: I think it’s really important for the people of Tunbridge Wells to have a Green councillor elected. It means that that person can challenge the council, hold them to account and make sure that effective services are delivered balancing environmental sustainability. And we say that a Green in the room can make a difference.\nMartin: Geoff Mason, Chair of Tunbridge Wells Green Party thank you very much. I’m Martin Webber for West Kent Radio.",

  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_housing/content_88.html": "The cost of renting and buying a home in Kent is rising at an alarming rate, placing immense pressure on young working adults and families, particularly those relying on a single income. The latest data reveals the scale of the crisis: Sevenoaks now has the highest rental costs in Kent, with average rents consuming 59% of an individual’s full-time salary. It costs on average £1,598 a month to rent a home according to latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.\nTunbridge Wells faces similar challenges. Average rents in the area now account for 53.7% of an individual’s income with the average rent climbing to £1,385 per month. Households in Dartford, Maidstone, and Canterbury are also under pressure. Dover remains the most affordable location in Kent, but even there, rents still consume 25% of the average full-time salary.\nThe situation is no better for those seeking to buy a home. Across Great Britain, the average house price is 7.8 times the average salary. Here in Tunbridge Wells, the income-to-house-price ratio is 11.9. This means to buy a medium-priced property in Tunbridge Wells – the average house price is £472,000 – a household would need 11.9 times their annual salary.\nThese figures highlight the growing inaccessibility of homeownership for many young working adults, especially those without significant savings or dual incomes.\nThe Green Party’s Commitment to Affordable Housing\nThe Green Party understands that housing is a fundamental right, not a luxury. Our national and local policies aim to address the root causes of the housing crisis, ensuring everyone has access to a warm, secure, and affordable home. Locally, Tunbridge Wells Green Party is advocating sustainable, community-led solutions to tackle rising rents and house prices.\nThe Green Party’s “Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price” charter outlines a transformative vision for housing in the UK. This includes:\n- Fair and affordable housing: Local authorities and national government must collaborate to deliver homes that people can afford to rent or buy.\n- Sustainable developments: Protect valuable green spaces while reducing climate emissions through smarter planning.\n- Energy efficiency: Ensure all new homes meet heating and insolation standards, featuring solar panels and heat pumps to reduce energy costs and emissions.\n- Investments in local services: Require new housing developments to include investments in local health, transport, and community infrastructure.\nA Greener, Fairer Future for Renters\nMillions of private renters face unaffordable costs and constant insecurity. The Green Party’s Fair Deal for Renters aims to:\n- Introduce rent controls so local authorities can cap rents in unaffordable markets. Here is an excellent article on rent control: LeftFootForward\n- Establish a new stable rental tenancy to end no-fault evictions, providing renters with greater security.\n- Empower tenants to demand energy efficiency improvements to reduce energy bills and carbon emissions.\n- Create private residential tenancy boards for affordable, informal dispute resolution.\nThese policies aim to make renting a secure, fair, and sustainable option for everyone.\nTackiling the Cost of HomeOwnership\nFor those looking to buy, skyrocketing house prices are making homeownership an impossible dream for many. Lenders traditionally offer mortgages of four to five times the buyer’s income, leaving single-income households particularly disadvantaged. With the average home in Tunbridge Wells costing over 11 times the average salary, homeownership is increasingly out of reach for local residents.\nThe Green Party proposes bold solutions to make homeownership more accessible:\n- Build 150,000 new social homes annually through a mix of new construction and refurbishment of older housing stock.\n- End the individual “Right to Buy” scheme to preserve social housing stock for future generations.\n- Introduce a community right to buy, empowering local authorities to purchase and repurpose properties for social housing.\nInvesting in Energy Efficiency\nIn addition to addressing affordability, the Green Party is committed to tackling the energy crisis through its Fairer, Greener Homes Guarantee. With UK homes among the least insulated in Europe, energy bills are unnecessarily high. The party’s plan includes:\n- A £29bn investment over five years to insulate homes to EPC B standard or above.\n- A £9bn investment for low-carbon heating systems, such as heat pumps.\n- Street-by-street retrofitting programmes led by local authorities to adapt homes for extreme climate conditions.\nThese measures will reduce household energy bills, cut carbon emissions, and create thousands of green jobs.\nWorking Together for a Better Future\nTunbridge Wells Green Party is dedicated to ensuring everyone in Kent has access to affordable housing, whether renting or buying. By championing these policies locally and supporting the Green Party’s national initiatives, we are working to create a housing market that puts people and communities first.\nWe believe housing is a right, not a privilege. With bold action and innovative thinking, we can tackle the housing crisis and ensure every resident in Kent has a place to call home.",

We’ve also called for the end of British arms exports to Israel, and some of those arms are actually being produced in Kent, in Rochester and Sandwich, it’s all too close by. Now, I’m not going to relate any of this to asking you which way to vote in the General Election, but whatever our beliefs, I’d like to propose that we all pray together for a full ceasefire in Gaza. Let’s Hope – Thank You.’\nBuilding a safer world – from our 2024 Manifesto\nIsrael and Palestine\nThe Green Party has been calling for an immediate bilateral ceasefire in the war between Israel and Gaza and the return of hostages since mid-October 2023. We condemned the appalling murder of hundreds of Israeli civilians by Hamas on 7 October and for which Hamas should be held to account, and since then have watched in horror as Israeli forces have committed war crimes that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians.\nGreen MPs will push for:\n• An immediate and permanent bilateral ceasefire.\n• A durable political solution that ensures security and equal rights for Israelis and Palestinians. This is the only way to achieve long-term security for the people of Palestine and Israel.\n• Recognition of the state of Palestine and an urgent international effort to end the illegal occupation of Palestinian land.\n• Investigation and prosecution of war crimes. We believe there is strong evidence to support South Africa’s submission to the International Court of Justice that Israel is guilty of genocide in its conduct in Gaza.\n• An end to all UK arms exports to and military cooperation with Israel, which make the British government complicit in these war crimes.\nForeign Policy\nIn a world threatened by war and the rise of authoritarian regimes, the Green Party believes that the UK’s foreign policy should be based on shared commitments to democracy, peace, global solidarity and the protection of human rights. It has never been more important to support the rule of law, including the international law that underpins our rights and protects against state aggression, genocide and the inhuman treatment of refugees.\nIn a world threatened by climate-driven instability and mass migration, there is an ever-greater need for enlightened leadership and international solidarity.\nThe Green Party wants to see the UK:\n• Take the lead in upholding the right to self-determination and the enforcement of international law.\n• Continue to support Ukraine as it resists Russian invasion.\n• Work towards reform of the European security architecture and disarmament, based on shared commitments to democracy and mutual transparency.\n• Rejoin and play its full part in the family of nations that is the European Union, as soon as possible.",
  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_a-green-in-the-room-will-make-the-difference/content_41.html": "Mike Calvert writes ‘climate breakdown is the most important challenge we will face in our lifetimes. It threatens our security and the very foundations of our society. Don’t take my word for it – David Attenborough warned recently: “If we continue on our current path, we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security”.\nWe need local, as well as national, leadership that is up to the challenge.\nTunbridge Wells Borough Council declared a Climate Emergency in 2019 and has adopted a target of reaching net zero carbon emissions for its own operations by 2030. Their recommended pathway required emissions to be reduced to around 2,500 tonnes by 2022, but according to their own report, emissions were at 3,700 tonnes, barely down from the do nothing “business as usual” position. Without more determined leadership, they are going to miss their net zero target by a very long way.\nThere is so much that could be done.\nThe Council’s Action Plan for 2021-22 discounted investing in large scale renewable generation projects, like solar parks, partly because of the “low rating of political acceptability”. Other councils made more far-sighted decisions: Cambridgeshire County Council invested in a solar farm which is reducing its carbon footprint and provides over £350,000 every year to support council services and keep council taxes down. They are now looking at building a solar park with twice the capacity. Why is TWBC so far behind the curve? This is not about party politics – in Cambridgeshire, the Conservatives are the largest party on the council. It’s about a lack of vision, a lack of ambition.\nPlanning powers should be used to the utmost to promote sustainable development. Incredibly, the Government has not made it a requirement for new developments to have solar panels on their roofs. But there is still much that councils can do. Bristol City Council, which now has 25 Green councillors, makes clear to developers that it will assess their planning applications against sustainability criteria which include securing a 20% saving in CO2 emissions from energy use through on-site generation of renewable energy.\nOur Council also needs to follow the example of Lewes District Council (8 Green councillors). They have teamed up with six other local councils in their area to create a programme for insulating and installing renewable energy for 40,000 social homes across the region, one of the largest retrofit programmes in the country. This uses the purchasing power of councils working together to achieve economies of scale to secure funding and commission work at favourable rates, while also generating local jobs.\nThis is just scratching the surface. There is so much more that could be done.\nClimate breakdown is not going to wait for us to get our act together. Now, more than ever, we need a Green in the room: a Green councillor to hold the Council to account for failing to meet its own targets, a Green councillor to propose the solutions.\nAnd now you have the opportunity to do something about it; for the first time, the Green party is putting up candidates in every ward in May’s elections. Together we can make it happen.’",
  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_white-paper/content_18.html": "A summary of the White Paper\nThe English Devolution White Paper sets out a new framework aiming to redefine the relationship between local and central government in England. It proposes a more integrated and expansive approach to devolved governance, emphasising the creation of Mayoral Strategic Authorities and the reorganisation of local government structures. The government aims to extend devolution across the country by creating combined authorities, encouraging local councils to form larger regional partnerships and introducing elected mayors with wide-ranging powers.\nThe framework prioritises the establishment of Strategic Authorities that encompass multiple local authorities over a “strategic geography,” with an optimal population of 1.5 million. The powers of these authorities span areas like transport, housing, economic development, and climate change. Mayoral Strategic Authorities can request additional powers and participate in decisions regarding national policies that impact their areas. This includes a streamlined funding system with consolidated grants for housing, transport, and local growth initiatives, providing these areas with greater financial flexibility.\nKey proposed changes include abolishing district councils in some two-tier local government areas to establish unitary authorities. Such reforms would impact decision-making structures and could centralise power, shifting responsibilities like planning and education to fewer elected representatives. Critics highlight the risk of distancing local governance from communities, potentially creating “devolution islands” where smaller councils are left isolated.\nFurthermore, the paper outlines plans for long-term financial settlements for devolved regions, an expansion of mayoral powers in planning and infrastructure development, and enhanced control over regional transport systems. The introduction of Local Growth Plans is expected to align devolved decision-making with broader national economic objectives. However, concerns remain regarding the potential loss of democratic accountability, with increased powers being concentrated in regional mayors.\nThe white paper also proposes reforms to local audit systems and councillor conduct, including mandatory codes of conduct and suspensions for repeated breaches. Proposals such as aligning local authority and strategic public service boundaries, enabling remote attendance at council meetings, and reviewing standards boards are designed to modernise and standardise governance across England.\nThe government’s ultimate goal is to have all regions of England covered by Strategic Authorities, believing this will enhance local decision-making and align with broader national objectives. However, questions persist about the lack of direct public input into these reforms and whether they address the real needs of local communities.\nTUNBRIDGE WELLS GREEN PARTY’S RESPONSE\nThe recently proposed English Devolution White Paper represents a significant shift in how local government operates, but it raises serious questions about democracy, transparency, and fairness. While we welcome conversations about improving governance and delivering better services, this proposal seems to concentrate power at a higher level rather than devolving it down to local communities, which runs counter to the spirit of devolution.\nWe are deeply concerned that this is being pushed through without proper public consultation, and it was not included in Labour’s manifesto. Why isn’t there a referendum for such a fundamental change to how we govern our communities? The public deserves a say, especially when the outcome will have such far-reaching implications for our councils and the services they provide.\nThe idea of improving transport infrastructure to a level similar to what we see in London or Manchester is appealing in principle. However, achieving this across a geographically diverse and financially constrained county like Kent seems highly unlikely without significant and sustained funding. There’s a real risk that this promise will remain unfulfilled, leaving residents frustrated and underserved.\nAt its core, this proposal feels like a power grab. It dismantles district councils, abolishes key local decision-making structures, and consolidates authority into the hands of a regional mayor and a small group of elected representatives. While we do support reducing waste and inefficiency within the current system—such as cutting the number of costly directors and chief executives—a shift this dramatic risks sidelining local voices in favour of centralised control.\nFor West Kent, there is a case to be made for a combined council structure. Sharing resources and running services like waste contracts across a broader area could bring cost savings and improved efficiency. This is already happening to some extent, with partnerships between Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge & Malling Borough Councils. However, whether Maidstone would fit into this structure without creating something too large and unwieldy remains an open question.\nWe are also worried about how this plan will impact the poorer parts of Kent. All councils in Kent already bear responsibilities for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, however, some councils, like Dover or Thanet, can be disproportionately affected leaving us to wonder how this issue would be addressed in the new system. Will they receive the funding and resources they need or be further stretched? Similarly, there’s a risk that more affluent areas like West Kent, despite having pockets of real deprivation, could be penalised in funding allocations.\nThe current system is undeniably flawed—fragmented, wasteful, and inefficient—but this proposal does not seem to be the solution. Instead of centralising power, we should focus on creating a governance structure that genuinely delivers decision-making closer to the people it impacts, supports those most in need, and ensures resources are fairly distributed across the county. Anything less is a missed opportunity and a disservice to the communities we represent.\nTHE WIDER GREEN PARTY’S RESPONSE\nThe Green Party has long championed the importance of local councils, not only as the closest representatives to their communities but as crucial drivers of the large-scale change we need to see in areas such as building warmer homes, cleaning up our rivers, reforming social care, and greening our local economies. It is clear that meaningful change begins at the local level, with the people and institutions who know their communities best.\nThis White Paper is a step in the wrong direction. By taking power further away from councils and local people, it risks deepening the disillusionment and cynicism about politics that we are already seeing in communities across the country. For local democracy to thrive, it must be built on trust and genuine decentralisation of power. That means giving local councils the resources, investment, and authority they need to make decisions that have the greatest impact where it matters most.\nThe Green Party believes that devolution must mean real decentralisation, not just a reshuffling of power to larger, more distant bodies. That is why the party will continue to stand up for local government to remain truly local and to be made more democratic so councils like yours can deliver the vital improvements your communities deserve. Specifically, the party are calling for:\n- Decisions to be taken as close as possible to the people most affected;\n- Trusting local communities to know what is best for them;\n- Providing councils with the investment they need to deliver meaningful change;\n- Fair voting in local elections through proportional representation.\nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay’s statement was picked up by the Guardian live blog: “This White Paper steals power away from local people and risks making the real changes required harder to achieve… We should trust local communities to make the right decisions on homes, food, energy, nature and adapting to the climate crisis. Instead, these plans risk moving power away from local councils to huge remote super councils and regional mayors.”\nThe Canary included Adrian’s social media reaction to the White Paper: “This proposal is a dangerous erosion of local democracy. It steals power from communities & risks alienating people from the democratic process.”\nIn the Commons, Green MP Ellie Chowns challenged the government over the ‘democratic deficit’ in the proposals. She asked the minister: “A local tier in some places will be replaced by a more distant mayoral tier. Does the Minister recognize this risks creating a bit of a democratic deficit? So really we should be trying to keep the local in local government as much as possible.” She also asked whether the government would introduce fair and proportional voting in local elections. See her intervention and the minister’s response on Twitter, which also featured on BBC Radio Hereford and Worcester this morning. You can read Ellie’s full statement here.\nZoe Nicholson, Green Party leader of Lewis District Council, told the BBC the plans are a “power grab” and “the death knell for local democracy.” She accused Rayner of “bringing down the elected institutions that stand in her way” to force through planning decisions about new house building.” She added: “We cannot allow the government to ride roughshod over the democratic rights of residents and hand yet more power to men in grey suits.”\nCaroline Topping, Green Party Leader of East Suffolk Council, told the Ipswich Star: “We will need time to consider the full implications of the Government’s White Paper, however our view of devolution and the principles of local government reorganisation remains unchanged. We must focus on how proposals in the White Paper benefit the residents of East Suffolk, preserve or strengthen real local democratic accountability, and ensure a close link between residents and the councillors who represent them.”\nGreen leader of Maidstone council, Cllr Stuart Jeffery, said the White Paper was “what we expected.” He told Kent online: “We need to make the best of something that is the centralisation of power which, to me, goes against the concept of devolution. It’s putting power into the hands of one person, but I would welcome more money coming into Kent.”",

Here in the town, we read in last week’s Times of Tunbridge Wells that the Nourish Community Foodbank is struggling to meet demand as rising energy bills and the cost of living hit families already struggling. Then later in the same edition, the motoring section highlights an £8,400 rear seat option for a £200,000 luxury SUV to make the back seats more comfortable. Don’t these contrasting articles perfectly summarise the Conservative vision of Britain?\nContrast this with the Green Party Conference in Harrogate where delegates voted for a progressive tax on the richest one per cent of households to fund a nationwide insulation and renewable energy programme, creating warmer, more comfortable homes and bringing bills down for good. A ‘dirty profits tax’ on North Sea oil and gas has 94% public support and would help accelerate the transition to cleaner, cheaper renewable energy. Better for the environment and better for struggling families. Isn’t a Wellbeing Economy the humane alternative?\nHaving a Green voice locally can help make these ambitions become a reality, you only have to look at what Greens are doing across the South East. Bus services are essential to the support of rural and suburban communities and Green councillors in Kent are leading the charge to protect the 56 bus routes across the county under threat of the axe by operators leaving parents worrying about how their children will get to school. Green-led Lewes District Council are setting out an ambitious plan to tackle the shocking state of badly insulated homes by retrofitting social housing at a large scale thereby delivering warmer homes, green jobs and lower carbon emissions at the same time making it accessible for all households. In Maidstone, it’s the Green Party that’s challenging the creation of an ‘Investment Zone’ in Kent the result of which will be the scrapping of planning laws to allow building on precious green spaces across the county flying in the face of the ecological emergency.\nGiven all this, it’s not surprising that local people have had enough of the excesses of the Conservative party and are turning to the Greens. Despite our antiquated First Past The Post system, we’re getting Green councillors elected across the region in numbers. Witness the recent Maresfield council by-election result where Ian Tysh romped home for the Greens with 61% of the vote.\nIn Conservative Britain, the rich are getting richer and everyone else is getting poorer and the prime minister has been doing everything she can to maintain these injustices. She doubled down on the Tories’ lack of compassion and awareness of people’s real-life concerns as the cost of living crisis is allowed to continue and gather pace. What does Greg Clark think of all this? His silence is deafening.\nThe next borough elections are in May 2023. Isn’t it time we had a Green voice on Tunbridge Wells Borough Council?",

We offer people a different type of politics – a change that is increasingly recognised as important and necessary.\nI was elected to Paddock Wood Town Council two years ago, and have seen the struggles people are going through as I walk the streets in my job as a postie. As a former police officer I have a background in dealing with difficult situations where I had to negotiate with groups of people holding different views, and that has stood me in good stead in council meetings, as I’m sure you can imagine!\nI am pleased to say that together with a fellow councillor and the estates manager, we have developed a plan that will see several hundred trees planted in the area, starting next year; it will be a legacy for the future. But I have been very unhappy with the Town Council’s lack of influence on the amount of new housing planned around the town, and also with the LibDem-led Borough Partnership allocating another £850,000 of Council Tax-payers’ money to try and make the flawed Local Plan acceptable to the Government Inspector, apparently without fundamental changes to the excessive use of Green Belt land.\nI want to represent Paddock Wood West and ask the important questions of the Town Council. Why does the Town Hall have such a high staff turnover rate? Why is so much money being spent on external consultants? Why aren’t councillors delivering on the climate emergency declaration they voted for?\nHaving been a member of the Green Party for many years I have seen us grow, and also seen other parties react to our growth.\nThey say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and I was pleased to see that a year after the Green Party adopted “for fairer, greener communities” as its slogan for the 2022 local elections, Hugo Pound (Times, 5th April) was promising the same for Tunbridge Wells from Labour.\nAnd indeed, here in Paddock Wood West I’m hearing lots of people on their doorsteps saying they are willing to put past loyalties to one side, and lend me their vote to make sure they get a strong voice on the council. The Greens have always been well received in Paddock Wood, and it’s sad to see yet another LibDem bar chart come through the door which could give the innocent reader the impression that only they can save the ward from the Conservatives – the truth is the LibDems were last in five of the last six elections here, and only got 50 votes last year.\nI’m running a straight and honest campaign in my quest to make the transfer from Town to Borough Councillor at this election, and I urge anyone who shares my concern about the loss of our green spaces to support me.’",
  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_23-million-boost-for-kent-buses-green-party-celebrates-win-for-public-transport/content_127.html": "In a significant win for public transport, Kent County Council (KCC) has secured a £23 million government grant to support bus services across the county. The funding, part of the Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP), will help shore up existing routes and potentially restore services that were recently axed.\nThe announcement was met with widespread approval at a recent KCC environment and transport committee meeting. Green Party councillor Mark Hood, representing Tonbridge, described the grant as a “huge amount of money” and praised the efforts of KCC’s public transport team.\nWhat the Funding Means for Kent\nThe £23 million grant is the largest tranche yet under the BSIP scheme, bringing the total funding received by KCC to £58.2 million. The money will be divided into three key areas:\n- £10.1 million for revenue support to keep existing services running.\n- £11 million for capital projects, including bus shelter repairs and real-time passenger information systems.\n- £1 million in direct grants to bus operators.\nCurrently, 51 bus services in Kent rely on financial support to remain operational. Without this funding, many of these routes would likely be cancelled, leaving communities isolated. The new grant will help protect these vital services while also exploring opportunities to restore recently lost routes, such as the No 55 service in Ringlestone near Maidstone.\nCllr Mark Hood emphasised the importance of this funding, stating, “This is a lifeline for bus users across Kent. But while this grant is welcome, it’s only a fraction of what’s needed to transform our public transport system. We need sustained investment to make buses affordable, reliable, and accessible for everyone.”\nChallenges Ahead\nDespite the positive news, challenges remain. The bus sector continues to face financial pressures, and KCC anticipates needing to support even more services in the coming year. Residents in Ringlestone, for example, are already feeling the impact of service cuts. After losing their No 55 service, they’ve petitioned KCC to use part of the new grant to restore their connection to Maidstone.\nPhil Lightowler, KCC’s head of public transport, described the grant as a “lifeline for bus users” and expressed hope for greater integration between bus and rail networks in the future. He also highlighted the potential for AI to address ticketing issues, making public transport more seamless and user-friendly.\nFairer, Greener Transport Choices\nThe Green Party has long championed better, cheaper, and more accessible public transport. Our manifesto commits to:\n- Increasing annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to £10 billion by the end of the next Parliament, including free bus travel for under-18s.\n- Investing an additional £19 billion over five years to improve public transport, support electrification, and create new cycleways and footpaths.\n- Bring the railways back into public ownership.\n- Giving local authorities greater control over bus services to ensure they meet community needs.\nOur transport choices account for around a quarter of carbon emissions, so it’s vital to make it easier to opt for greener choices. Yet public transport provision continues to decline, often leaving those on low incomes with no affordable options. Greens MPs will champion better, cheaper public transport, so that every community is connected and can thrive.\nWalking, wheeling and cycling don’t just help reduce carbon emissions and air pollution – they can make us all happier and healthier too.\nElected Greens will push for:\n- Investment of £2.5bn a year in new cycleways and footpaths.\n- Reimagining how we use streets in residential areas to reduce traffic and open them up for community use.\n- Adopting Active Travel England’s objective of 50% of trips in England’s towns and cities to be walked, wheeled or cycled by 2030.\nAviation is the fastest-growing source of CO2 emissions, and it’s the wealthiest driving this trend.\nGreens will push for:\n- A frequent-flyer levy.\n- A ban on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train.\n- A halt to the expansion of new airport capacity.",

  "https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_/https_tunbridgewells_greenparty_org_uk_may-2024-local-election-results/content_136.html": "Fantastic results locally in Kent and Sussex where there are now 10 Green Councillors in Maidstone and 9 in Hastings. In Tunbridge Wells we stood a full slate of 18 candidates across 14 wards so that everyone in the borough had a chance to vote Green if they wanted to. Whilst we’re obviously disappointed not to have got one of us over the line and elected to council, we were delighted with the fact that 5,485 voters put their cross against a Green candidate. We achieved a 17% vote share in Rural Tunbridge Wells and 12% in Pantiles and with 7% of the vote across the board, a proportional voting system would have elected two Green councillors. So much to be positive about as we look ahead.\nIn the meantime we’ll be back on the campaign trail with lots of events coming up. We’ve joined forces with local environmental groups to form the Tunbridge Wells Climate Coalition and we’re looking forward to working with Amplifi as we work towards a more sustainable borough.\nFancy getting involved? Come along to our Green Café we’d love to meet you. For details of this and all our events, sign up to our mailing list.",
