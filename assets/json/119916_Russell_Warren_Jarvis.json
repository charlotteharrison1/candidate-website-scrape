We are still building this branch from scratch and are grateful for any assistance we can get.\nThis website is currently under construction; like everything else at REFORM UK. Since most of us are still working full time, there is, unfortunately, only very little time left to dedicate to projects like this website. Nonetheless, thank you for coming here and…\nA very warm welcome\nto our local Mid-Bucks REFORM group. We are a group of average people who feel that our country is headed in the wrong direction in so many areas and we want to do something about it! Many of us are completely new to politics but we strongly believe that we have to act now to rectify this path and create a better country for us and our children."
