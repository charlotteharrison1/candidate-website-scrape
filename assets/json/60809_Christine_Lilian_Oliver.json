Dangerbecause emergency vehicles can’t get about, and danger to local livelihoods and businesses\nGridlock and danger because of a combination of predictable problems that Conservatives in\npower in London, at KCC and at DDC have failed for years to head-off when warned. The combination of problems creating the omni-shambles in East Kent includes deregulating\nworkers rights so that P&O Ferries owners feel they can get away with mass sackings, and think\nthey can allow vessels to put to sea without safety checks; but safety matters, so the 3 P&0\nferries continue out-of-action. It includes the extra red tape for exports that has been causing extra TAP queues for months,\nextra stink for Aycliffe and elsewhere, loss of income for exporters and for hauliers.\nIt includes a customs computer meltdown last week; the vulnerability of the IT systems is some-\nthing professionals have been warning of for years, see the National Audit Office reports\nIt includes an entirely predictable large number of Brits desperate to get away for a much\nneeded break with Easter falling late this year. It includes a gross failure to install toilets along the M/A20 or in Dover town (which has less\nthan half as many loos per head of population compared to other East Kent towns, see our Green\nParty petition of 2020). With KCC’s Operation Brock redirecting all cars from East Kent coast\nto Sevington to board Eurotunnel, it keeps more cars on the roads for longer. A number of the warnings were discussed at a DDC scrutiny meeting in November 2018,\nfollowing the traffic analysis carried out by Imperial College published March 2018. However\nmuch DDC leaders suggest we be prepared’, there is reason to expect more lost weekends in\nDover, this year and next. The Dover IBF at Whitfield is going ahead closer to the town than many of us think is sensible,\ngiven the impact of traffic jams on the town that we have now. Conservative DDC cabinet failed\nto stand up to central Conservative Dept for Transport in February 2021 at their extraordinary\ncouncil meeting, they rolled over, instead of pushing for re-location where the A2 is dualled.\nThere was a similar failure to use negotiating leverage with HMRC by KCC on 18 March 2021. Almost all of the aspects of the traffic mayhem could and should have been prevented by those\nin power. The only problem beyond their control were the gales on 1st April that put a DFDS\nferry out of service briefly. Let’s thank DFDS and Eurotunnel and Stagecoach buses for all the extra work they’ve put in\nthis month. But seriously, we’ve all put up with this complacent mess-making Conservative\nparty ruling Kent for long enough. Let’s all get out and vote for non-conservative candidates\nnext time round, new councillors are sure to make a better job of sorting our toilets, our roads,\nour ferries, (and our breweries).",

With a 40degree heat wave experienced in the UK in July 2022, the climate emergency is not a party political slogan. It is reality; things are worse than when we initiated 3 Town council Climate Emergency declarations in June and July 2019, when DDC passed a climate emergency declaration in Jan 2020. Many parties now talk the talk on the climate emergency.\nIn April 2023, before the May elections, executive officers of our Green Party met and agreed that no new Green Party DDC councillor would prop up a minority Conservative group at DDC.\nWe are delighted to see Cllr Kevin Mills become the Labour leader of DDC, very ably backed up by Cllr Jamie Pout as deputy Labour leader. They are both people who we’ve learned to trust.\nWe will be presenting to them the masses of evidence that shows how together, in partnership with town councils, and with civil society, DDC can walk the walk much more effectively 2023 – 2027 to make the whole district zero carbon, to make all homes energy-saving homes, before the ‘long grass’ date of 2050.\nThis is what many, many climate, nature and cost-of-living concerned residents in our Dover district say they want. We note that Conservatives in central government have betrayed the hopes of many, enabling profiteering energy corporates to make things much worse, increasing poverty, attacking nature and wildlife.\nMay 2023 saw our Green Party councillor groups elected on to three of the town councils, 3 councillors to Dover, 3 to Walmer and 4 to Deal. Many thanks to voters for your trust.\nThese are town councils where Green councillors had served 2019 -2023. In Dover and Deal Town Councils 2019-2023 it was often very difficult to get the Labour leadership of those town councils to respect suggestions that our councillors made on help for residents with low carbon options and to meet the commitments made in 2019. This culminated at Deal Town’s full council meeting on 28th Feb 2023 (Agenda Item 7, Attachment 4 refers*) when Labour Cllr Sue Beer (deputy chair), made a recommendation to disband the Environment Cttee, a controlling move designed to stop elected councillors of different parties working together. This recommendation was voted down.\nIn Walmer Town Council, 2019 -2023, a small Green group of 2-3 was able to work constructively with the Independent leadership to get a number of services (secure cycle hub at Walmer Station, thermal camera service, off-street EV chargers) put in place.\nIn May 2023, with a different set of councillors voted onto Dover, Walmer and Deal town councils, our minority groups have had to make difficult, least-worst, decisions about who to vote for, in order to protect the mission of helping residents cut energy bills, and to protect the natural world.\nThis has resulted in Cllr Sue Jones (Lab) being elected to lead Dover Town Council as mayor (deputy Cllr Ed Biggs (Lab)); Cllr Trevor Bond (Con) being elected to lead Walmer Town Council (deputy Cllr Lou Ludwig (Ind)), and Cllr Oliver Richardson (Con) being elected to lead Deal Town Council (deputy Cllr Les Craggs (Lab)).\nIt has meant in 2 cases (Deal and Walmer) voting against a nominee wanting to dissolve the committee or working group responsible for local low energy innovation and natural protections.\nDover and Deal Green Party councillors look forward to working constructively with councillors of all parties and none, with the many volunteers and community groups, and organisations, who share with us the determination to protect our communities and our natural carbon-capturing environment in very tough times.\nNote:* Deal TC Agenda 28 Feb 2023: Re Environment Cttee, Recommendation : That DealTC disbands the climate committee from May 2023 and that climate change becomes the direct responsibility of the Full Council.\nStatement agreed by exec officers and cllrs of Dover & Deal Green Party Fri 26 May 2023.",

Our fourth position sends a loud message to the incoming government that many voters want cleaner, less lobby-laden government.\nOur supporters made it clear to us that they like the fact that our Green Party does not have self-interested multi-millionaire donors to satisfy. They appreciate this is the reason Green Party candidates, MPs and councillors are free to focus 100% on the needs of the communities they represent.\nDuring the short six week election campaign, Christine Oliver, our clued up, determined, locally resident candidate did more than any other to meet and listen to concerns of local voters. The Labour, Reform and Conservative parties that polled first, second and third place ahead of us in the Dover and Deal constituency, threw so many more leaflets and so much more money at voters than we did, because they have the money from self-interested lobby groups. We prefer to depend on local citizens, and to campaign for a cleaned up political system, less influenced by multi-millionaires, with fairer voting.\nIn Dover and Deal, Christine Oliver was one of 15 Green candidates across Kent who polled between 5.2% and 15.1% on 4th July. We polled 6.5% in Dover and Deal where 62% of people registered to vote did decide to vote. More evidence that our policies and our hard work has made us the fastest growing party in Kent as regards councils.\nAcross Kent we have 54 people elected to district / borough councils and 5 elected to KCC. We’ll keep on working in the community and on town councils here, to help us all get through what will continue to be tough times. In Kent we hope to have a bigger team elected in May 2025 to get more work done at KCC next year.

Market-goers were invited to experience a display laying bare the urgency of the climate crisis, and campaigners were overwhelmed by the huge amount of positive response and appreciation from passersby.\nA soil-filled wheelbarrow at the stall’s entrance referred to its contents as the “living skin which so many of us take for granted. Plastic containers combined as stark sculptures speaking of plastic’s toxic effect on human health, wildlife of seas and land, biodiversity and soil quality. Suspended footprints highlighted small steps ordinary folks are taking more and more to reduce pollution and rein in climate breakdown. The ‘Green Barrows’ climate action display team gave a lively performance too!\nLike with almost all of the events reported here, our local Green Party members were involved as part of a bigger team participating in a non-party-political action.\nThe stall marked the end of Great Big Green Week and was hosted by East Kent Climate Action and Deal With It-Transition Deal. The previous weekend had seen a well-attended Community Beach Clean around Deal Pier, and a Community Forage for all the family by Lucia Stuart from Deal’s Wild Kitchen.\nElsewhere in Dover district, Transition Dover were giving out Climate Change Action Packs to young people on Sat 24th at Dover’s Urban Fete run by Dover Big Local. Again there were very many positive, enthusiastic responses from the public despite the wet weather. Another event during the Climate coalition’s week of action week took place at the East Kent Ploughing Match in Little Mongeham on Wed 28th, where supporters of Nature Friendly Farming Network were handing out copies of ‘A Practical Guide to Farming for Climate’, and working with East Kent Wildlife Group and their rehomed 9 year old barn owl, Haze to sign people up for boxes for owls, tawny, owl or barn. Numbers of owls have fallen sadly in recent decades. Again the response from the East Kent public was very, very positive. Including when campaigners suggested people might like to sign the RSPB petition online asking the Truss Conservative government to stop and reverse their attack on nature. Along with the Wildlife Trusts, CPRE and many other charities and organisations, RSPB denounced the dumping of 100s of environmental protections on 23rd Sept 2022.\nThe sixth mass extinction event that we are living through, (as Sir David Attenborough points out), and which has seen some bird species in UK halved over the last 40 years is an issue the public care deeply about. So is the climate crisis which set fire to British homes during this year’s heatwave. In East Kent the public are climate-concerned, they are wised up and these are issues on which many would like to see much less deceptive greenwash and much more genuine investment, in free home insulation to cut energy consumption and bills for example.",

We proposed climate emergency declarations in June + July 2019 for Deal TC, Walmer PC and Dover TC to become net zero carbon emitters by 2025 with honest carbon auditing. People power filled council chambers and our proposals got passed! We welcomed DDC in Jan 2020 when it voted through a Climate emergency to become a net zero carbon organisation by 2030. But . . . currently DDC and KCC targets for DDC council area and Kent look at a distant 2050 targets, hence ‘aim higher’.\nB\nWe want DDC and KCC to respect grassroots community climate campaign groups and BUILD partnerships. In Kent where one party is dominant on 9 of 12 District councils (which all use the single-party cabinet system), all policy is decided by 9 x 7 persons = 63 portfolio holders of a single political party, one which rarely disagrees with central government, a party that tends to recognise medium and large businesses as stakeholders, but which rarely accepts views of councillors of other parties, and rarely recognises community groups and small businesses as stakeholders, because of Kent’s democratic deficit. (94% of its MPs are Conservative but only 40% of 1.3m electorate voted Conservative in 2019). Stroud DC’s Climate Strategy includes two-way dialogue between the district council and the umbrella group, Climate Action Stroud, and this is a model we want to see developed in Kent and in Dover.\nC\nWe want KCC and DDC to COMMUNICATE better with the public and make sure that consultations involve a much higher proportion of the public, so that the rapid change that climate & ecological emergency action involves can be implemented in ways which communities think is workable and effective and socially just. With more council honesty and openness will come greater public trust and then more public willingness to shift to low-carbon lifestyles, we believe.\nD\nWe want KCC to DIVEST from fossil fuels (stranded assets) in relation to their multimillion pound pension fund investments. How can councils recognise the climate emergency yet ignore the impact of their multi-million pound pension fund investments in polluting fossil fuel companies, in pesticides and big pharma? We ask the outgoing Conservative KCC councillors who were elected in 2017, why haven’t you done this on your watch?

The letter says the govt will push through further planning consent using a Special Development Order, and promises robust mitigation with light buffers and air pollution monitors. But distrust of such promises prevails in Guston. The clearance facility plans to open 1stJuly 2021 at which point Manston Airport, Thanet, will no longer be used as a temporary border clearance site.\n2 months earlier, on 21st Oct, the Labour opposition at Dover District put a motion, (voted through unanimously with Conservative support and a couple of amendments) to force the ministry to disclose their plans and level with Dover District population and Guston villagers about the border clearance plans, after the minister had refused to answer DDC councillors’ questions earlier.\nIn fact, concerns have been growing since July 2020 when a whistleblower revealed to Bloomberg the site of the clearance park on arable fields between Dover Leisure Centre at Whitfield and Guston village next to a road bridge spanning the non-dualled A2.\nGuston is one of the most charming, best governed parishes in East Kent with the popular Chance Inn, a prize-winning recreation area, the historic St Martin’s church, a beautiful solar-paneled village hall, and a solar farm. Many residents choose to live there for the peace and quiet and the beautiful walks down into Dover town including the North Downs Way (or ‘Roman Way’). Furious residents, say their lives will be ‘slaughtered’ by the ‘completely undemocratic’ imposition of the Inland Border facility on the edge of Guston. Mr Mick Palmer, resident and ex-HGV driver, said, “Never has a country treated its people so badly, They have told lie after lie after lie. They will have to have floodlights and power points for refrigerated lorries, which means generators going all night.” Guston Parish Council is quoted publicly as saying, ‘it is actively working to prevent such a development” and is taking legal advice.\nSarah Gleave, representing Dover and Deal Green Party, said, ‘ it’s clear the central Conservative government in London don’t give even half a hoot for residents of Dover district, who were promised frictionless freight flow. Everyone in Dover district deserves so much better than this. The government, and Ms Elphicke, Dover’s MP, are denying the horrific impact this clearance facility will have on Guston people and the whole area, they are saying suck up the new jobs created by new red tape. But we were told in an FoI reply from DDC that DDC economic forecasters have no idea if there will be any net jobs gain when the job losses to our tourism, staycation and exporting sectors arising from traffic and border problems are set against new jobs which may be created by clearance agencies. The Kent Downs AONB curls round Dover, metres away from the location of this site, and farming, food production in our district is important post-Brexit. Far too little thought and local consultation has gone into this government decision. DDC cabinet and KCC have been noticeable absent in offering support to Guston Parish Council’.\nTo complicate matters, Dover District and Kent County Councils plans for the site, are to run a new road across the same fields so that a new ‘Fast-track bus and cycle route’ can allow commuters in the soon-to-be expanded village of Whitfield to catch trains at Dover Priory Station and leave the car at home. But this makes locals wonder if at any point, during new dual carriage-way A2 construction for example, the new bus route might temporarily be pushed into service for HGVs. In a response to a Freedom of information request (from Green Party campaigner, Sarah Gleave), KCC -Kent County Council – said this would not happen and all HVGs would use Jubilee Way, A2 and the junction with A256 to the B &Q roundabout. Residents around Deal who use the Duke of York’s roundabout (junction A2 / A258), are expecting traffic jams to arise when and if imports and exports pick up post-Brexit, as lorries come up from the docks, park up for clearance and port health procedures and then either head on up the A2 towards Canterbury or return down to Dover to join the A20/M20. Will the shops and Leisure Centre in White Cliffs Business Park experience a drop off in trade if locals choose to go elsewhere because of such traffic jams ?\nA drop-in, Covid-compliant protest against the lorry park was held on 3rd Oct, and publicised when the Dover and Deal Green Party activists leafleted villages letting residents know of the government plans. Estimates of the capacity of the Inland Border facility range from 671 to 1200.",

Two schools in Deal and two schools in Dover indicated higher than these levels.\nOn 12 March 2019, Deal school leaders and councillors were encouraged to adopt a range of initiatives to help reduce pollution. These included:\n- raising awareness amongst parents and carers\n- ‘green screens’ and ‘living walls’ around schools\n- closing school streets to vehicles at school drop-off times\n- expanding the cycle network\n- additional tree and shrub planting in public spaces.\nA small action that all drivers can take to improve local air quality is to turn the engine off when stationary – for example when waiting at level crossings.\nhttps://www.kentonline.co.uk/deal/news/green-partys-plan-to-improve-157894/",

We agree also with Prince Charles who has called the policy ‘appalling’.\nEven if the flight on 14 June did not happen because enough responsible people were able to use the rule of international law at the last minute, we need to continue the struggle to make this reprehensible UK government revert to a more moral, workable and compassionate policy.\nThe Rwanda flights policy does not punish or dissuade people traffickers, who profit from misery. It drives their victims, fleeing conflict, to self-harm and suicide. Safe routes, processing of applications 20 or 30 miles from Dover, across the channel, would reduce criminality.

This conversation flagged up various issues regarding the selection of the White Cliffs business park, Dover District’s only retail park, (and a site next door to the new, expensive Dover Leisure Centre), to become Dover’s Inland Border Facility.\n- There was good reason to expect that the junction of A2 and A258 at the top of Jubilee Way, (the Duke of York’s roundabout) would suffer traffic jams, tail-backs to Deal, and accidents, with resulting problems for many residents across the district (and Port of Dover employees), because HGVs can’t be stacked on a non-dualled A2 north of Eastern Docks, if DfT insisted on ignoring local advice, and fails to shift the location to a site further inland up the A2 (where A2 dualled) which would be safer in terms of traffic and less damaging to the local economy.\n- The East Cliff bridge / aka Jubilee Way, the non-dualled flyover bringing traffic up from Eastern docks to the undualled A2, had been fit for purpose in the 1970s, but this was no longer the case.\n- People at POD, had ‘very grave doubts’ about the safety of the junction from the A256 onto the A2 also. This is where the port-bound slip road from the A256 joins a 100 metre dualled section of the A2 before the A2 becomes single carriageway to go under the B-road Guston bridge over the A2, effectively 3 lanes becoming 1 lane in a 100 metre stretch of road. ‘It is a wonder a serious road accident hasn’t happened this week with the traffic building up again’, as HGVs drivers, who’d had their Covid test at Manston, were shepherded down to Eastern Docks.\n- In terms of resilience and flexibility of freight flow (to allow emergency vehicles through, etc), POD people believe that both the A20 IBF at Sevington and the A2 IBF somewhere near Dover, should have the capacity and staffing to do all forms of clearance and vehicle checks necessary, (biosecurity, port health, DEFRA issues and other), so that freight flow could be switched if necessary. If the Dover IBF were re-located along the A2, NW of Whitfield, north of the sections of non-dualled A2, this would reduce the time HGVs would spend rolling up and down Dover hills, in residential areas; shorten Dover dwell-time in Highways-speak.\n- The safest option, in opinion of POD source, to save residents of Dover and its outlying villages of Whitfield and Guston, would be to invest in a new dualled bypass to swing north round Whitfield (which DDC plans to enlarge), round luxury Richmond Park development, round Guston to re-join Jubilee Way and A2.\n- This 4th week of January, ro-ro traffic has picked up to be only 10% down on the same week last year, and so POD are not too worried at losing trade to the new direct Ireland/ France ferries, because being only daily sailings, the long Rosslare – Dunkirk route doesn’t offer the flexibility of Dover where there are many more sailings per day.\nAnother well-informed source, Kent County councillor Geoff Lymer, has suggested a different alternative site at Tilmanstone ex colliery site, just off the roundabout north of Whitfield on the dualled A256, near Tilmanstone Salads, and said ‘at least at this site, trucks could be stacked on the inside lane without holding up local traffic, and the geology means there would be less risk of sink-holes appearing than at the White Cliffs site’.\nEven though London government’s Department for Transport are pushing through their ill-judged plan at break-neck pace using a Special Development Order, more and more local people are writing to the Local Planning Authority, DDC, and councillors, begging for DDC to insist on the Environmental Impact Assessment of the White Cliffs site that DfT want to dodge, especially because the land is subject to flooding which overflows onto the non-dualled A2 at that point. Few local people believe government’s claim that they only want the land for 5 years to build the IBF on, and then it will disappear in a puff of smoke. Guston Parish Council have taken on a legal team with specialist and local knowledge to defend their desperately unhappy residents.\nOn Tuesday 26th January, Deal Town Council voted unanimously to send in objections to DfT about the siting of the IBF and ask that it be re-located, thus joining St Margaret’s Parish Council and Langdon Parish Council who have done the same.\nGreen cllr Mike Eddy said, “It is evident to everyone in the district that residents in Deal, Walmer and all of the villages and the small businesses that depend on our great green tourism economy will suffer if govt pushes ahead, in this ignorant fashion.The stay-cation economy on which jobs depend stretching from Deal, through the campsites and holiday parks of villages and coast, up to NT visitor centre at White Cliffs, and EH Dover Castle all depend on the Duke of York’s junction mentioned above.”\nAll 10 Green Party town and parish councillors across the district jointly sent in a protest to the undersecretary of Transport, Rachel Maclean MP on 20th January.\nSarah Gleave said, “We’re coming together across the district to do everything we can, to stand up to ill-informed bullies in Government. Nobody in Dover District deserves to have their lives wrecked, by losing the green hills they love, their right to the quiet enjoyment of their homes and surroundings, or by suffering a road accident. Diesel fumes will not be good for the lungs of anybody, especially not the teenagers in the 2 secondary schools which will have the IBF on their doorstep. I’ve had people in tears about the injustice, the secretive, bullying way that government and, sadly, Dover’s MP, are shoving this site down local throats and washing their hands of the problem that they’ve created and failed to plan for, or consult on, making people a prisoner in their own home.”\nGleave added, “Scores of people have asked me how they can protest safely under the lockdown restrictions that the government are taking advantage of, the village of Guston petition has almost 2000 signatures. I’ve had retail managers at the retail park tell me they are expecting a drop- off in trade because people won’t want to risk traffic accidents or traffic jam. A well-informed local Border Force officer told me, yes colleagues of his are due to be working on trades clearance at the Dover IBF, and yes they do privately think choosing the White Cliffs business and retail park is very ill-advised, and that the IBF should be re-located. We need DDC conservative cabinet members to show backbone and to force government to show Dover some respect and select a less damaging location for the Dover IBF.”\nAt Dover DC meeting on 27th January 2021, Leader of Opposition, Labour cllr Kevin Mills referred to further gridlock like that of Christmas week will arise from the siting of IBF whose proximity to the port was a problem, and to the ‘details that have not been provided to the council by DfT, details urgently needed so that DDC could formulate an adequate planning response. He said DfT are driving this through under an SDO and the district council are going into this blindfolded and with at least one hand tied behind our backs. The residents don’t believe for one moment they’ve been given fair treatment by DfT in London.’ DDC are holding an Extraordinary meeting on 9th Feb 2021 the day before DfT ‘engagement process’ ends on 10th Feb, the date was extended.\nFurther reading:",

We Greens warned of the failure of the current Conservative leaders to protect British residents and plan for mass installation of home-produced renewable energy using existing technology we can see with our own eyes. Sensible warnings were made about the failure to reduce the energy bills and energy needs of ordinary folk by insulating all homes, new and old. Food security ?

The change included an end to Kent’s district councils; to be replaced with huge Unitary Authorities (UA), with 3 or 4 UAs to cover all of Kent.\nConservative leader of Kent County Council (KCC) Mr Gough, led his obedient Conservative councillors to vote on 9 January 2025 to end KCC, and to end our Kent district councils. Central government did not put Kent on the fast track for these sweeping changes, so our KCC election wasn’t cancelled.\nWe Green Party councillors and campaigners across Kent, and East Kent especially, protested loudly on 9th January and at parliament on 30th January. Because we believe reorganisation that takes voices away from communities is change for the worse, not change for the better.\nThe proposal is for PLANNING to be taken from district councils, a.k.a. local planning authorities, to become the responsibility of a future ‘mayoral strategic authority’. The voting arrangements for a new Kent mayor, under discussion currently, favour lobby-laden parties with money.\nWill this help the garden of England? Will it protect our vital food-growing fields and orchards? We doubt it. We believe that reorganisation that favours bigger, more lobby-laden parties needs to be rethought.\nDover, Thanet, Folkestone & Hythe, Canterbury and Ashford have over 720,000 residents, and are the half of Kent that is most hard hit by austerity and the cost of living crisis. We believe that if all 5 East Kent district councils are lumped into one council / Unitary Authority area, with little funding to restore council services and redress the awful impoverishment we see on our doorsteps, this may well be change for the worse.\nWe suggest the change wouldn’t be so bad if East Kent were to be two Unitary Authorities: Dover, Thanet and Canterbury in one, Folkestone, Hythe and Ashford, Swale East in the other. It would result in less loss of voter voice, less loss of democratic accountability.\nThe shape of reorganisation on the table in April 2025 needs a LOT of improvement to become change that redresses social injustice in East Kent.\nWe Green Party KCC candidates and campaigners in Dover district are determined to speak up against a fake devolution, that makes things worse; to speak up for genuine devolution that empowers districts and communities in East Kent and pushes central government into restoring the funding that councils have lost over the 18 years since the banking crisis.",

We include in this manifesto ways we would work to address these problems. We believe that the compact and congested towns of Deal, Walmer, Sandwich and some parts of residential Dover would benefit from having ’20 is plenty where people live’ and ‘Living Streets’ / low traffic neighbourhood policies brought in. BUT we deplore the over-hasty, KCC cabinet- imposed, imposition of fake (sometimes dangerous) cycle routes and traffic calming schemes with ZERO dialogue, collaboration, consultation with local East Kent communities. To be effective, innovation MUST involve citizens and communities.\nWe have been campaigning for Dover to catch up with Ashford and Maistone as regards EV charging points since 2018 and welcome the partnership between KCC and DDC and parish councils so that the rollout of EV charging points is now happening at last in the Gateway to England. We applaud the work of CPRE Kent and the Kent Cycle and Active Travel Campaign Group on these issues.\nTransport and Infrastructure Plans in Dover District.\nStrangely Dover District Council’s draft NewLocal Plan (consultation Jan – March 2021) didn’t have ANY specific strategic policy on walking and cycling infrastructure, especially given that cycle routes 1, 2, 15, 16, and 17 run through Dover District and East Kent. It only had a vague promise on “enhanced network of dedicated walking and cycling routes”.\nWe note that despite the statement in DDC nLP about ‘proposals generating levels and types of traffic movement resulting in severe cumulative residual impacts in terms of capacity and road safety will not be permitted’, DDC accepted the Dept For Transport’s imposition by SDO of the Dover IBF using non-dualled A2 route used by many retail shoppers at White cliffs Business park, and thus has permitted exactly the problem described. The real-world constraints of the EK road system (A258, A2, A256) mean little can be done to ameliorate the situation, without long term road closures needed to dual the A2 from Jubilee Way to Lydden Hill, which will stop the flow of freight to IBF. But road improvements to separate local traffic from through freight traffic must be done to save lives; road improvements that central govt must pay for,(even though Kent CC allowed Dept for Transport to off-load responsibility for Dover IBF on to KCC on 18 March 2021). The Director of Kent Highways MUST ENSURE that the separation needed, includes flyovers, foot + cycle + bridlepath bridges and underpasses.\nIt should be noted that Dover has far too much experience of the gridlock and chaos caused by cross-channel delays, especially the community of Aycliffe, (and Guston may soon suffer similar blight). With more extreme weather events expected, and with ‘frictionless freight flow’ now a thing of the past, holding areas for freight OUTSIDE THIS DISTRICT, near the M25, are needed more now than they were before.\nOur Green team, which included 2 councillors elected to Dover Town council in 2019, have put the following suggestions forward at DoverTC;\n- Port of Dover to be approached regarding more solar PV on their buildings and the installation of wind turbines on the harbour walls like the ports of Boulogne and Liverpool,\n- Eurotunnel to be approached about wind turbines on the Samphire Hoe breakwaters,\n- Network rail to be approached about solar PV on Dover priory station buildings,\n- similarly for Stagecoach and the planned new bus station at York street.\n- We also recommend high solar canopies over the marshalling yards of Port of Dover, to generate energy that fridge trucks (whose engine-idling contaminates Dover) could plug into while waiting to board ferries. Because the poor air quality due to freight has an appalling effect on air quality and walkers, cyclists and residents of Dover town are the victims of this air pollution.\nLINKS RAIL – CYCLING – BUSES – SAFE WALKING\nWe were shocked that DDC draft new Local plan made NO comment on the need to integrate active travel / cycling with rail stations across the district.\nWe recommend(ed) adding specific mention of the rail stations in the district which are (HS1 Line Ashford – Ramsgate) Dover Priory, Martin Mill, Walmer, Deal, Sandwich, and (Dover – Canterbury East – Victoria line) Dover Priory, Kearsney, Shepherds Well, Snowdown, Aylesham. There is also a fast bus route No 12 Deal, Whitfield (south of A2, separated by A2 from Whitfield Urban Development), Canterbury. Enhancement of the network of walking and cycling routes promised must include installation of engineered, protected, dutch-style cycles paths, improvements of junctions in towns across the district especially near rail stations, and integration of cycle paths 1, 2, 15, 16 and 17 with all these 9 rail stations and 4 bus stations (Dover, Deal, Whitfield Sandwich). Trains and buses on these routes must agree to carry (electric + cargo) bikes, in trailers if necessary.\nWe recommend the protection of the safe Skylark Way cycle route on the back B roads from Dover to Deal via Guston + Martin, (put in following the tragic death of an 18 year old cyclist) and urge that signage on this route be better maintained.\nWe note the ON /OFF status of the Dover or Whitfield fast-track this winter, as Dept for Transport plans for Dover IBF have fluctuated. We welcome a dedicated new road just for bus / cycle, and an electric, not diesel, bus service to transport Whitfield residents to Dover town and Dover Priory rail station and to discourage reliance on private cars, on the condition that it does not reduce walking and cycling opportunities for residents of Rokesley ward, Dover and Guston, is something we welcome. Thankfully, cyclists on Fast Track being encouraged to use Dover IBF road used by HGV vehicles seems now to have been ruled out, and must continue to be so. We urge council leaders to respect and discuss innovations in this location with local parish councils and local residents to a MUCH greater extent.\nWe hope that DDC Cabinet uphold their own statements on Highway Network and Highway Safety in the future.\nWe proposed that the following wording replaces the final sentence in order to clarify levels of significance or severity of increased traffic: “A Travel Plan or Transport Assessment will be required for all residential developments of more than 15 units, the requirements of which will be secured by planning conditions, Section 106 agreement or through the Community Infrastructure Levy as is appropriate.”\nRoad improvements (especially on the A2, A20 and A256) to separate local traffic from through freight traffic must be done to save lives. These are road improvements that central govt must pay for , especially as regards the protection of areas of large housing development (cited in DDC Strategic policies 4 Whitfield, 5+6 Aylesham and 7 Elvington and Eythorne). The separation needed must include flyovers and underpasses for local traffic.\nImprovements to the highway network must also include underpasses for (electric) bikes and real dutch-style, protected cycle-paths so that cycling commuters from Whitfield can get safely to Kearsney rail station and Martin Mill Station. There should be a safe, engineered, dedicated cyclepath from Aylesham Station to Elvington, and another from Elvington to Shepherds Well rail station\nSafe kerbed pavements must be provided running from bus stops on A roads to any new development of 8 homes or more in rural village settlements to prevent old and young being trapped by car dependence up unsafe B-roads, which costs KCC money for taxis from schools, (see Kent active travel strategy ). Applicants must demonstrate that their plan includes installing and cost of installation of the protected cycle-paths and kerbed pavements described above. Dept for Transport consultation Feb 2021 on trends in innovation in rural transport is relevant.\nDevelopment of green tourism, walking and cycling in Dover District.\nThe Conservatives currently in power at Dover District and Kent County councils have recently talked up plans they have in this area.\nThe cable car to the castle, and the cost to the public purse of both the feasibility study and the cable car itself are very unsustainable. It is unsustainable because the degree to which cruise ships will return to popularity post-covid has a question-mark over it and consequently the idea of wafting passengers from the cruise terminal to the castle so they don’t have the inconvenience of pottering through Dover town is also an expensive shot in the dark. It would be much better to look at smaller zero-carbon transport activity projects within the town; harbour trips with zero carbon, solar-powered boats (like La Rochelle has had for 15 years), like electric hopper mini-buses (like the ones which have been coping with the 1 in 6 gradients of Aix-en-Provence for over 10 years).\nDeal Town Centre. The relative success of Deal Town Centre is threatened by the congestion caused by over-development on the outskirts of Deal / Walmer. With many developments still in the planning and building stage, this congestion should be anticipated from early 2023. Shoppers aged 50 – 90 will not want to sit in traffic queues to get to Deal Market on a Saturday, they will go elsewhere perhaps to Canterbury or to Thanet retail parks.\nDeal Town Council’s report of June 2020 ‘Making Walking and Cycling irresistible’ is excellent, our Green cllrs on this council fully endorse it. It provides detailed junction plans to make cycling safer and we fully endorse it and suggest Sandwich TC and Dover TC may wish to prepare plans for improving junctions of a similar nature. The plan for a ‘Park and Pedal’, scheme at Borrowpit Carpark, Walmer, is excellent. It would offer opportunities to SMEs to provide small electric hopper bus(es), or pedal-buses (picture below) .\nThis should be provided by a local CIC in preference to Stagecoach, who, experience shows, are disinclined to innovate in a timely fashion, and it could allow Deal town centre to retain footfall on the High Street and cope with the developments which have already received planning permission, or are being built. We support the pedestrianisation of Deal High street, which has been popular with many during lockdown (if not with a handful of oldschool shopkeepers) .\nWe fully endorse the application by DealTC for ‘Walkers are welcome’ status. We note our Green Cllrs on Walmer Parish council are involved both with the roll-out of EV charging points and with the provision of high security cycle lockers at Walmer Station.\nThe Deal / Walmer road system will not cope if permission is given for any more developments. DDC dept of Planning, Regeneration and Development are in danger of killing a Dealite goose laying golden eggs, if they don’t put a brake on developments within 3 miles of the boundaries of Deal / Walmer.\nBetteshanger Park (was Fowlmead) has long been a Kent attraction for cycling and this should continue. The oldest cyclepath in Britain runs from the Betteshager Park back to Sholden and Deal. We are told it was built by Italian prisoners of war for the colliers working at Betteshanger to cycle back home to Mill Hill. This cycle route is currently under threat from 21/00402, a Greenfield development of 117 dwellings on Sholden Downs. We oppose this development and believe the valley bottom below the site should provide natural connectivity to Ham Fen and Ramsar areas to the north.\nParking Provision on new Developments : to comply with the Kent and Medway Energy and Low Emissions Strategy, applicants should limit off-street parking to space for a maximum of 2 cars per dwelling. Obviously we fully support polies to provide Open Space, Playing Pitch strategy, Protection of Open Space and Community Facilities on new developments so that walking around ones neighbourhood is pleasurable , We recommended the retention and protection of existing woodland as community amenity (buildings or land or woodland) .\nDigital Technology . All new out-of-town developments should include co-working spaces, with cycle parking and car club options. (There are areas of the district where ‘superfast broadband’ connections must be improved . Currently they are so slow (especially during lockdown with added use of bandwidth) that residents have been preventing from accessing the consultation portal).",

Cutting fuel poverty by making all the homes within our existing East Kent towns healthy and cheap-to-heat matters just as much. We Green campaigners did a door-to-door survey before Christmas in Sholden’s older and newer streets and 90% of the people we heard from said ‘we have enough housing already’. So the Mercury’s front page story of Richborough Estates taking the decision on 155 extra dwellings to the Planning Inspectorate shines more light on what is wrong with planning.\nThe local Green Party submitted a detailed alternative Local Plan in 24 pages, in Dec 2022 saying how we needed to transform existing homes, and build 5-10 times as much new council housing, (32 new properties are not so many). Download a PDF of our submission. We emphasized how much we need to protect wildlife habitats given the devastating fall in wildlife numbers, and protect farmland to grow our food on. We emphasized how much our district needs restoration & improvement of our lost public services and better public transport.\nIn our Local Plan submission we said, ‘The policy of Dover Urban Area having nil provision of affordable housing is both unsound and non-legally compliant. Moreover the reality is that during the life of the last Local Plan, Deal / Walmer experienced 30% more housing development than was planned. So this policy would only be sound if it were amended as follows: In the case of planning applications on developments of over 8 dwellings on windfall development sites, within 3 miles of the outer boundaries of Deal / Walmer, permission will only be given if the developer applicant has previously undertaken a development of a similar scale within Dover Urban area which provides a minimum of 30% affordable housing.’\nVery many people tell us they want a better, cleaner, less lobby-laden planning system. We need a DDC planning department and more planning committee councillors who do not prioritise property developer partners and their 30% profit margins, councillors who respect residents and voters more than monied lobby groups.\nDDC is running a Housing Needs Survey until 7 March. There are 5 short parts to it, in the 5th part we can each say what housing we DON’T need as well as what housing we need. We urge folks to take part. We also applaud the Deal Society for organizing an event on Feb 28 at the Landmark Centre at 7.30pm on town planning and what we can do as local citizens, and note that the Facebook page of SEDDD Stop Exploitative Developers in Dover District is getting more attention.\nNationally, there is a government consultation from now until March 2nd on the National Planning Policy Framework (which councillors are legally bound to comply with) and there is excellent guidance from the Community Planning Alliance on how to respond.

I’m happy to live, work and bring up my family in Dover, which has so much to offer in terms of its history, beautiful natural environment and vibrant community spirit.\nHaving moved to Dover 20 years ago, I have developed a deep fondness for the town and have worked hard to contribute to our community. In 2015 I worked with a team of committed volunteers to set up the group ‘Transition Dover’, part of the Transition Town network. We bring people together on grassroots projects including creating more green spaces for wildlife and running Dover Repair Café for 6 years now.\nSo many people are struggling and it isn’t right. Green councillors are pushing hard for a fairer Kent. As a parent and an experienced teacher, I want to ensure our children can grow up in an environment that is safe and healthy. A town that offers them opportunities for secure housing and employment. They deserve education that prepares them for a changing future and our schools require adequate funding and support to make this happen.\nWe need clean, cheap public transport, well-maintained roads and safe cycle-paths and pavements for pushchairs, people and walking frames. We need clean, green energy that cuts energy bills and gives our country energy security.\nKent is crying out for real change, for kindness, for investment in jobs in a well-being economy. I would speak up for Dover and make sure our corner of Kent cannot be ignored. Please vote Green in 2025.”\nVoters in all wards of Dover, including Melbourne Ave, Aycliffe and River will see Liz’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nSandwich and villageS\nPeteR Findley\nI am proud to be a candidate in Sandwich and villages. I’m known across East Kent as a wildlife and countryside campaigner and it takes up a lot of my time since I retired from the Kent Specialist Teaching Service.\nI’m one of the many who volunteer in the community, where I’ve served as a school governor, and more recently as a trustee of Gazen Salts Nature Reserve and of Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory. Since 2023 I have also been a councillor on both Walmer and Deal Town Councils.\nMy interests include surveying wildlife on a Nature Friendly Farming Network farm on the Ash Levels. I love this corner of Kent where I’ve lived, worked and raised my family.\nI’m dedicated to making it the best it can be for local people now and in the future. I am known locally for speaking up and writing against environmental and social injustices. We must get enough funding for KCC child and adult social services, move the Making Space for Nature project forward and improve rural bus services. All of us will benefit from a fairer and more resilient Kent. Please vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in Eastry, Ash, Goodnestone, Preston, Sandwich, Staple, East Stourmouth, Wingham, Woodnesborough and Worth will see Peter’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nDover North VILLAGES\nSarah Waite Gleave\nThe new KCC council of 2025 will have a voice in shaping sweeping local government changes. Ministers in London want planning to be centralised in Maidstone under a new Kent mayoral authority.\nIn the villages of Dover North we need to protect our food-growing fields, our wildlife habitats. The district needs to build the cheap-to-heat, low energy homes, in the right places close to services, to be sold or rented at genuinely affordable prices to solve the housing crisis.\nAs a planning spokesperson for our local party, I worked on our 25 page submission on the DDC Local Plan. I met many parish level campaigners at the hearings in November 2023. Planning decisions must be made close to the communities who have local knowledge of traffic and land use. And be subject to scrutiny. If elected I will stand up for this principle on all occasions.\nI’ve campaigned here since 2009, and have served as a parish councillor twice since 2017. I have often spoken up on highways, safe pavements, protection of woodland and green spaces.\nI am very concerned by central government plans to make 5 East Kent councils into one, in the half of Kent with highest need, and lowest tax raising capacity. I was at protests in Maidstone and the House of Lords to ask for better in January 2025.\nEast Kent deserves more from KCC than 15 years of Conservative cuts to services, sadly cuts to councils continue under Labour. I would work for a fairer, more resilient Kent so we can help end the cost of living crisis. Please vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in Aylesham, Great Mongeham, Guston, East Langdon, Nonington, Northbourne, Ringwould, Kingsdown, Ripple, St Margaret’s, Sutton and Tilmanstone will see Sarah’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nDover West Villages\nNick Shread\nI’m delighted to announce that I will be the Green Party’s candidate in my home town for the KCC elections on Thursday May 1st.\nI live in a village in the Dover West KCC division and know well the concerns of our communities.\nI’ve been a hard-working Town Councillor in Dover since 2023, and this year I was extremely pleased to bring my Motion for the Ocean before the council. Aiming to ensure closer community links with the sea, the motion looks to support initiatives which embrace our unique location.\nI would be delighted to have the opportunity to support the local community more, with the additional resources and influence afforded to County Councillors. Please vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in Alkham, Capel-le-ferne, Denton, Wootton, Eythorne, Elvington, West Hougham, Lydden, Shepherdswell, Temple Ewell and Whitfield will see Nick’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.",

  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_elphickes-jump-proof-we-need-cleaner-green-housing-planning-policies/content_56.html": "What was especially sickening in news of Elphicke’s defection to Labour, was to hear that Elphicke ‘has been offered a role advising Labour on housing’ (BBC-SE TV 6pm). So self-interest from Elphicke, a new low in UK politics. Her welcome from Keir Starmer doesn’t reflect well on the Labour front bench either.\nGreen Party MP candidate, Christine Oliver, pointed out, ‘This was cynical behaviour bringing UK political system into disrepute, from died-in-the-wool, hard-right, ERG, Conservative-until-yesterday, Ms Elphicke MP, and from Labour leader of the opposition. The UK needs people and parties who will restore public faith and cleaner government, make our political system more democratic, more accountable, instead of what we saw on 8th May 2024.’ Poor, poor Dover and Deal constituents deserve so much better than Charlie (jailed for sexual assault in 2020) and Natalie Elphicke, a disgraceful couple this constituency has suffered since 2010, 14 years ago. A number of Conservatives are known to have left their party, when Ms Elphicke was selected in a rush in November 2019.\nNatalie Elphicke is well known locally for being very unavailable to constituents, unless a fawning photo-call is promised. We see no link on her website for constituents to email her, no public access to her X/Twitter account, so many constituents palmed off with emails signed ‘office of Natalie Elphicke, MP’, and a very shut door to her Conservative constituency office in Walmer.\nWe have an inequality crisis in housing. Those suffering sky-high rents / mortgages are NOT helped by empowerment of a property developer lobby that likes to buy influence in govt, to achieve 20-30% profit margins. Developers do this by ignoring, shrugging-off planning conditions requiring them to build ‘30% affordable homes’ to focus on executive investment properties built on much needed farmland, especially in Kent. This can no longer be hidden by xenophobic, victim-blaming.\nThe Right homes; in the right place; at the right price is the Green Party policy.\nThe Green Party’s plan would create hundreds of thousands of high-quality affordable homes as well as protecting renters and keeping homes in the community for good. This would be done by :\n- Bringing in rent controls and end no-fault evictions (Con Party made promises in 2019 but failed to deliver on ending no-fault evictions)\n- Pushing for 150,000 new council homes a year to end the affordable housing crisis\n- Ending ‘right-to-buy’, and thus enabling local authorities to keep council homes available and affordable in the community for good.\nRight homes; right place; right price Green housing policy means homes that are energy efficient and cheap-to-heat, close to services, public transport and green spaces which are affordable to rent or buy. Dover and Deal Green Party worked harder than any other to try to get these commitments into the Dover district new local plan. Other parties were conspicuous by their absence.\nTo achieve these policies means cleaning up the UK planning system; electing people and parties who will say ‘no’ to being bought by big corporate lobbies, even if it means making appeals to the general public to help them fund campaigns. The property development lobby, was in a headline in Financial Times in July 2021, ‘Property sector donations rise to quarter of all funds gifted to Tories’.\nThe story of Ms Elphicke MP leaving a sinking ship on 8 May 2024, having tired of being an MP, begs the question, is the property sector’s lobbying money now switching to Starmer-led Labour ? Will the property development lobby be allowed, under a Starmer govt, to block new regulations to make all new homes properly energy efficient as this sector got away with in 2017 under the Conservatives ?\nAND, will Dover and Deal voters find out about, and be attracted to, the better, cleaner housing policies of the Green Party in 2024?",

There seems to be a idea going round that this Conservative UK government is ‘in power because a majority of voters wished it to be so.’ Some fact-checking shows this is far from the truth.\nIn the UK in December 2019, there were 47,074,800 registered voters out of a population of 66.8 million of all ages. Of those registered to vote, 31,681,340 actually voted, and only 43.6% of those who voted, chose to vote Conservative, 13,813,064, very far from a majority. In Kent, in Dec 2019, 1,322,347 (1.3million) were registered to vote, and 532,342 voted Conservative across Kent’s 17 constituencies, again a minority of 40%.\nBut because of a rotten, out-dated, non-proportional, voting system, 43.6% of the UK vote produced an unaccountable 56% of MPs. And in Kent, 40% of our electorate voted Conservative, produced 94% of Kent ‘s 17 MPs toeing the Johnson line.\nIf you think this is unfair, lots of UK folks of all parties and none, agree with you. More and more are calling for a better, fairer, more proportional voting system in UK and a much more accountable government, with less crony profiteering. The owners of most of the big national papers won’t tell you that. But the facts show most voters dislike the oppressive right-wing bubble.",

The petition calls on the Mayor and Town Clerk of Dover Town Council to work with Dover District Council to put in more toilets.\nIn Oct 2020 it was announced that £1.5m would be invested post Covid in a Dover cable car. We say it is ridiculous to plan to invest £1.5million on a cable car in a town which has no public toilets near the only coach park in town. Everyone knows that coach companies plan their excursions round suitable comfort breaks. Obviously £1.5million would be better spent on 3 installations of good public toilets, one to be installed by 1 June 2021 in the Maison Dieu Car / Coach park. What is the point of Dover town having 2 KCC cllrs (Con), 8 District cllrs (6 Lab+2Con) and 17 Town cllrs (8 Lab) if together they cannot install a couple of new modern public toilets?\nhttps://www.change.org/p/mayor-and-clerk-of-dover-town-council-more-public-toilets-for-dover-town\nKeith Sansum said, “It is a disgrace that Dover, the gateway to England, has less than half as many public toilets compared with Deal and Walmer. Communities in Dover, people with babies and toddlers, and OAPs have been crying out for Dover Town to have more toilets for years. We won’t be palmed off with half measures and it isn’t good enough for Dover Town Council to say they are trying to find businesses who will let some people come in sometimes to use their loos.\nSarah Gleave said, “Whether we are in lockdown or not, Dover needs modern self-cleaning toilets. Because historic Dover needs to be a healthy 21st century town too. Walking and cycling shot up during lockdown. More Dovorians want to walk and cycle too, but we can’t if we are worried about being caught short. The lack of loos makes it very difficult for people without cars, it discourages walking; or the bushes become unhygienic. Our 2 Green town councillors have suggested a doubling or trebling of public toilets in Dover town, but experience shows it will need a public petition and a lot of community campaigning for action to happen.\nVictoria Pasquino of The Allotment restaurant said, “I run the Allotment restaurant opposite the Town Hall and I get inundated with people asking if they can use our toilet. I refuse as I’ve had loo rolls stolen and mess and I’m on a water meter. This has only started since the public toilets behind the town hall shut, when I also noticed other restaurants and cafes putting signs in the window saying toilets are for customer use only.\nNick Shread said, “Dover needs regeneration and visitors. Why not invest in 3 or 4 good self-cleaning toilets. If Maison Dieu Coach Park became the site of one set of good public toilets, coach visitors could stop for an hours’ comfort break, visit our lovely Dover Town Hall –the Maison Dieu, and visit London Road’s shops and cafes. Visitors could spend pennies and pounds in Dover Town centre. Promises were made over 2 years ago, this matter is urgent. Dovorians are still waiting with crossed legs. “",

With banners and a ‘die-in’ the campaigners (from East Kent Climate Action, from Transition Town Dover, Sandwich Environmental Conservation Group) were there to show support for two questions from the public being put to the new Labour Leader of the Council, Councillor Kevin Mills. The questions were submitted to DDC and asked by Christine Oliver & Sarah Waite-Gleave, Green Party members and climate campaigners in Dover district. Christine Oliver is also the Green Party PPC for the Dover constituency.\nChristine Oliver asked:\nWill DDC leaders support the Climate & Ecology Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 10 May? It is a vital, new, cross-party proposal-drafted by world-leading scientists-to ensure that the UK plays its full role in tackling biodiversity loss and climate change? There is a gap between what is currently being delivered-and what the Government needs to do to act in line with the latest science. The Climate and Ecology Bill, or CE Bill, would:\n1) Provide a clear, joined-up plan-the crises in climate and nature are deeply intertwined, requiring a plan that considers both together. Reduce UK emissions in line with the Paris Agreement-ensuring that UK emissions are reduced rapidly, for the best chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C.\n2) Halt and reverse the decline in nature-setting nature measurably on the path to recovery by 2030, as agreed at COP15.\n3) Ensure that the UK takes responsibility for our overseas footprint-both emissions and ecological.\n4) Involve the public-giving people a say in finding a fair way forward through a ‘climate and nature assembly’.\nSarah Waite-Gleave asked:\nWill the new DDC leadership heed the call of Dover district’s many climate concerned citizens, to replace the closeted Climate Change PAG with a more publicly accountable working group involving representatives from all parties represented on the district’s town councils, and community and civil society representatives, in order to take the urgently needed large-scale actions on the conjoined cost-of-energy, climate and nature crises, so that, in partnership, the net zero target for the whole district may be brought forward from 2050 to 2035 ?\nReplying to Ms Oliver, about the Climate & Ecology Bill, the Leader of the Council, Cllr Mills, replied that yes he supported the Climate & Ecology Bill, a private members bill which has cross party support in the House of Commons, that the threats to local communities and the world are critical. Pushed by Christine Oliver to say if his side of the chamber would put a motion of support for DDC to formally support the Bill at the next DDC meeting in October, Cllr Mills said yes Ms Oliver should sent details of the model motion and his group would propose it to the Council.\nReplying to Ms Waite-Gleave about the setting up of a more publicly accountable and collaborative working group (or partnership) to get the whole district to net zero before 2050; Cllr Mills said he did see the need for an improvement on the unaccountable PAG arrangement set up by the previous Conservative administration, he would like to involve those of other parties from town councils with relevant knowledge / experience in the new structure, and he would be talking to the portfolio holder whose responsibilities include climate change, to bring this about. He also pointed out that there was a natural limit to the size of a group if it was to work effectively and make timely decisions.\nSarah Waite-Gleave commented; On behalf of the climate concerned across our coastal district, we welcome these promises for a better chance of working together to get urgent work done, especially on fuel poverty. We hope these promises will be firmed up at the next meeting of DDC, in October which we will be attending.",
  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_greens-push-for-action-on-po-ferries/content_182.html": "At the meeting of Deal Town Council on 19 April, a member of the public made an impassioned plea for stronger action on the summary dismissal of P&O Ferries staff and their replacement with agency staff on lower wages. His plea comes in two parts (both reproduced below) – one a written submission and the other a statement read out at the meeting.\nGreen Party councillor, Mike Eddy, proposed that the Council should demand the re-instatement of the sacked staff, expressing the council’s disgust and anger at the way in which the sackings were done; that crewing levels should be increased to fully satisfy safety levels; that P&O Ferries should be nationalised as traffic to and from Europe is vital to the nation’s economy; and that facilities for drivers hoping to use the port of Dover should have decent facilities in place as soon as there are hold-ups in the Channel for whatever reason.\nCllr Eddy’s proposal was supported by the Council though Labour’s Deputy Mayor abstained. The Mayor of Deal will be writing to the Government, the County Council and District Council to get some meaningful action to support the local community and the national economy.\nWritten Statement to Deal Town Council 19 April full council meeting from a member of the public\nWith reference to the report by County Councillors Bond and Murphy regarding the P&O situation (Item 14, Attachment 11), it is unlikely in my view that P&O Ferries will be able to operate at full capacity until new tonnage is brought in. All P&O ferries should be fully crewed with mariners who are fully qualified to carry out their roles in an emergency. It is not acceptable, for example, to have a crew member from the galley allocated to both fire-fighting in the galley and at the same time allocated to dealing with the lifeboats on deck. The issues of vessel seaworthiness and muster lists are down to the Maritime and Coastguard Inspectorate and we have to wait until they are fully satisfied with the safety of the vessels sailing from Dover, as no-one wants to see another Herald disaster.\nIn the meantime, we in this district have the serious problem of how to deal with the tailbacks of lorries and holiday-makers. It is damning that there is still no provision of toilet facilities for drivers on the M20 and that the county councillors are simply talking in their report of seeking additional funding from Government for the clean-up of the verges. The damage to Dover and the country’s reputation has already been done. So has the damage to public health, just as we are coming out of a pandemic.\nI would ask Deal Town Council to press DDC, KCC and the local MP to do more than express “concern regarding P&O’s actions”. Those bodies should be expressing their disgust at the way mariners have been treated by the company and expressing their disgust at the way in which drivers are being treated by government as they wait for P&O to behave like reasonable employers and competent service providers.\nAdditional Comments by the member of the public at the Meeting\nMembers will already have read, I hope, the public statement about the P&O situation, referred to in the county councillors’ report (Item 14, Attachment 11). That report goes on to outline some of the benefits of working with partners on the other side of the Channel. But to be taken seriously as partners we have to show that we want communications between this country and the rest of Europe to be efficient and well-run, with ferries which are fully crewed with fully trained crew members.\nAs for a Jobs Fair some time later this month, I doubt if that will be of any consolation to those mariners who have been sacked with 30 minutes’ notice. A statement of the government’s intention to take P&O into public ownership and to re-instate all those sacked would be more helpful.",

Gladmans was the company that put in two planning applications to Dover District Council for 80 houses off the Dover Road in Walmer and for 100 houses at Cross Road in Deal.\nBoth sites sit on top of the aquifer and so will interfere with local water supply and surface water run-off. The Cross Road site, which was given approval on the casting vote of the chairman of the Planning Committee meeting, is accessed by two single-track country lanes (Ellen’s Road and Cross Road) – expect chaos if these houses are ever built.\nAt the end of the article is a brief post-script, which quotes Daniel Gladman’s comments in a high court case five years ago. Apparently he said:\n“We … target local authorities whose planning is in … disarray and vulnerable to quick application for a suitable site.”",

As a member of the party who has long had a lot of control at DDC, why does Mr Jull want more control in Walmer?\nExamination of cllr Jull’s text: the wording of the original is in italics. The reality is in bold type.\nREALITY: The only information that identifies this as a Conservative leaflet is the blue in the title, the use, once in the text, of the word Conservative and the statement that it was promoted by Keith Single on behalf of Peter Jull, both of 54 The Strand.\nMost people would not know that Keith Single is the Conservative election agent, that Peter Jull was elected a Conservative DDC councillor in 2019, and a WTC cllr in 2021 and that 54 The Strand is the Conservative Party office in Walmer. Why is this leaflet not more explicit about who it is from ?\nQuote: Since the last elections for Walmer dominant GREEN councillors have:\nREALITY: There are three (3) Green Party councillors on Walmer Town Council out of a full complement of 15. There are three (3) card-carrying Conservatives and two (2) former Conservatives. The rest, 7, are Independent (1 ex-Labour). No party dominated between 2019 and 2023, there was a considerable degree of cooperation.\nQuote: Ignored a parish consultation and borrowed £1/4million to buy a house which still needs another £100,000 spending on it to make it useful as council offices.\nThere was an advisory survey split 50:50; the whole Council saw the results and agreed to acquire a publicly-owned asset, a functional office with room for committee meetings; the whole council passed the full results of the advisory survey on to the Public Works Loan Board, which agreed with the purchase and approved the loan.\nThe loan was made at a rate of 1.5%, fixed for 20 years. The building had already been converted into offices by the previous occupant.\nThe figure of £100,000 is far in excess of reality. Planned changes to the building will save on energy bills, improve security and fire safety, add a disabled access and provide a committee meeting room, all of which were lacking at the previous premises.\nQuote: Incompetently mishandled the process of disposing of a commercial lease on the existing office leading to delays costing £000s in additional property payments.\nREALITY : Negotiations have been blocked time and again by the Conservative ex-Vice chair (in 2013) of WalmerPC, the landlady of the unsatisfactory premises at 8 The Strand, to such an extent that the landlady may well be in breach of the lease, and WTC would be justified in ceasing to make any further payments. All negotiations have been undertaken by the council’s staff competently and it is unacceptable for Cllr Jull to pretend otherwise.\nA potential new tenant, who passed all the due diligence tests, was identified but the landlady of the property delayed progress so long that the potential tenants withdrew.\nOn the suggestion of Conservative Cllr Peter Jull, the Council engaged Tersons to find a new tenant, which they did. Again the landlady and her lawyers have put this transfer of the lease at risk through their repeated delaying of the matter.\nQuote : Attempted to pass the blame onto the Conservative councillors with vexatious disciplinary action in excess of their legal powers even though the responsible Monitoring Officer found there was no wrongdoing, risking £0,000s of public money on futile judicial review costs.\nREALITY: The original lease was entered into in 2013 and was agreed between the then Conservative Chairman of the Council and his Conservative Vice-Chairman, who was and is the landlady of the property, 8 The Strand. Legal advice on the terms of the lease were sought by the Council. When provided and paid for, the advice was ignored by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman.\nApart from the rent of £6,000 per year, some £26,000 was spent by the Conservative controlled council on refurbishing the property owned by Conservative Vice-chair/ landlady plus another £18,000 to put in heating. All the details of this dubious arrangement have been published on the Council’s website following a vote in full council, Feb 2022.\nThe Monitoring Officer at Conservative controlled DDC took the view that the dodgy deal had taken place so long ago that it was outside his remit. The Nolan principles on behaviour in public life says “They [holders of public office] should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.” The public-spirited 2019-2023 Walmer Council and all 3 persons who have chaired it (cllr Lechevalier, cllr Murray, cllr Eddy) have all sought to uphold the Nolan principles, and substitute a publicly-owned asset, for a lease that would never become an asset except for the landlady, one of the Conservative leaders of council in 2013.\nThe only truthful statement in this Jull fiction is that public money was put at risk by a futile judicial review, which was brought by Conservative Cllr Pat Heath, the 2013 Chairman of the Council against the 2019-2023 Council.\nQuote: Created toxic relationships which have seen 2/3 of staff and over ½ of councillors resign so they could co-opt their cronies onto the council.\nREALITY: In 2019 there were 3 part-time staff. One moved to take up the post of Town Clerk at a council in Thanet and the other moved to job with a legal practice in Canterbury, career reasons not reasons of toxicity. The third is still with the council. Of the councillors, 3 resigned during lockdown as they were working in the NHS or the care sector. A Green Party councillor resigned to take up a job in Bristol, and an independent councillor resigned because he moved out of Walmer. Understandable reasons.\nCo-options were dealt through a rigorous recruitment process which required CVs and interviews undertaken by a panel of 3 councillors – and independent, a former Conservative and a Green, markedly less one-party domination than prior to 2019. The Conservatives have called two by-elections at a cost of some £7,000.\nQuote: Increased the staff wage bill from £48,000 to £100,000 per year.\nREALITY : The wage bill has increased, as the council has become more of a can-do council maintaining the busy schedule of events and bringing in new services for residents, and standing up to DDC planning dept, (recommending to DDC the protection of Walmer from overdevelopment) as we went through Local Plan consultation, and pressing KCC for road safety measures. There used to be 3 part-time staff servicing the council’s committees, and the wage bill was less than the sum paid to Dover District Council for cleaning the public toilets in the town.\nThere is now the equivalent of 3 full-time staff dedicated to delivering services for residents, and the bill for the toilets has been reduced through tough negotiations, so that some new staffing costs are offset using this saving.\nQuote: Tried to throw the rugby club off the Drill Field which would lead to houses being built there.\nREALITY: This is untrue. The Council and the rugby club have recently concluded a Heads of Agreement for a new 30-year lease for the club and both sides have instructed lawyers to finalise the lease. The only members of the council to speak of building on the land have been two Conservative councillors.\nQuote : Can you afford to allow these people back onto your local Council? Vote to restore Walmer to the exemplar (sic) council it was before 201\nREALITY: Can Walmer residents afford cllrs who think insider deals/ leases for friends, that are in breach of the Nolan principles, are acceptable, cllrs who claim their party needs full control of a local council? Variety and multi-party collaboration seems a lot healthier, allowing for the prevention of one-party domination and insider deals.\nSince 2019, collaboration between mostly Independent and 3 Green councillors has seen, among other things:\nThe introduction of electric vehicle charging points (with a £4,000 grant from Kent County Council);\nThe current construction of secure cycle storage at Walmer station (bringing in some £45,000 of investment into the town);\nThe introduction of a new standing order in 2019 to ensure the chairmanship rotates every 2 years, so that no single person stays in power for so long that they come to regard the council as theirs to command.\nAnd the popular thermal imaging camera service to help residents save money on energy.\n9 non-Green and 3 Green cllrs voted on 2nd Feb 2022, to refer the report on the lease of 8 the Strand to the authorities, to make the report public (it is on the Walmer TC website now under ‘recent posts’) and to seek to recoup costs. This is evidence that most fair-minded Walmer councillors) except for Cllr Jull, did not regard the Walmer council prior to 2019, as exemplary.\nThese matters were discussed at the Annual public meeting on 19th April 2023, an informative and pleasant occasion when Cllr Eddy was complemented on his chairing of the meeting; Cllr Jull was not able to attend. We suggest to Cllr Jull that he might find it useful to re-read the Defamation Act 2013.",

The leader of DDC is already heralding this ‘tremendous news’ as recognition of the need to ‘level up Dover as the UK’s gateway town.’\nIt has taken 6 years and the very real danger of losing seats in local elections in Kent for the Conservative government to do something to solve the cross-channel traffic problems that cause misery to local people. They caused the problem by taking the UK out of the European Union but whatever your feelings on that particular issue, all the research and studies predicted serious border holdups post-Brexit.\nClearly money should have been made available to mitigate this, preferably before but certainly after we left the EU. The Conservatives have failed to do this at every opportunity! In 2020 the government denied funding from the £200 million UK Port Infrastructure Fund for a £33.5 million project to build more passport check points. The Port of Dover had to resort to a legal challenge of the decision. Where was the recognition of Dover as the UK’s gateway town then?\nNow, Conservatives are throwing considerably less money than is needed at the issue, whilst trying to convince local people that they care. We won’t be fooled. The money is intended to ‘improve the flow of traffic from the UK to the EU, with more border control points and a new exit route to help the port operate more efficiently and reduce congestion on local roads.’ This isn’t ‘levelling up’ a disadvantaged and left behind area, this is providing critical infrastructure for the UK at its most vital trade Port. Dover handles £144bn of trade in goods and 33% of the UK’s trade with the EU, supporting the UK economy. Of course the government should be investing in it.\nHow far will £45 million go towards easing the traffic chaos we all know and hate? It costs somewhere between of £20 million and £60 million to construct a mile of dual carriage way. This is many, many days late and and many dollars short. It represents nothing more than a sticking plaster, but offers some good publicity for the Conservatives who are running scared.\nWe welcome the money that is being made available to Dover Town for the Bench Street regeneration that is so necessary. We hope that the positive impacts of that regeneration won’t be lost amidst lanes of lorries and cars belching out diesel fumes into the new parklet.\nChristine OliverParliamentary Spokesperson for Dover and Deal Green Party",

We should stop creating greenhouse gasses and move to renewables.\nFracking is dangerous. We live on chalk lands and the noxious chemicals will probably get into our water table.\nIt causes earthquakes which result in large cracks in buildings – currently work in Lancashire is suspended if an earthquake over 0.5 intensity on the Richter scale is recorded – now firms involved in fracking want these standards diluted to avoid continuous work stoppages.\nThe Netherlands permitted fracking with similar ‘safeguards’. The result – so much structural damage to homes that fracking has been completely banned.

He recommended that £200,000 of the DDC reserves be invested, half in the 19/20 budget and half in the 20/21 budget, for the investment in a 100 panel solar car park canopy so that DDC could cut fuel emissions and cut fuel costs, and so that the next fleet of DDC vehicles could be recharged from the canopy.\nMike Eddy said:\n“We were glad that both the Leader of the Council, Cllr Morris and the Leader of the Opposition, Cllr Mills, at Dover District Council accepted the principle of the Green Party’s budget amendment. For a relatively small investment, we can save something like £25,000 per year. We can put the savings on the Council’s electricity bill towards investment in electric council vehicles and electric charging points. This is a win-win for council tax payers. It is unfortunate that we can’t get on with this straightaway. We are in a climate emergency after all. But the commitment from two major parties means we should get there soon. ”\nExamples of actions that have been taken elsewhere and which could be taken in Dover District which were referred to at the Council meeting included:\n- Section 106 agreements for any new-build out-of-town developments to discourage 2 and 3 car ownership by forcing developers to include electric car clubs and cycle and walking paths (as has been done in Woking).\n- Bus Rapid Transit schemes using newer cleaner vehicles to discourage private car use.\n- Refitting social housing and fitting solar panels so that tenants have lower fuel bills (as Kirklees Borough Council have done on hundreds of homes – as Mid-Devon District Council have done also).\nQuestion to leader put by Sarah Gleave of Dover and Deal Green Party:\n“Young people and their parents in Dover District are aware we have just 12 years to avoid catastrophic climate change by limiting global warming to below 1.5°C.\nSir David Attenbrough and the IPCC report make this plain. By the time young Dovorians grow up it will be too late.\nIt is worse than when KCC said some years ago, ‘Climate change is likely to affect flood risk through sea level rise, more frequent and higher storm surges, increased winter rainfall, drier summers with periods of more intense summer rainfall’.\nProblems elsewhere will also come to Dover’s shoreline.\nAs councils across Britain like Bristol, Hastings, Scarborough and Oxford step up to the plate, will Dover District Council commit to doing everything within the Council’s power to make Dover district carbon neutral by 2030 and press the Government to provide the necessary powers and resources to make the 2030 target possible? “\nA recording of the meeting includes quotes from the Leader of DDC Councillor Morris:\n“Climate change is regrettably likely to become the defining issue of 21st century, . . . world is on track to overshoot the Paris agreements 1.5degree C limit . . . . much more action needed.\nDistrict council is playing an active role and looking to do more. Over recent months DDC Officers have been working with Kent colleagues on Draft energy and low emissions strategy for Kent and Medway, which aims to . . . reduce carbon emissions creating a more sustainable energy infrastructure in Kent and Medway. ” .. “We’ve introduced electric vehicle charging points at new leisure centre and are requiring developers to do the same with charging points as shown at St James and Lidl.” . . We’ve converted lighting in offices to LED and during the coming year we will be converting all street lights to LED.\nI have noted with interest the decisions being taken across the country by various councils, and I will ask our officers to prepare a report for cabinet looking at whether we should do the same.”\nCheap Bus Rapid Transport – “Council is very keen to make this as green as possible, maybe with electric vehicles.”",

The article in Dover Express on 5 May said plans include the sourcing of alternative fuels, utilization of renewable energy sources, port electrification, off-setting (we hope planted off-setting will be in Kent), minimizing carbon emissions in procurement and development projects working with the community and supply chains and customers.\nWe applaud Port of Dover and Mr Bannister all the more, given that they are making these commitments after being dealt such a lousy set of cards in recent years by a less than competent set of Conservative ministers.\nIn April 2020, two Green Councillors on Dover Town Council, Cllr Sawbridge and Cllr Garnett, submitted four pages of detailed suggestions for the DoverTC ‘Ambition Plan’. Their suggestions included for Dover Town Council to send a letter to Port of Dover to ask about:\n- Plans for the Port truck and car parking areas to be made ‘non-engine-idling zones’, to include infrastructure for fridge trucks to plug-in to electric chargers,\n- Plans to put solar PV on top of Port buildings and to install wind turbines on the harbour walls like the ports of Boulogne and Liverpool,\n- For Dover TC to invite community energy enterprises (such as Kent Community Energy and Big Solar Coop / Share Energy) to speak to Council about how they could encourage community owned renewable energy projects on business and larger (public) buildings in Dover,\n- For solar-powered boat trips of our port to be facilitated via Destination Dover (like those that have been so successful in La Rochelle for 25 years). On another occasion we have also asked for NO2 air quality monitoring to be done at the port and the results shared with PCS and RMT union officials, and publicly.\nSo we send appreciation once again to Port of Dover officers for their carbon zero bid. With only seven and a half years before 2030, there will be lots of Dover residents keen both to talk constructively to Port of Dover about their plans, and to see the evidence of carbon zero plans taking shape soon.\nBeccy Sawbridge, Nick Shread & Sarah Gleave",

Our expert clearance sources say, automated clearance means a couple of hundred clearance jobs from the red tape that is making British exporters’ & importers jobs much more difficult, is the maximum to be expected and training will take a minimum of 6 months.\nMrs Elphicke treats Dover voters as mugs when she pretends that she has ‘worked hard to ensure residents voices have been listened to’.\nThe Conservative (DDC & KCC) Press statement has not one mention of the resolution of 18 March 2021 (KCC Environment & Transport committee) whereby KCC was/ is to take over the leading role on Dover IBF from DfTransport. The statement 2/7 has not a single guarantee about any limitation on the numbers of trucks on either the White Cliffs Site or the Dover Town site, or about central govt bearing all the costs of both clearance sites and all additional infrastructure (not dumping cost on Kent tax payers).\nOn 2nd July, the determined, exemplary representatives of Guston Parish Council were informed by Cabinet Office (and have on 6 July made public to local residents),\n- that DEFRA & port health checks will not take place at White Cliffs but a site with land for animals will be found in the port town (does this exist ?)\n- White Cliffs retail park can expect a clearance facility to be designed and run by HMRC for 1000 HGVs on the western edge of the site (closer to Christchurch Academy and Dover Leisure Centre) on a quarter of the land hitherto considered, with construction to start summer 2022 (does this imply road works to upgrade A2 to dual-carriage in the 12 months before then, summer 2021 onwards?)\nIn Dover Town, the expansion at Motis FSA who do clearance and provide a much needed healthy truck stop for drivers has been very welcome in recent years. But there is not the space for it to expand within the port town. The lack of space and the promise that Dover Western Docks Revival (which benefitted from £40 million EU money) would not be reclaiming land from the sea just to park + clear hundreds of trucks on has been repeated for years. Are the powerful in London, who seem to plan for Dover over long lunches in wine-bars, unaware of these realities?\nDover is crying out for investment in serious long-term, living-wage jobs, in a town where 35% of children live in poverty and these jobs should be coming from investment to make all Dover town’s homes healthy and cheap- to- heat. ITV has exposed the reality of Britain’s damp and mouldy homes, private rented or socially rented. Dover suffers problems like these and needs sustained, long-term public investment in JOBS to build new healthy low-cost urban homes & to refurbish homes.\nITV’s Joel Hills has exposed the problems of food delivery shortages because of huge shortages of HGV drivers.https://www.itv.com/news/2021-07-01/government-told-uk-faces-summer-of-disruption-to-food-supplies-unless-it-addresses-shortage-of-hgv-drivers There is talk of the army needing to be called in to drive food around.\nDover Farmers are very aware of the problems of lack of pickers for fruit and veg and of the problems that the Australia / Uk trade deal represents for British food and farming standards; evidence of a drop in our UK food security.\nDover + Kent Conservative councillors, & Ms Elphicke are taking deception to new heights in this press release, when they bleat on about high food standards and the same job opportunities they have referred to since Oct 2020 when they admitted to knowing of these central govt plans (published July 2020).\nThe reality is far different from the ‘victory’ the MP and DDC boast of. UNITE union have shown how our valued HGV drivers are bearing the brunt in Kent. Last month PCS union spokesperson for SE Border Force has said that his border force colleagues are at breaking point, and it is well known that the UK govt has failed to provide functional IT systems needed to manage UK borders. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-57638584also https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/09/home-office-failure-to-digitise-border-system-will-cost-extra-173m-says-nao\nAny DDC, or Kent, councillor, any MP, who denies this evidence, is trying to pull a fast one; we Dovorians smell double trouble ahead.",

But the more we examine it, the more we listen to members of the public and civil society groups who have scrutinised it, the more we compare it to national guidelines on what to look for in a climate-friendly Local Plan; the more it disappoints. We have a number of recommendations which would cause the Development Management (DM Policies) in subsequent sections to match the promises in Chapter 4 and make them meaningful, faced as we are by a triple crisis, of pandemic impoverishment, climate crisis and the 6th mass extinction as referred to by Sir David Attenborough, and so many others. Our recommendations are based on work being done by other Local Planning Authorities, new levels of public scrutiny (e.g. in the ‘Permission Accomplished’ 2020 Transparency Intl UK report on LPAs, planning and volume developers’ relationships) and advice from many local and / or professional experts, all of whom we thank most sincerely. In terms of the Reg 18 consultation process, which was decided before Christmas 2020 was curtailed, before the 3rd covid lockdown was announced on 4th Jan 2021, we and many members of the public are aware that 7 of the 8 weeks of the consultation were under lockdown and members of public with reduced internet access (be they due to disability, lack of skills, lack of funds or lack of broadband) will have had little chance to engage with the process. The on-line Q + A sessions were useful up to a point, it would have been nice if the use of language had shown that the planning department’s regard for its developer partners, was matched with a regard for the residents to whom democratic local planning authorities LPAs are accountable. It is unfortunate to say the least that the participation in the nLP process of community representatives, such as Dover Forum KALC, the Dover Society and The Deal Society was dispensed with in the year preceding the Reg 18 consultation. Chapter 4 item 3.11 We note that the words used by the ‘Planning, Regeneration and Development’ department refer to ‘a strategy and action plan with an aspiration that the Council will become a net zero carbon emitter by 2030’ are weaker that those minuted 29 Jan 2020, when Cllr Barlett (leader) moved, and Cllr Mills (leader of opposition) seconded the declaration of a Climate Emergency, declaring council would produce ‘a Climate Change Strategy with the intention of the Council becoming a net zero carbon emitter by 2030 at the latest.’ (item 52). We recommend that DDC Planning, Regeneration and Development department respect the words of the minuted democratic decision, instead of watering it down. (We would also meekly point out that our Green team initiated 3 climate emergency declarations for local councils to become genuine net zero carbon 2025 in June and July 2019 (Deal 25 June, Walmer 3 July, Dover 17 July) when we won 11 seats on DealTC, Walmer PC, DoverTC and Ringwould with KingsdownPC). Item 3.5 We note that internal migrants to Dover are likely to be middle-aged and older, and will probably require (as the local aging population does), small bungalows rather than executive 4 bedroomed homes, for people driven out of Greater London by the corruption of the London property market (report 2018 Transparency Intl UK, Faulty Towers). Item 3.17 We note that there was a gross imbalance 2010 – 2019 with lower housing growth where it is urgently needed in Dover (29%) and overdevelopment on Greenfield around Deal/Walmer urban area (31%) and Aylesham. There is concern that Deal / Walmer have seen 2019 – 2021 more planning permissions granted at a pace which is causing serious public concern about the ensuing serious congestion and drainage problems. Item 3.25 We suggest that there is also a considerable extent of hidden un / under / precarious employment in Dover. Three wards in Dover town area are in the 10% of most deprived wards in the country. Item 3.27. We note that Dover became a net exporter of labour 10 years ago and residents commute to Canterbury, Folkestone, Ashford and London. This has implications, and we recommend, a) that Planning + Regeneration + Development officers work rapidly to understand the local employment opportunities on rural farms and woodland within the district that are presented by the need for local food security, and agro-forestry. We provide more detailed recommendations in our comments on Chap 7 and the DDC Growth strategy. Green New Deal job strategies (originating in UK report in 2008), are being taken up in the USA at scale, at pace, in 2021. We also recommend, b) that where labour has not shifted to home-working in the post-covid context, clean commuter options are delivered speedily, (details in response to Chap 9). Item 3.31 and 3.32. The expected declarations of praise for, and promises to protect, the district’s natural environment are entirely appropriate. Its beauty and diversity underpin both our tourism economy and the wellbeing of 117,000 residents, AND food production is also dependent on biodiversity. There are missed opportunities to join up the dots linking Chap 5 and Chap 7 and Chap 11, and show a genuine understanding of how our existing natural capital is an essential and invaluable component without which it will be impossible to meet the climate change mitigation targets that we must meet if our children are not soon to live in deprivation and danger. (especially in a district whose 70% rural economy is well-placed to meet the needs of the post-brexit, climate emergency, post-covid world). Chapter 4 – Spectacular and Sustainable Environment To clarify: Mitigation of Climate change means taking action so that the level of climate change is less than it could become. Adaptation to climate change is different, it means taking action so that the expected problems of climate change can be better coped with. Bullet point 1 would make more sense if it were reworded thus, To respond to the climate change emergency through both mitigation, ensuring natural carbon sequestration assets are retained, ensuring the reduction of carbon emissions from existing housing, and minimising carbon emissions from new development; and also through adaptation, designing and regulating new developments to ensure they are resilient to extreme weather events and climate change. 2nd, 3, 4th 5th bullet points we commend. 6th bullet point should be amended thus, to ensure the depleted natural resources of the District are restored, that waste is minimised and environmental pollution is stopped. The Spectacular and Sustainable Environment should be the first of the 4 aspects of the Vision, followed by Vibrant Communities, then Thriving Places and finally a Prosperous Economy, as a prosperous economy can only be delivered with the other elements in place (para 4.1). Chapter 5 Climate Change The draft Local Plan lists as key climate change issues, a) reducing carbon emissions, b) sustainable design and construction, c) renewable and low carbon energy, d) sustainable transport, e) water resources, flood risk and coastal change, f) carbon sequestration. We comment on how these fleeting promises in chapter 5 can be made meaningful below in specific chapter sections, in chap 6 and 7 and 11, are recommendations on a), b) e) and f) ; in chap 9 are recommendations on c) and d). We note that with the announcement, March 2021 that ‘the Gulf stream is being slowed to a tipping point’, there is a need to expect both more extreme winters and more extreme summers. So item 5.9 needs to include both passive cooling in summer and passive warming in winter. 5.34 Change to The natural capital wealth of the district must not be thrown away because of unintended negative impacts of the cheap and cheerful land clearance practices of volume developers, and their sub-contractors. Existing trees and hedgerows which are capturing carbon in this decade 2020-2030 and the next 2030 -2040 must be protected. Vague promises ‘to facilitate tree planting and protection where possible’ are a very inadequate response, because replacing existing trees with trees that will only start their carbon capture career in 2040 will not increase our carbon sequestration capacity or allow the UK or Kent to meet its climate change targets. SP 1 Planning for Climate Change. Mitigation – bullet points to be changed; 1st ; Change ‘promoting’ to ‘requiring‘ low carbon design, 5th ; Change ‘Maximising’ to ‘retaining and maximising’, Add 7th ; ‘incentivising the reduction of carbon emissions from existing housing’ (because otherwise promise in Chap 3 will be unfulfilled.) DM Policy 1 Reducing Carbon Emissions. We note the list of councils building zero carbon homes includes; Exeter City Council, (200 finished, 1000 on the way), Leeds (1000 nearing completion), Norwich (100 finished), York, Wales (1400), Oxford (40), Enfield, Meridian Water development (10,000 homes). https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/06/eco-homes-become-hot-property-in-uks-zero-carbon-paradigm-shift So the draft wording of DDC nLPwe find very weak. We recommend this (closely based on ReadingBC Local Plan Adopted 2019). ‘Given the scale of residential development in Dover up to 2040, achieving the aims of the Climate Change Strategy will not be possible without that development having a minimal impact on carbon emissions. Therefore, the requirement will be that major new housing is built to zero carbon homes standard. A revised Sustainable Design and Construction SPD to be produced in 20xx will contain more detail on achieving this requirement, but in general, where homes are not designed to be carbon neutral, this will mean as a minimum a 35% improvement in the dwelling emission rate over the 2013 Building Regulations plus a contribution of £1,800 per tonne towards carbon offsetting within Dover (calculated as £60 per tonne over a 30 year period). Where it is proposed to meet the zero carbon homes requirement in another way, clear evidence should be provided to demonstrate how it will be achieved at planning application stage. Zero carbon homes is an achievable standard that, until recently, was intended to be a national requirement in the Building Regulations. And Non domestic buildings: Change ‘BREEAM very good’ to ‘BREEAM excellent’. DM Policy 2 Sustainable Design and construction. Add ‘Given the low cost of initial installation of rainwater harvesting, and the high cost of installation after homes are built, permission will be granted only if designs include the installation of rainwater harvesting (and greywater recycling). DM Policy 3 Renewable and low carbon energy – change to ‘Developments of renewable and low carbon energy will be supported and encouraged . . . e) impacts on heritage assets and landscape setting have been minimised, f) there is no significant impact on wildlife habitats, biodiversity (particularly protected species).’ DM Policy 4 Sustainable Travel. 4 (c) could be strengthened to read: “Be readily accessible by sustainable transport modes through the provision of high-quality, engineered, safe and direct walking and cycling routes within the permeable site layout..” This would make clear that cycle ways, for example, should be more than a painted line on the road surface. Also to be improved by the following final statement: “The Council will safeguard and enhance the rights of way network and other cycle and walking routes from developments that would otherwise compromise their use.” DM Policy 5 Water Efficiency. We recommend adding ‘the installation of rainwater harvesting systems is required on new build housing’ DM Policy 6 Flood risk. Add : Wetter winters are a feature of climate change, as are rising sea levels so more of the district (inland and on the coast) is likely to be at risk of flooding. Undeveloped valley bottoms within 3 miles of urban settlements should be left undeveloped both as a means of allowing natural means of flood prevention, and to prevent new homes from being flooded. DM Policy 7 Surface water management. We commend. DM Policy 8 Coastal Change Management. We commend. DM Policy 9 Tree planting and protection. We recommend that the points made in 5.64, 5.65, 5.66 become part of this DM 9 Tree Protection and replacement. Add ‘Existing trees which are capturing carbon in this decade 2020-2030 and the next 2030 -2040, must be protected. DDC will accelerate the rate of making Tree Preservation Orders and Woodland Preservation Orders and provide appropriate staffing and resources to sustainably and effectively deliver this policy, honest, independent evidence from an arboriculturalist will be required if felling is requested on grounds of tree disease. Vague promises ‘to facilitate tree planting and protection where possible’ are a very inadequate response, because replacing existing trees with trees that will only start their carbon capture career in 2040 will not allow the UK or Kent to meet its climate change targets. Moreover this addition is essential, ‘For every 10,000m2 of new housing (roughly 50 dwellings of 200m2 per dwelling) of housing, one open space of 150m2 and another woodland area of 150m2 should be provided, these allocations to be non-transferable between 10,000m2 sections. Moreover development should only be permitted if 90% of existing trees are retained (This will account for the woodland areas referred to above, and will provide pockets of green infrastructure of amenity value to new residents at very little cost and inconvenience to the developer). The Vibrant Communities statement in 3, “a supply of new homes that meets people’s needs and where affordable and local housing is prioritised”, does not seem to accord with much of the strategic policies 4, 5, 6, 7 and specifically it does not apply to the proposal to build houses over the catchment area of the aquifer to the south of Deal (DEA020), or a number of similar proposals, or with the scale of internal migration into the area as shown in Chapter 3 (Figs 3.2 and 3.3). We reject item 6.50 entirely. Strategic Policy 2 Housing Growth – We note that a bullying central government in London is imposing a disproportionate amount of housing growth on Kent and the SE, that the supposed national new homes ombudsman, is not neutral in this matter and gets on well with volume developers and there is with a grievous lack of democratic accountability across Kent, and so the chances of protecting Kent, the garden of England, and of achieving a Growth Strategy that creates climate-friendly jobs and suitably-sized, suitably-priced zero-carbon homes for the next generation of local families are not good. The space available for infrastructure, functions well for a compact coastal towns of the size that Deal / Walmer + Sandwich was 3 years ago. The level of greenfield overdevelopment is putting Deal infrastructure under strain now, so in-fill should make up the majority of the allocations for Deal and that the housing growth specified for District Centre of Deal and around its boundaries needs to be radically reduced. Item 6.88 and its passing reference to settlement boundaries which will be reviewed some time soon, is something many of our correspondents are very concerned about. We recommend changing to ‘Previously existing settlement boundaries will be respected, until such time as town and parish councils may have agreed changes with Dover District Council, in accordance with the principles of localism.’ Strategic Policy 3 Residential Windfall Development Provision of affordable housing, item 6.50. We believe it is entirely unacceptable for DDC dept of PRD to say ‘for Dover urban area there will be no affordable housing to be provided’ because of our LP whole viability study. We note that https://www.labcwarranty.co.uk/media/2694/land-development-report.pdf shows that return on investment for developers in Kent is running at 29.34% . The vast majority of the public in Dover district (whether they are among the 35% of the electorate who are engaged enough currently in the work of councils to vote or not), are keen for Dover urban area to get the warm, healthy, affordable homes that it is crying out for. They do not want to see desirable Deal/ Walmer urban area become so congested that its desirability disappears. We therefore want to see an amendment in Strategic Policy 3 Residential Windfall Development as follows: In the case of planning applications on developments of over 8 dwellings on windfall development sites, within 3 miles of the boundaries of Deal / Walmer, permission will only be given if the developer applicant has previously undertaken a development of a similar scale within Dover Urban area which provides a minimum of 30% affordable housing. On Strategic Policy 4 Whitfield Urban Expansion : We note that the details will appear separately as a Supplementary Planning Document, but that a commitment is made to provide the new neighbourhood with transport (We recommend ‘transport’ should mean cheap affordable electric buses) education, primary health and social care, utility services and green infrastructure, with retail, leisure and employment venues. We want an amendment specifying how much green infrastructure; namely an amendment stating that for every 10,000m2 (roughly 50 dwellings of 200m2 per dwelling) of housing, one open space of 150m2 and another woodland area of 150m2 should be provided, these allocations to be non-transferable between 10,000m2 sections. Moreover development should only be permitted if 90% of existing trees are retained (These retained trees will account for the woodland areas referred to above, and will provide pockets of green infrastructure of amenity value to new residents at little cost or inconvenience to the developer) and new trees planted and tended with a guarantee to ensure survival 4 years after development completed. The same to apply to North and South Aylesham (Strategy Policies 5 + 6) and to Eythorne and Elvington Local Centre (Strategic Policy 7). On Site Allocations Policy 1 non-strategic housing allocations Key considerations. In all instances where it says existing trees should be retained where possible, this must be changed to 90 – 100% of existing trees must be retained The following sites we believe are the most threatening to local ways of life and are unsustainable in terms of commitments to climate and ecological emergency and should be omitted from the list; ASH10, DEA008, DEA020, DOV012, KIN002, LYD003, NOR005 rare open mosaic habitat, RIN004 (traffic lights + pedestrian crossing needed on A258) SHO002 +004, WAL002 Gypsy and Traveller Site Allocations – Site Allocation policy 2 Alkham Valley. We commend. DM Policy 10 Gypsy and Traveller site intensification. We support this policy DM Policy 11 Type and Mix of Housing – Affordable Housing 6.12 As stated above on Strategic Policy 3, we are entirely opposed to the strategy of Dover Urban Area nil provision of affordable housing. We therefore want to see an amendment in Strategic Policy 3 Residential Windfall Development as follows In the case of planning applications on developments of over 8 dwellings on windfall development sites, within 3 miles of the outer boundaries of Deal / Walmer, permission will only be given if the developer applicant has previously undertaken a development of a similar scale within Dover Urban area which provides a minimum of 30% affordable housing. DM Policy 12 Affordable housing. Sentence ‘This with the exception of Dover Urban Area . . . ‘ to be taken out. DM Policy 13 Rural local Housing Needs. Addition needed. ‘The work of Kent Community Housing Hub which provides a genuine alternative to developer-led housing schemes designed for high profit, will be brought to the attention of all of the District’s parish and town councils, as will the initiative of Shepherdswell and Coldred Community Land Trust’. DM Policy 14 Gypsy and Traveller Windfall Accommodation. No objection DM Policy 15 Self Build and Custom House Building. We welcome. DM Policy 16 Residential extensions and annexes. Add There should always be thorough and meaningful consultation with local residents. DM Policy 17 Houses in Multiple Occupation. No comment. Chapter 7 Employment and the Local Economy Future Economic Strategy. There appears to be no intention of using the Local Plan to improve educational attainment by, for example, specific policies to a) forge deeper links with FE institutions (such as the laudable, forward-looking Dover Technical College) given the skills gap relating to the Green Homes agenda, b) encourage higher education establishments to develop facilities in the district, and thereby to develop a knowledge based economy beyond the former Pfizer’s site. And c) encourage the long-promised incubation hubs for the newly qualified in the district, have fallen victim to central govt’s stop/start sound-byte culture, these a, b, c, should be a requirement. This would contribute to raising the average level of earnings in the district and to combating the high levels of deprivation experienced in some wards. A glaring omission relates to new economic opportunities created by climate-friendly recovery sectors. Three in particular are essential in Dover District. With a 70% rural economy, which is severely challenged by Brexit and climate problems including water shortage, our agricultural advisor tells us that diversification into agri-forestry could become popular among the farming community. It is recommended by Nature-Friendly Farming Network and featured on BBC Countryfile 28/2/21. Examples include a) protecting arable yields in cases of drought, by planted strips of suitable, native, drought-tolerant trees, (which counter soil erosion, while increasing carbon sequestration) and, b) bringing back to life existing but neglected, traditionally coppiced woodland, causing it to be harvested for biomass on a rotational basis. Similarly, short rotation forestry would create rural income and mitigate climate change. Another key to meeting climate targets is increasing the amount of land used for growing food for people rather than livestock. This would create new outdoor jobs as would replacing imported market-gardened food, (on which red-tape has increased) with locally grown fruit, vegetables and pulses, this is a growth sector too. So rural areas, fields and woodland should be valued as locations of employment in themselves. The second sector is the up-grading of all rented housing stock (both public and private sector) to zero homes standard, so that it doesn’t need to be done again before the target of 2040 /2050. It will be necessary to ensure that publicly owned rented housing stock stays in public hands. To incentivise private landlords, DDC should set up a register of private landlords, and to qualify for registration, landlords should have to show that homes rented are EPC C in 2022, EPC B in 2023, EPC A in 2024 and zero carbon in 2025. As this will push up the value of their property, landlords should not find it difficult to access cheap loans to carry out the retrofit and the council may be able to suggest sources of finance. Tenants will benefit in terms of heating costs saved and improved standards of health, which is also a saving to the public purse. The economy will benefit in terms of jobs created for local trades people. Although the Green Homes Grants scheme of central govt has caused problems among local retrofitting companies, creative schemes at the local level are well situated to get this urgent work underway, local municipal bonds are available as a means of pump-priming. A third sector would include the fitting and maintenance of renewable energy installations, e.g. small-scale on-shore wind, small and medium scale solar (on domestic or non-residential roofs or to be combined with grazing land), micro-tidal (tidal currents we are advised are very suitable locally), or ‘green gas’ as pioneered by Ecotricity in Hampshire (as the grass-cuttings from Dover’s many golf courses and campsites are likely to be suitable). To maintain the returns on investment in these sectors within the regional economy, and stop them being off-shored, a priority should be given to schemes which are 51% or more community-owned. Strategic Policy 8 Economic Growth. We recommend adding to the 2nd sentence so that it reads as follows; A higher level of jobs growth will be planned for, and land will be allocated to fully meet the needs that are identified; a priority will be given to the creation of jobs in the climate-friendly recovery sectors with land allocations designated for various forms of agri-forestry, market gardening, and renewable energy projects. Strategic Policy 9 Employment Allocations Needs the addition of farming land in Dover district because outdoor employment on the land as described above should be thought of as a place of employment. DM Policy 19 Retention of existing Employment sites – To the list should be added the farming land and neglected coppicing sites and other sites of outdoor rural employment. DM Policy 20 Loss or redevelopment of employment sites and premises DM Policy 21 Home working. We recommend adding ‘all large out-of-town developments should include of co-working spaces, (of interest to all parents who have had to work from home and home school during the pandemic), directly adjacent to car-club spaces and electric bike parking. DM Policy 22 Conversion or rebuild of rural buildings for Economic Dev. Purposes. This minor accommodation is welcome, allowing indoor office space. It has been cited by DDC officers when we ask about protecting the outdoor farmland and woodland as locations of employment; clearly office space and fields / woods serve different productive purposes. DM Policy 23 New Employment premises in the countryside . See comment on DM policy 22 DM Policy 24 Tourism and Tourist / Visitor Accommodation * The generalisations within this policy we commend, (See also opportunities for green tourist transport in Chapter 9) HOWEVER; Tourists have toilet needs. For a town with the iconic, historical importance of Dover NOT to have any coach park with lavatorial comfort facilities is a disgrace. The ratio of toilet block to inhabitant in Dover town is treble the ratio in other urban areas in the District, 1 : 10,000 or higher. The only coach park in Dover Town has, for 3 years, had 2 signs on Maison Dieu Road telling coach drivers and visiting cardrivers that a toilet exists when in fact it doesn’t. At this location in Maison Dieu car park, behind the police station, visitors get out, pay to park and find nothing, merely a sign to a 15 minute walk to Pencester Gardens, difficult when legs are crossed. The DDC website misleads the public on this issue. The lack of toilets is a public health problem which we have referred to Kent Director of Public health. The stalemate between DoverTC and DDC on this lack of toilets has to be overcome by installing a minimum of 3 modern self-cleaning toilet blocks, one at Maison Dieu, in 2021; in the interests of Dover residents, local visitors from around East Kent and tourists from further afield. The cable car to the castle, and the cost to the public purse of both the feasibility study and the cable car itself are very unsustainable. It is unsustainable because the degree to which cruise ships will return to popularity post-covid has a question-mark over it and consequently the idea of wafting passengers from the cruise terminal to the castle so they don’t have the inconvenience of pottering through Dover town is also an expensive shot in the dark. It would be much better to look at smaller zero-carbon transport activity projects within the town; harbour trips with zero carbon, solar-powered boats (like La Rochelle has had for 15 years), like electric hopper mini-buses (like the ones which have been coping with the 1 in 6 gradients of Aix-en-Provence for over 10 years). Chapter 8 Retail and Town Centres Dover Town Centre 8.32 All comments in DM Policy 24 Tourism and Tourist / Visitor Accommodation also apply here in Chapter 8 (acute lack of public toilets and services for coach tourists, unsustainability of cable car posturing, need for SMEs to provide zero carbon transport activities for visitors and day-trippers). Addition: there is an especial need in Dover for a cheap indoor hub for small start-ups such as that provided by the Co-innovationCentre at Stembrook (ex Co-op). If these premises cannot be made available for existing and new start-ups after 2021, a new location where costs are as low as they have been at Co-innovation should be provided. Dover Market around Market Square must be maintained and new stalls encouraged. Dover town spatially has much potential, it has long been overdependent on disparate, charitable initiatives. There is an especial need to incentivise retail start-ups along London Road, Dover between the Charlton Centre and the Cadet centre. Deal Town Centre 8.34 The relative success of Deal Town Centre is threatened by the congestion caused by over-development on the outskirts of Deal. With many developments still in the planning and building stage, this congestion should be anticipated from early 2023. Shoppers aged 50 – 90 will not want to sit in traffic queues to get to Deal Market on a Saturday, they will go elsewhere perhaps to Canterbury or to Thanet retail parks. Deal Town Council’s report of June 2020 ‘Making Walking and cycling irresistible’ is excellent, it provides details junction plans to make cycling safer and we fully endorse it. The plan for a ‘Park and Pedal’, scheme at Borrowpit Carpark Walmer is excellent. It would offer opportunities to SMEs to provide small electric hopper bus. This should be provided by a local CIC in preference to Stagecoach, who, experience shows, are disinclined to innovate in a timely fashion, and it could allow Deal town centre to retain footfall on the high street and cope with the developments which have already received planning permission, or are being built. The Deal / Walmer road system will not cope if permission is given for any more developments. DDC dept of Planning, Regeneration and Development are in danger of killing a Dealite goose laying golden eggs, if they don’t put a brake on developments within 3 miles of the boundaries of Deal / Walmer. Strategic Policy 10 Quantity and location of Retail Developments. No comment Strategic Policy 11 Dover Town Centre. There is a need for pleasurable, retail-browsing experiences; which means cutting business rates for independent, innovative start-ups especially those allowing residents to reduce their carbon footprint (zero-waste / re-fill shops, cycle + skate repair stores, up-cycling stores, plant swap-shops, etc). The Sunday farmers’ market could be tempted back all year round e.g. car park behind Costa coffee, if it were offered space under a solar canopy under which shoppers could stroll round protected from the worst of the rain. Walking / cycling / driving along London Road could become a much more cheering experience if offers to create murals along the road (from Dover Big Local, etc) were taken up. Underpinning the promotion of the town is the urgent installation of public toilets. The stalemate between DoverTC and DDC has to be overcome by installing a minimum of 3 modern self-cleaning toilet blocks, one at Maison Dieu, in 2021; in the interests of Dover residents, local visitors from around East Kent. Strategic Policy 12 Deal and Sandwich Town Centres. Both of these compact centres would benefit from ’20 is plenty’ policies being introduced. Protect the retail streets that exist. A strong case exists for incentivising / cutting business rates for independent, innovative start-ups especially those allowing residents to reduce their carbon footprint (zero-waste / re-fill shops, cycle + skate repair stores, up-cycling stores, plant swap-shops, etc). DM policy 25 Primary Shopping areas DM policy 26 Sequential test and impact assessment DM Policy 27 Local Centres DM Policy 28 Shop Fronts Chapter 9 Transport and Infrastructure It is strange that this chapter doesn’t have a specific SP on walking and cycling infrastructure, especially given that cycle routes 1, 2, 15, 16, and 17 run through the district. Chap 3 promises “enhanced network of dedicated walking and cycling routes”. It would be good to see more evidence that this is seriously being addressed in this chapter 9, see suggestions for improvement of SP13 below. Bus services should be better integrated with the rail service timetables on the line running from Sandwich and Deal through Dover to Ashford, and the line running from Dover to Canterbury and Faversham and Victoria. We note that despite the statement in SP 14 and DM 29 below about ‘proposals generating levels and types of traffic movement resulting in severe cumulative residual impacts in terms of capacity and road safety will not be permitted’, DDC accepted the Dept For Transport’s imposition by SDO of the Dover IBF using non-dualled A2 route used by many retail shoppers at White cliffs Business park, and thus has permitted exactly the problem described. The real-world constraints of the EK road system (A258, A2, A256) mean little can be done to ameliorate the situation, without long term road closures needed to dual the A2 from Jubilee Way to Lydden Hill, which will stop the flow of freight to IBF. But road improvements to separate local traffic from through freight traffic must be done to save lives; road improvements that central govt must pay for. The separation needed must include flyovers and underpasses. It should be noted that Dover has too much experience of the gridlock and chaos caused by cross-channel delays, especially the community of Aycliffe, (and Guston may soon suffer similar blight). With more extreme weather events expected, and with ‘frictionless freight flow’ now a thing of the past, holding areas for freight OUTSIDE THIS DISTRICT, near the M25, are needed more now than they were before. Given the mention in Chapter 3 of renewable and low carbon energy, it is strange that this infrastructure chapter doesn’t have a Strategic Policy on this issue. Our team, which included 2 councillors elected to Dover Town council in 2019, have put the following suggestions forward at DoverTC; Port of Dover to be approached regarding more solar PV on their buildings and the installation of wind turbines on the harbour walls like the ports of Boulogne and Liverpool, Eurotunnel to be approached about wind turbines on the Samphire Hoe breakwaters, Network rail to be approached about solar PV on Dover priory station buildings, similarly for Stagecoach and the planned new bus station at York street. We also recommend high solar canopies over the marshalling yards of Port of Dover, to generate energy that fridge trucks (whose engine-idling contaminates Dover) could plug into while waiting to board ferries. Strategic Policy 13 Infrastructure and Developer contributions Paragraph 9.26 highlights the need for infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure, and paragraphs 9.27 to 9.29 point out the difficulties of establishing what infrastructure is required to support each potential new development. Paragraph 9.30 concludes that infrastructure is best provided by Section 106 agreements rather than by a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This underpins Strategic Policy 13 which concludes by stating that “In determining the nature and scale of any provision, the Council will have regard to viability considerations and site-specific circumstances.” This statement, in effect and in practice, has allowed developers to reduce progressively the Section 106 payments and other conditions imposed on developments at the time of granting permission by suggesting that their potential developments are not financially viable once all the constraints have been factored in. A CIL would provide developers, planners and residents with the certainty of knowing what the community costs would be. It is not the Council’s role to have regard to any planning application’s financial viability. It is the responsibility of the applicant to have in place sufficient funding or access to sufficient funding in order to realise the project. It is the Council’s responsibility to determine the use of the land and the conditions which make that use appropriate. Paragraph 9.30 should be re-written to signal the Council’s intention to implement a CIL before the Plan has run a quarter of its projected course, and a further sentence should be added to SP13 stating that: “The Council intends to introduce a Community Infrastructure Levy as soon as possible but before 2025 so that the council, developers and residents can more clearly understand the financial requirements of any agreed planning permission.” Furthermore, in relation to SP 13 a new section needs to be added to the effect that the rail stations in the district are (HS1 Line Ashford – Ramsgate) Dover Priory, Martin Mill, Walmer, Deal, Sandwich, and (Dover – Canterbury East – Victoria line) Dover Priory, Kearsney, Shepherds Well, Snowdown, Aylesham. There is also a fast bus route No 12 Deal, Whitfield (south of A2, separated by A2 from Whitfield Urban Development), Canterbury. Enhancement of the network of walking and cycling routes promised in Chapter 3 will include installation of engineered, protected dutch style cycles paths, improvements of junctions in towns across the district especially near rail stations, and integration of cycle paths 1, 2, 15, 16 and 17 with all these 9 rail stations and 3 bus stations, and, trains and buses on these routes must carry (electric + cargo) bikes. Paragraphs 9.31 to 9.34 deal with the need to dual the A2 in order to provide additional highways capacity to and from the Port of Dover, while paragraph 9.34 deals with the High Speed rail line and the possibility of reducing travel times still further to London and, at the same time, improving rail capacity locally. These paragraphs introduce Strategic Policy 14 which is very specific in that it considers only the improvement of the A2. Strategic Policy 14 Highway Infrastructure. The Council’s ‘commitment to work with HE on long term improvements to A2’ must be more than pious lip-service reiterated to political colleagues in central government. It must result in the complete dualling of the A2 and Jubilee Way from Eastern Docks to Lydden Hill by December 2022, at the latest, the imposition of the Dover IBF makes this imperative. The separation of local traffic from through freight traffic by means of flyovers and underpasses at the Duke of York, and Whitfield roundabouts must take place by December 31 2022, 2 years after the Dover IBF was announced. SP14 would benefit from the addition of the following: “Proposals which assist in the provision of alternative transport modes across a dualled A2 will be encouraged. The Council will work with Highways England and Kent County Council to improve accessibility elsewhere in Kent between the two principal access routes to the Port of Dover, the M20 and the A2. The Council will work with partners to improve access to the local and High Speed rail network.“ DM Policy 29 The Highway Network and Highway Safety. The statement is welcome and it is to be hoped the DDC Cabinet uphold it in the future. It is proposed that the following wording replaces the final sentence in DM Policy 29, in order to clarify levels of significance or severity of increased traffic: “A Travel Plan or Transport Assessment will be required for all residential developments of more than 15 units, the requirements of which will be secured by planning conditions, Section 106 agreement or through the Community Infrastructure Levy as is appropriate.” Road improvements (especially on the A2, A20 and A256) to separate local traffic from through freight traffic must be done to save lives, road improvements that central govt must pay for this, especially as regards Strategic policies 4 Whitfield, 5+6 Aylesham and 7 Elvington and Eythorne. The separation needed must include flyovers and underpasses for local traffic. Improvements to the highway network must also include underpasses for (electric) bikes and real dutch-style, protected cycle-paths so that cycling commuters from Whitfield can get safely to Kearsney rail station and Martin Mill Stns. There should be a safe, engineered, dedicated cyclepath from Aylesham to Elvington, and another from Elvington to Shepherds Well. Safe kerbed pavements must be provided running from bus stops on A roads to any new development of 8 homes or more in rural village settlements to prevent old and young being trapped by car dependence up unsafe B-roads, which costs KCC money for taxis from schools, (see Kent active travel strategy ). Applicants must demonstrate that their plan includes the installation and cost of installation of the protected cycle-paths and kerbed pavements described above.

An additional sentence is needed : Enhance biodiversity in line with Kent Nature Partnership commitment to 20% enhancement to restore Kent’s depleted natural capital and mitigate 6th mass extinction. Retain all trees on the perimeter of large developments and pockets of existing trees within developments (see Chap 5). DM Policy 37 Quality of Residential accommodation: (See our recommendation on zero carbon homes above under Chapter 5 DM 1) Chapter 11 Natural Environment It is strange that this chapter is so removed from Climate Change chapter 5 with which it is so intrinsically linked, in planning as well as in real world terms. Climate change mitigation means protecting current natural carbon sequestration to the maximum and adding more natural carbon sequestration. The natural environment reaches far beyond the designated areas listed. The targets set to remedy our existential crises will not be met, by omitting huge swathes of Dover district that are key to reaching targets on commitments on the climate and ecological emergencies, viz 6th mass extinction event. We understand that evolving policy of KCC, is to measure and protect natural capital across Kent. This is also expected to feature in the soon-expected Environment Bill, promised in the Conservative party manifesto 2019. Natural capital is the world’s stocks of natural assets including soil, minerals, air, water and biodiversity. These assets provide a range of ‘ecosystem services’ that enable us all to survive and thrive. The most obvious services include the food we eat, the water we drink and timber we use for building and for fuel. Less visible ecosystem services include climate regulation, carbon sequestration, natural flood defence, water filtration, species habitat, and health and wellbeing. The Goodwin Sands nurture marine fauna and flora and provide a natural protection from coastal erosion. As such the Goodwin Sands should be considered part of the District’s natural capital, and be fully protected as such. Item 11.3 The Kent Nature Partnership commits to 20% biodiversity enhancement and so the 4th bullet point needs to add Enhance biodiversity in line with Kent Nature Partnership commitment to 20% enhancement to restore Kent’s depleted natural capital and mitigate 6th mass extinction. Strategic Policy 16 Protecting the district’s hierarchy of designated sites. We welcome this statement Strategic Policy 17 Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity: We recommend adding, Retain all trees on the perimeter of large developments and pockets of existing trees within developments (see Chap 5.) Work with Kent Nature Partnership to evaluate, and match protection of all natural capital.

DM Policy 39 Landscape Character. For many in Dover, especially those living in harsh economic circumstances, being able to look up to our green hills, brings peace and assuages grief in dark times. The same applies throughout the district. Protecting landscape character, for those on all incomes, for those of all ages, across the district, is intrinsically linked to mental and physical wellbeing. Landscape character both within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and in all other places, also underpins our green tourism economy. Losing landscape character to satisfy the demand for 30% profit margins of volume developers who have the ear of London ministers, would be shooting ourselves in the East Kent foot, and cost us dear. DM Policy 40 Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay SPA mitigation strategy. We commend. DM Policy 41 Air Quality Given the failure to get the Dover Inland Border Facility shifted from the location between a) the Dover Leisure Centre, where local sportspeople will suffer increased air pollution, and b) Christchurch Academy where students and staff will suffer increased air pollution and c) Dover Road, Guston where residents will suffer increased air pollution; given that the location of the IBF on a non-dualled A2, will lead to slower HGV and car journeys and longer periods of emissions from queuing vehicles, there is a need for an increase in Air Quality Monitoring Zones, in Guston, outside the Dover Leisure Centre, on the Duke of Yorks roundabout near DYRMS school, on the Whitfield roundabout and in Dover town, on the A256 Barton Road. (If the IBF and the jobs that go with it, had been relocated in autumn 2020 to a site further inland where the A2 is dualled, traffic flow would have been less impeded, and the Dept for Transport and DDC cabinet would have shown a greater respect for the KCC and Kent and Medway Energy and Low Emissions Strategies. ) DM Policy 42 Water Supply and Quality : There exists the danger that too much greenfield development / concrete will speed up runoff during wetter winters and lead to soil erosion. Conversely, to protect our production of food from suffering drought in more extreme summers, it is essential that rainwater and grey water harvesting be a prerequisite on new homes, and shade from existing retained trees be ensured. Moreover over-use of nitrates on farmland will reduce the supply of water that can be used by residents, and pollute streams, rivers, ponds and aquifers and endanger wildlife. DM Policy 43 The river Dour . We welcome all protections of this iconic stream / river. Chapter 12 Historic Environment This Chapter is generally very positive in terms of the draft policies for the protection and enhancement of the historic environment. There is, however, a requirement for a specific policy dealing with any developments within the Lydden Valley/former Wantsum Channel, the evolution of which may well be germane to our understanding of the creation of the English Channel (see below) as there is for Dover Western Heights. DM Policy 44 is welcome in that it refers not solely to the heritage asset but also to the setting of the asset. There is also a requirement for a Heritage Statement where a “heritage asset or its setting” are likely to be affected. The whole building approach to developments involving energy conservation improvements is to be welcomed. Where DM Policy 44 is weak is that it does not explicitly require conservation of an asset by recording. A suggested addendum to this policy would be at the end of the third paragraph: “… securing the optimum viable use of the heritage asset or ensuring its preservation through appropriate recording.” This would link DM Policy 44 more directly to DM Policy 46. DM Policy 45 Conservation Areas is generally welcome though the introductory sentence should be strengthened to read: “Applications for development or redevelopment in Conservation Areas will only be supported provided that such proposals preserve or enhance the special architectural or historic character and appearance of the Area and its setting.” Within this Policy, however, consideration should be given to reducing heat and energy loss and to sensitive solutions to providing energy efficient heating systems by adding a suitable further bullet point along the lines of: “Employ sustainable heating systems, such as ground source heating, and means of reducing energy and water consumption as are compatible with securing the sustainable future of the Area and its setting.” DM Policy 47 Dover Western Heights Fortifications Scheduled Ancient Monument and Conservation Area rightly emphasises the importance of the intervisibility of features both within the monument and with the wider landscape in order to fully understand the historic significance of the monument. The Lydden Valley/former Wantsum Channel is identified in Chapter 11 as forming a group of Landscape Character Types ((LCTs A, B and C) paragraph 11.42 and Table 11.1). Elsewhere in Chapter 11 (Fig. 11.1) the concentration of National Nature reserves, SSSIs and Special Protection Areas where the Wantsum meets the English Channel is demonstrated in map form. Historically, it is known that the Wantsum Channel provided a route for water borne traffic avoiding the more difficult waters around the North Foreland. Little is known of the evolution of this Channel and its silting up. As an area of more or less open water at different periods in the past various historic artefacts might be expected, such as fish traps, landing stages, salt working sites, temporary or permanent settlements taking advantage of the varied environments, and perhaps water craft. Ground disturbance along the line of the Wantsum Channel and its edges are likely to produce organic palaeo-environmental evidence which will add to the limited inorganic palaeo-environmental evidence from sites on chalk downland.This material could include timber structures and artefacts, vertebrate and invertebrate fauna, pollen, and aSedDNA. The Wantsum Channel is generally assumed to have been an open channel between the mainland of Kent and the Isle of Thanet, but how that channel arose in the first place is unknown. Given recent research into the creation of the English Channel, it may well be that the Wantsum Channel was created by the same tsunami, caused by the Storrega underwater rock slide, that obliterated Doggerland and carved out the present English Channel around 8,000 BC. The area potentially has immense national and international importance for understanding the late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods as well the development and use of the landscape in more recent periods. The inclusion of a specific statement and policy for the Lydden Valley/Wantsum Channel and its margins would appear appropriate, matching that for the Dover Western Heights and the Dover Town Centre SPD. It is suggested that the following statement is inserted after paragraph 12.29: “12.30 The Lydden Valley/Wantsum Channel provided a water route south of the Isle of Thanet avoiding the more difficult waters around the North Foreland at various times in the historic past. The origin of the Wantsum is unknown but may be linked to the formation, around 8,000 BC, of the English Channel as we know it today. Ground disturbance within the Wantsum and along its ancient shore line is likely to reveal evidence of the origin and development of this important landscape feature as well as evidence of its use from the Mesolithic through to the present day. DM Policy 48 The Lydden Valley/Wantsum Channel Proposals for development within the Lydden Valley/Wantsum Channel which make provision of appropriate archaeological and palaeo-environmental investigation prior to development will be supported. For the purposes of clarity the limits of the Lydden Valley/Wantsum Channel’s archaeological and palaeo-environmental area of interest will be co-terminous with the limits of the Environment Agency’s Flood Risk Map.” Paragraph 12.30 and Policy DM 48 Historic Parks and Gardens to be renumbered accordingly to take account of the proposal above.",
  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_green-party-campaigners-behind-launch-of-new-clean-water-campaign-group-sosdaw/content_30.html": "Around 150 local residents crowded into Walmer Parish Hall for the launch of Save Our Seas Deal and Walmer, SOSDAW, on Fri 3rd January, a new community campaign group open to all.\nTwo keen environmental campaigners, Jonathan and Emily Groves, and two volunteer organisers of the local Green Party, Christine Oliver and Sarah Waite-Gleave, worked hard over the festive period to get the new community campaign up and running by 3rd Jan. It has been supported since December by EKCA, East Kent Climate Action. Concerns over deteriorating seawater quality at Deal Beach surfaced as local front page news in July 2024. The rating by the Environment Agency (EA) was ‘excellent’ in 2019; reduced to ‘good’ in 2021; reduced to ‘sufficient’ in 2023. A context which meant that when in 23 August the Environment Agency recorded a ‘spike’ of e.coli and sewage, the downgrading went down to ‘poor’ from sufficient, and advice was published that it was not advisable to swim. This situation angered many in Deal and Walmer communities. It caused the cancellation of the Boxing Day dip.\nThe new community campaign group, SOSDAW, has its own email address sos deal and walmer @ gmail . com (remove spaces), a mailing list of nearly 200 since its launch and a petition http://www.change.org/p/clean-deal-walmer-coastal-waters with the aim of focussing the campaign and pushing those with responsibility for the issue (Southern Water, EA, DEFRA, DDC and KCC) to clean up and re-grade fast by December 2025, instead of waiting until Southern Water have to report to EA in Spring 2027. The petition gained 1000+ signatures in the 5 days after the launch.\nSOSDAW want actions in East Kent to include:\n- An immediate and long-lasting increase in the frequency of seawater testing by both Southern Water and the regulator EA, with an increase in the number of sites where testing is done between Sandown Castle, North Deal and Boundary Road, Walmer / Kingsdown.\n- Surveys of, and speedy upgrading of, infrastructure such as Southern Water assets (pipes, holding tanks, settlement tanks, etc); Infrastructure upgrades to put an end to storm overflow releases (given that there is a Kent-wide call to be more resilient in the face of more frequent extreme downpours and surface flooding) ; complete separation of foul sewage and surface water everywhere in CT14 postal area, including connections to Golf Road WPS.\n- Any sewage leakages originating at DDC owned properties including Deal Pier to be thoroughly repaired and pipes replaced at speed in 2025. The in-depth investigation by Southern Water which aims to report to EA by May 2027, to provide a public interim report by Dec 2025, given we have key coastal events due to happen in Walmer in summer 2026. EA to work on a ‘Step Change’ process speedily and work with the local community to identify problems, resolve them and enable an upgrade in seawater bathing quality in 2025.\n- Increased forward planning so that water companies become statutory consultees on all industrial, tourism, and housing developments and are required to provide Local Planning Authorities with reports on how developments will impact capacity and will connect to existing waste / foul water infrastructure before planning applications are approved; a speedy end to illegal / accidental misconnections of new bathrooms to the storm water drainage systems.\nThe petition contains a section on the background context relating to the water industry. The petition was informed by evidence given on 16 December 2024 to the DDC Overview and Scrutiny Cttee when 90 minutes were spent questioning Southern Water and Environment Agency representatives about pollution in coastal waters in the district.\nPrivate swimmers can decide for themselves whether to swim or not, whether to dismiss the EA rating, given our fast-flowing local currents. But organisers of seawater-based events (boxing day dip, rowing / sailing regattas) who need Public Liability Insurance are impacted when a reading of human faecal matter is recorded and local seabathing quality is down-graded. As has happened steadily since 2019.\nChair of the launch meeting, Green Party campaigner, Sarah Waite-Gleave said, “last night people were kind enough to thank us for getting organised fast. It was a lot of work over the Xmas weeks! Unfortunately the speakers we were expecting from Surfers against Sewage and Sewage Coalition (who did a parliamentary briefing on 9th Dec) couldn’t make it, so colleagues Emily Groves, Sam Brookfield and Mike Eddy had to step in at short notice, warm thanks go to them. The deputy leader of DDC, cllr Jamie Pout, cabinet member for environmental services and transport, turned up unexpectedly in the audience, and spoke during the Q&As which was very helpful from the point of view of public information. Those of us who are town councillors are also working with colleagues on Walmer and Deal Town Councils to get Southern Water to clean up our coastal waters.”\nThe public are asked to use the Environment Agency hotline to report any problems 0800 80 70 60 . To support the campaign, residents can sign the petition www.change.org/p/clean-deal-walmer-coastal-waters and join future demonstrations to demand a clean up and re-grading of our coastal waters fast. The launch was front page news in the Mercury on 8th January.

  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_ev-charging-points/content_111.html": "If you’ve been looking to get an EV (Electric Vehicle) and don’t have the ability to charge at home, you’ll be needing to charge away from home using destination charging.\nDestination charging is the process of topping up charge on an EV whilst you’re busy at a location such as shopping centres, leisure centres, hotels, restaurants, and more. Within Dover District there are chargers like this at Whitfield Lidl, Deal Aldi, and Dover Leisure Centre to name a few.\nBut, few is the operative word here. Look on any map of EV charging points, such as Zap Map, and you’ll see a distinct lack of chargers in the Dover District area, compared to elsewhere in the country.\nWith the recently announced ban on new sales of petrol and diesel cars in 2030, there will be increasing demand for charging capability within the area. This will be acutely more important for the many households in the district who don’t have off-street parking at home.\nGrants for Parish and Town Councils\nIn August of this year Kent County Council announced that further funding had been secured for new electric vehicle charging points across the county. Following a trial they were partnering with all interested Parish and Town Councils to install extra electric vehicle charge-points across Kent. The chargers would be located on land owned by the community such as village hall car parks, aiming to aid local residents and businesses that don’t have off-street parking.\nCllr John Lonsdale, Chair of Dover & District Green Party, has successfully applied to KCC on behalf of Walmer Parish Council for a charger installation at Deal and Betteshanger Rugby Club.\nThis will be providing a valuable service to almost 1,500 homes nearby with no off-street parking, as well as visitors to Walmer Strand and seafront just 5 minutes walk away.\nOur Green Party councillors on Deal Town Council, Dover Town Council and Ringwould with Kingstown Parish Council are also aiming to progress applications.\nWalmer Parish Council were successful using the Kent Parishes Grant Scheme, with £4k allowed per council to fund EV charging points at parish council owned land.\nThere are two other schemes in place at the moment:\n- Kent County Council is working with UK Power Networks to install EV charging in council car parks across the county.\n- The Office for Low Vehicle Emissions (OLEV) has also launched a fund to help Parish Councils install on-street EV charging points.\nThe Guardian (23 Nov 2020 edition) shared a national map which showed that Dover District was in the bottom 20% of the country for EV charging points (under 10 per 100,000 population). Maidstone Borough Council area was the only part of Kent that makes it to the average band (30-60 per 100,000).\nFree EV Charging Point Installation\nHowever, it is possible for a council to install chargers for FREE and make money from them! There are two major EV Charging providers who offer this service:\nAnother option for councils is to get retro-fitted chargers added to lamp posts, again producing revenue. One company doing this, EvStreetCharge, suggest that a charger like this can bring in an operating profit of £2.57 per charge for the owner, with an average monthly profit of £77.10 These are NOT free, but at this rate of revenue it would break even in 4 years\nAlternatively, Connected Kerb offer a couple of different innovative options that utilise recycled materials. The Gecko is designed to fit to existing street furniture, such as parking posts or bollards. It utilises renewable energy to provide charging, and also comes 5G enabled.\nYou can request implementation near you, and Connected Kerb will follow up with your local council to demonstrate that there is demand in their region: connectedkerb.com/request\nThe Armadillo is made from recycled vehicle tyres, ensuring minimal environmental impact and maximum durability. It is intended for a car park environment where cars will stay for a reasonable length of time. It offers 7kW charging, and is 5G enabled.\nStimulating Business\nHere at Dover District Green Party we encourage all local councils to take advantage of the grants and other options available to increase the presence of EV chargers within the region. As well as helping local residents take the step to EV ownership, reducing the impact of petrol and diesel cars on the local environment, it will help boost local business by encouraging visitors to the area.\nWith destination charging, cross-channel EV drivers will have the opportunity to charge locally before or after their ferry crossing. Considering they will likely be stopping for 30-60 minutes to charge, there is ample time to visit local shops, restaurants and attractions whilst charging.\nThe location of the old Townwall Street car park in Dover would make it a prime spot for visitors heading to the port to charge up and visit the St James Retail and Leisure Park whilst doing so. This is a project that either Instavolt or Osprey would relish, and an opportunity for Dover Town Council to add to their revenue stream.\nEV drivers are used to driving to charging locations away from main transport routes. This willingness to seek charging in different areas provides an opportunity to help stimulate business within Dover Town.\nWell-placed destination chargers could drive visitors who have 30+ minutes spare to visit shops, food outlets etc. Positioned in Pencester Road or Ladywell car park, they would encourage additional footfall to businesses in need.\nArticle by Nick Shread\nFind out more about EV ownership at his YouTube channel, Guy Goes Green\nImage by Nerijus jakimavičius from Pixabay",

Because nobody in East Kent should have their life or livelihood endangered with dodgy London decisions. KCC took over responsibility for the Dover IBF on 18 March 2021, so we need some guarantees from KCC. Hopefully, DfT / KCC have now woken up to, a) how very, very difficult it will be to have freight flowing into the IBF on roads that are closed in order for new dual carriageways to be built; b) how very difficult it will be to have new A2 dual carriageways + road-bridge built before the Dover IBF starts up, ‘in early 2022’. Road closures at the height of our staycation season? No thanks.\nSome verbal assurances are being offered to residents round the edges of the site, unwritten promises about reduced number of daily vehicles (500? 600?) and 140metre wide protection zone. But written guarantees are needed. Because nobody knows if the drop in exporting and importing because of new red tape is going to continue, or if freight flow through Dover will pick up again.\nOur local Green Party have campaigned since 29 Sept 2020, for East Kent local knowledge to be respected on the siting of the IBF. We’ve highlighted how senior Port of Dover people and Dover Society and parish councils including Deal and St Margarets, Langdon and Guston, have all spoken up about the dangers of the A2 bottleneck, the dangers on the Duke of Yorks roundabout. Relocating the site is / was the better option.\nResidents of Dover district and Guston must have guarantees from KCC; to protect students and staff in 2 schools from air pollution, to protect the peace and privacy of homes bordering IBF; to protect the lives of roadusers, to protect Kent County & Dover District public purse so that East Kent does not have to pick up the bill for foolish London mistakes.\nThe KCC decision (Environment and Transport Committee 18-3-2021) to ‘procure and manage the Inland Border Facility and Border Control Post work in Dover’ is strange,\n- given the enormous cuts that Central Govt have made to KCC funding in recent years;\n- given that with these 50% cuts to county council, Central govt has a record of turning a deaf ear to KCC requests for money for services it is forced to take on for the nation,\n- given that cuts gravely affect how KCC can cope with all the social services needs across the county,\n- given the impoverishment that families across Kent are suffering due to pandemic and lockdowns,\n- given our needs to put in place serious climate mitigation and adaptation steps to protect communities across Kent, and create GND jobs.\nWhy didn’t Conservative KCC candidates Nigel Collor and Trevor Bond, who were on the Environment and Transport KCC committee, March 2021, insist on guarantees for Dover?",

At long last Dover, the gateway to England, gets some of the 21st century infrastructure it needs. Dover & Deal Green Party have spent the last 3 years politely, persistently, pestering Dover District Council (DDC) on this issue.\nThey have now announced that DDC is to install 49 electric vehicle charging points at 18 locations in Dover, Deal and Sandwich, including both DDC-owned public car parks and on-street. They have stated that this is the biggest single investment in electric vehicle charging points in the district to date, which wasn’t hard to achieve.\nDDC received £224,270 from a funding bid to the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) to provide EV charging points, as part of their commitment to reducing carbon emissions.\nThe charging points are planned to be installed by March this year, but no information has yet been provided as to what type of chargers will be provided.

A water park and an hotel will use vast amounts of precious water from our taps, pump even more into the already strained sewage system, take business away from Deal and Dover, clog up our roads even more than they are already and destroy many acres of nationally important land for wildlife, particularly orchids.” Dover District Council has already approved the housing development at Sholden and Betteshanger Grove and they must now make amends and refuse this latest development”.\nThe evidence of the natural value has piled up. Joshua Styles, botanist made a strong case that the site meets selection criteria for SSSI – Site of Special Scientific Interest – protected by Natural England). Ecologists of Kent-wide & national reputation have objected on the DDC planning portal (22/01158 surf lagoon & 22/01152 5* hotel). Professor of Conservation Biology, Ian Swingland, has worked on the site, and he too objects strongly. Objections have also been made by local RSPB, Kent Wildlife Trust, Buglife, Plantlife, Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory and CPRE (Council for the Protection of Rural England) Kent after they did their own appraisals. The evidence is that the mosaic habitat is home to red listed endangered species including lizard orchids, poly grass and turtle doves as well as many other bats, birds, mammals (including beaver), reptiles (including rehomed common lizards), unusual insects, lichens, fungi and other flora and fauna.\nBackground information about the site and instructions on how to use the Dover district council planning portal to object, are both on the website of the community campaign group https://friendsofbetteshanger.co.uk/ . They are on facebook and tweet from Save Betteshanger Park . The good news is the campaign is now attracting real media attention including support from BBC Spring Watch presenters\nWe Greens emailed to hundreds of people in early Dec 2022 on how to object; we objected on the planning portal and we told DDC planning department and the Planning inspectorate that the Local Plan would be ‘unsound’ if Betteshanger Park were not protected as a Local Green Space & Biodiversity Opportunity Area. We included a call to defend Betteshanger in thousands of our locally delivered newsletters. We’ve also emailed our contacts at ITV Meridian and the Guardian suggesting they pick it up as national story.\nThere are over 800 local, non-party political campaigners working together to record the wildlife and protect this well-loved wildlife habitat. We urge those who value our endangered species to OBJECT on the DDC planning portal and to sign and share the petition. https://www.change.org/…/save-the-wildlife-at…",

They should not feel duty-bound to back the government because these plans are almost the direct opposite of manifesto promises and have never been put to the British people. We need all our local politicians, whichever party they come from, to stand up for nature, and to make plain that we can have robust local economies whilst also protecting natural habitatats and helping nature to recover. Local Tories have a special responsibility to say NO to their new leaders, on behalf of our community”.\nThe full letter reads:\nDear Dover district Conservative councillors,“This Government has today launched an attack on nature” ~ RSPB EnglandThere is widespread anger in response to government plans to remove fundamental legal protections for our environment. Opposition has come from many organisations ranging from the RSPB and National Trust through to the Wildlife Trusts and Friends of the Earth.\nAlongside the reckless approach to the nation’s finances, the government seems intent on tearing up protection for nature. In a three-pronged assault on nature Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng plan to;\nScrap planning rules that protect nature in new ‘investment zones’ covering huge areas of the country.[1] [2] Rip up environmental protections introduced by the EU, without plans for replacement.[3]\nWithdraw plans to help farmers to protect nature [4], with reports suggesting the ‘Environmental Land Management Scheme’ (ELMS) has been ‘put on hold’ whilst a return to a Common Agricultural Policy type per acre payment is expected, which will break a specific manifesto pledge [5].Of course just before these announcements we also saw Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg open the door to environmentally damaging fracking, a policy that is widely opposed, will do nothing to reduce energy bills and which the founder of Cuadrilla himself says is unviable [6].The responses from those who care for nature have been overwhelming. Joan Edwards, director of policy for The Wildlife Trusts, says these policies will mean “polluters can get away with poisoning our rivers and countryside – even more than they are doing already.” [7] Hilary McGrady of the National Trust says, “environmental protections are dismissed as ‘burdens’, while investment and growth are pitted against nature and climate action.”\nThese proposals come as part of a ‘dash for growth’ package which is also spooking markets and ruining government finances. There is no mandate for these measures: they actually reverse the direction of travel on the environment in your 2019 manifesto and have never been put to the British people.Yet we know people’s livelihoods and local economies can be put on a sound footing with a three pronged approach to investment: in nature recovery, in renewable energy and in home insulation to reduce energy bills. Research has shown that “Protection and use of environmental assets is key to evening out economic imbalances between metropolitan and rural areas”[8]. In other words, the recovery of nature and the revival of local living standards should and can go hand-in hand.\nWe call on you to make plain to your party leaders that these policies must be reversed. We ask for a public statement from your group leader on your group’s views about these policies.\nThere is no case for staying silent, and every reason to stand up for your communities and for your local environment by making it plain that you will not support the tearing up of environmental protection and the reversal of attempts to help nature thrive.\nResources:[1] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-growth-plan-2022-factsheet-on-investment-zones/the-growth-plan-2022-investment-zones-factsheet\n[2] Map of investment zones: https://twitter.com/RSPBEngland/status/1573366828222808064\n[3] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-environment-laws-under-threat-in-deregulatory-free-for-all\n[4] https://www.edie.net/reports-defra-set-to-scrap-plans-to-pay-farmers-for-nature-restoration-and-creation/\n[5] “”in return for funding, [farmers] must farm in a way that protects and enhances our natural environment” https://www.conservatives.com/our-plan/conservative-party-manifesto-2019\n[6] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/21/fracking-wont-work-uk-founder-chris-cornelius-cuadrilla\n[7] https://www.birdguides.com/news/uk-government-launches-all-out-assault-on-environment/\n[8] https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_918714_en.htm",

CAMBYs are people who Care About My Back Yard, who do not deserve to be scapegoated, as nimbys, by ministers of older, lobby-laden governments seeking to please the property development lobby.\nWe need the right sort of housing and planning policies to resolve the housing crisis that blights the lives of many under 40s. We need new, genuinely-affordable homes for first time buyers and also social housing at fixed affordable rents on longterm tenancy agreements. But so many new developments within 2 miles of Deal, and in Dover district generally, do not offer this sort of housing, although we welcome the council housing that DDC has been able to roll out, for example 48 homes in Wingfield Place, Deal.\nDevelopments on what was ‘best and most versatile’ arable land (which may have been conveniently down-graded) got into the Local Plan, despite words in the National Planning Policy Framework NPPF urging their protection. But the climate emergency worldwide means that yields of staple crops that our UK could until now expect to import, will be in shorter supply. So it is essential that UK retains and improves its national food security, that it retains its food-growing fields and orchards, and protects the quality of soils and the productivity of the fields.\nRight Homes, right place, right price charter is the Green Party policy that balances out competing demands for land.\nThese policies to push the influential house building lobby (who like a return on investment of 20-30% in Kent) to build the right homes (meaning energy-saving, solar-roofed homes), in the right place (within close distance of services, work and schools so likely to be within settlements, and less likely to be greenfield), available at the right price (genuinely affordable for those suffering with our housing crisis).\nOn greenfield sites just outside the Deal/ Walmer parish boundaries, many new developments are springing up.\nWe need walk-able neighbourhoods with low-rise blocks of flats, and new low-carbon terraced houses so that we use land more effectively, for the benefit of people and planet.\nTwo new sites in Sholden, in Mongeham, two sites either side of Cross Road, Mill Hill, in Ringwould & Kingsdown on the A258, on the southern edge of Walmer too.\nAnd objections (including ours) are pouring in on DDC planning portal about application number 25/00112 : 70 dwellings land NW of Kingsdown Rec ground on the edge of Kent Downs AONB.\nThe public protested against 50 houses when the draft Local Plan was consulted on. It is a development that will reduce wildlife on the edge of a popular but congested rural village with no pavements, on one of the few possible diversion routes used by emergency services when our A258 carrying traffic from Deal / Walmer to Dover /Whitfield is closed.\nAND just 1 mile north of the Kingsdown development, along the Glen Rd / Liverpool Rd route (single lane with passing places), much used on the school run to primary school, the site of Ray’s Bottom (SAP 15 in Local Plan) was the subject of a presentation by developer GSE prior to seeking outline permission for another 75 dwelling development, on 25 February at Walmer Parish Hall. This is a site on a steep, food-growing field, adjacent to wildlife rich, chalk downland, Hawkshill Freedown.\nWhat other problems crop up when developers go for greenfield first? ‘Natural solutions to climate change in Kent’ a report adopted March 2021 by KCC, says we need to retain grassland, farmland, wetlands and woodlands because they capture carbon. Sacrificing natural carbon sequestration capacity without making sure the homes are built to zero carbon standards (with solar roofs, orientated to maximise natural heating, cooling and lighting, rainwater harvesting, high-spec insulation / double glazing, etc) exacerbates the climate crisis. It is thus contradictory to the advice of the national Climate Change committee and is not environmentally sustainable.\nAnd of course we know we need to restore nature from its terribly nature-depleted state, so that nature can restore us. Only with the maximum retention of surrounding trees, inclusion of bird boxes, swift bricks, bat bricks, the planting (and maintaining for 3 year thereafter) of two native trees per dwelling, will the biodiversity net loss incurred by the sacrifice of a greenfield site be mitigated (whatever is said by rough and ready desktop calculations claiming BNG, biodiversity net gain).\nWe need water companies to be statutory consultees, on the capacity of the sewer and freshwater pipes to cope with extra pressures as part of all applications for planning permission. Similarly, Kent Resilience Forum has contacted all parish councils to urge action, to protect Kent from extreme weather conditions we’ve started to experience, to reduce flood risks, by making hard surfaces permeable, to put in fire breaks between residential sites and farmland. But our DDC planning department and planning committee have not seemed too keen to stand up to developers on such issues. Alas!",

(Picture shows cllr Beccy Sawbridge & Sarah Gleave and other Greens). National evidence shows that teachers, nurses, railway workers, front line PCS and other key workers are labouring in severely understaffed circumstances. Consequently these key workers find the cost of living crisis is pushing them to foodbanks and they see the services they provide becoming worse and worse. At the Green Party conference of Autumn 2022, we Greens decided overwhelmingly to support the Enough is Enough campaign.\nAt DDC full council meeting on 25th January 2023, our Green campaigner Sarah pushed to Conservative cabinet to do more on these issues, with a question as a member of the public. (youtube link here https://youtu.be/LBWRIq5hyOM)\nBelow we provide the full text of a letter from Cllr Christine Oliver & campaigner Sarah, published in the Dover/ East Kent Mercury on 1st Feb 2023.\n“Are people stuck at home with illness getting the care they need to wash, dress and feed themselves? Adult social care services are very understaffed, and with a question put to Dover district council at their full meeting on 25th Jan, we, Greens, are trying to find out if the situation in our Dover district is better or worse that the national average of 10% of posts vacant, and 165,000 unfilled social care posts in England. Both the ill and those who care for them at home, will be affected if the KCC cuts to community services, for example cuts to services for adults with learning disabilities, and cuts to services for young families, go through. Families in Walmer, Elvington, Dover, St Radigunds, Deal, and services at Blossoms, Sunlight, and Meadowbank seem to be affected. There is currently a KCC consultation running until March 26th, and we urge many people to respond to it. We also suggest people support the on-line petition https://www.change.org/p/save-blossoms-children-s-centre-and-the-sunflower-centre/\nThe understaffing (because of low pay and ever-worsening conditions) in social care, is part of the larger picture of hardship among our key life-giving workers in the public sector. Evidence from the Financial Times, and the Office of National Statistics proves how public sector pay has fallen well behind private sector pay, and is nowhere near keeping up with inflation. How daft it is in a time of recruitment crisis among our key workers, for spoilt, dictatorial ministers to threaten the key workers who are hanging on with a deterioration in their conditions of employment, a reduction in their negotiating rights as members of a trade union. Most people would understand threats and deteriorating work conditions are more likely to speed up than slow down a recruitment and retention crisis, we suggest. Enough is enough. It is also worth pointing out that with almost two-thirds of new wealth amassed since the start of the pandemic having gone to the richest 1%, there is an obvious means of lifting key workers out of the cost-of-living crisis and motivating staff to stay, in social care, health care, ambulance service, teaching and other public services we all need. We need a wealth tax. “\nSarah Gleave, Cllr Christine Oliver : Dover and Deal Green Party",

Together we Dovorians need to demand answers to many questions. ”\n- How much delay due to lorry chaos will ambulances from Deal + Dover experience getting to WHarvey Hospital, next door to one of 4 proposed lorry parks?\n- What arrangements have been made for honest, thorough assessments of the Whitfield 1200 lorry site in terms of local traffic / environmental impact / air pollution ?\n- DDC plans for a rapid transit bus from Whitfield – over a new flyover by Archers Roundabout + new link road from B+Q roundabout to Guston, Dover Road, then down to town and Dover Priory station(consultation ends this week): Was this planned because DDC knew the Whitfield lorry park was coming ?\n- How long have Dover’s 19 Conservative DDC cllrs (5 of whom are also KCC councillors) known about the plans for Whitecliffs Business Park to be the site for a 1200 lorry park?\n- What steps have they taken to force central govt to try harder to get us the UK /EU27 trade deal and ‘frictionless’ border they’ve been promising? What steps has Dover’s MP taken to push Johnson to go for the frictionless border her husband promised?\n- The Department of Transport has approved a Development Consent Order (DCO) for a new cargo airport at Manston last month. Will the same site also fit 5800 HGV trucks ? Is this another govt mess? Are Manston’s new American owners, RSP, lined up for an expensive buy-out with public money?\n- How will Dover’s 70% rural economy be affected ? Will light industry recently set up here, move elsewhere?\n- How will residents of Dover town feel with queues of lorries all around them, on A20 + A2 + A256 ?\n- What will be the effects on the carbon footprint and pollution generally, if HGVs are spending 3 or 4 times as long crawling around East Kent ? The impacts of climate change are the greatest threat to this generation.\nHow will the lorry parks and problems affect food production, distribution and food prices in East Kent ?\nFurther Reading:\n- https://www.msn.com/en-us/finance/other/uk-plans-truck-stop-by-white-cliffs-of-dover-after-brexit/ar-BB178Lw4\n- https://theisleofthanetnews.com/2019/01/23/post-brexit-plan-for-a256-traffic-restriction-scheme-and-4-9million-spend-on-manston-lorry-park/\n- https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/cost-farcical-pre-brexit-lorry-2403273\n- https://www.kentonline.co.uk/dover/news/perfect-car-crash-warning-183163/\n- https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/projects/south-east/manston-airport/",

The vacancies were caused because principled councillors felt obliged to resign when the Conservative leaders of Sandwich Town Council acted autocratically instead of listening to all elected representatives.\nSadly Kent sees, far too often, the leaders of such majority groups (often elected by just 15% of those registered to vote) acting as if they have a right to do anything they please, acting as if no-one has the right to question their actions.\nYour local Green Party in Dover district hopes lots of Sandwich people will vote on 10 February. We believe Britain needs more local, democratic accountability, not less! We applaud the position of Sandwich Matters Independent group who have pushed for public accountability since the STC resignations.\nWe, of Dover and Deal Green Party, are delighted that Rob Edwards is standing in Sandwich North. He is a hard-working local Sandwich resident who cares deeply about environmental, social and climate justice. He would bring a fresh Green voice to STC.\n“I’d speak up for the protection of green spaces in Sandwich, for the enhancement of cycle lanes and bus services to local villages. We need housing projects that are cheap-to-rent, and cheap-to-heat on brownfield sites instead of greenfield ones and an even break for small local businesses competing with chain stores.”\nAcross England and Wales, there are over 475 Green Party Councillors at District or County level. And many more on town and parish councils, all focussed on Local accountability.\nOur councillers work within the Independent Local Government Association and challenge the old, tired and unaccountable two-party system. With 5 by-election WINS in Kent in autumn 2021, district / borough council level, there are now 21 Green Party Councillors on Kent’s local planning authorities (4 on ThanetDC) AND 4 Green KCC councillors.\nIn Dover district since 2019, Greens have 10 town / parish council seats (Deal, Walmer, Dover and Ringwould w/ Kingsdown). We’ve been work hard and constructively with councillors of other parties to make practical local improvements and to speak up for voters.\nWe think it would help all in Sandwich if hard-working Rob Edwards is elected as a new Green voice on Sandwich Town Council.",

Some of the Conservative Cabinet changes seem to downplay the work to adapt to, and mitigate, the fast-approaching Climate Crisis. The cross party DDC Climate Change Working Group was ended 2 June 2021 after 18 months of existence, 4 weeks after the KCC elections.\nThe DDC Conservative Cabinet meets 10 -11 times a year and has a monopoly of policy decisions, which many observers see as less than a democratic system. The reshuffle appears to signal that DDC Conservative Cabinet is disinclined to implement the KCC report ‘Natural Solutions to Climate Change in Kent’ commissioned from Buro Happold, accepted by KCC committee meeting 18th March 2021, and paid for by Kent taxpayers.\nThis is a summary of the DDC re-shuffle.\n- Leader of the Council:\nCllr T J Bartlett - Deputy Leader:\nCllr O C de R Richardson\n(New Deputy Leader) - Portfolio Holder for Community and Corporate Property:\nCllr O C de R Richardson\nNew.

A strange choice.\nRwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and one of the smallest. At 242,749 km2, the UK is 9 times bigger than Rwanda (a mere 26,338 km2).\nDepending on which census and population estimates you take, Rwanda’s population density comes out at between 470 people per km2 and 513 people per km2. The UK as a whole has a population density of some 270 to 280 people per km2. The figures for England (around 426 per km2) are closer to the lower end of Rwanda’s population density, though they are still below it.\nThe UK’s population growth rate is around 0.7%, whereas Rwanda’s is about 2.5%. So Rwanda is filling up with inhabitants quicker than the UK without the need for “importing” asylum seekers. This is despite the fact that Rwanda’s life expectancy is the 26th lowest (out of 224 countries and territories) while the UK enjoys the 35th best life expectancy rate.\nAs I say, a strange choice, made even stranger by the fact that Israel tried a similar deal with Rwanda a few years back. It failed badly.",

There are dozens of Green candidates standing in all the districts of Kent. This county level council is responsible for:\n- Kent highways (streets, roads and footpaths)\n- Educational services (the ones not yet privatised to academies)\n- Public safety and public health\n- Libraries\n- Trading standards\n- Social services\n- Transport\n- Waste management (recycling centres, tips)\n- And in 2025, KCC will have some voice in local government reorganisation too.\nIn Dover District\nDeal and Walmer\nChristine Oliver\nI’m proud to be standing for election to represent Deal and Walmer at Kent County Council. I have lived and worked in Deal all my adult life and I am raising my family here.\nI love this corner of Kent and I’m dedicated to making it the best it can be. I know the area and the challenges local people face very well.\nMy background is in law and I work now in charity management. I have volunteered for Citizen’s Advice, served as a trustee for local charities, as a school governor for Sholden Primary School and as a Councillor on Deal Town Council for four years.\nMy priorities are to:\n- Promote active travel and improve our public transport\n- Reduce pollution in our rivers and seas.\nPlease vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in all wards of Deal, Walmer and Sholden will see Christine’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nDover Town\nLiz Hayes\nI’m proud to announce that I will be the Green Party’s candidate in my home town, Dover, for the KCC elections on Thursday May 1st. I’m happy to live, work and bring up my family in Dover, which has so much to offer in terms of its history, beautiful natural environment and vibrant community spirit.\nHaving moved to Dover 20 years ago, I have developed a deep fondness for the town and have worked hard to contribute to our community. In 2015 I worked with a team of committed volunteers to set up the group ‘Transition Dover’, part of the Transition Town network. We bring people together on grassroots projects including creating more green spaces for wildlife and running Dover Repair Café for 6 years now.\nSo many people are struggling and it isn’t right. Green councillors are pushing hard for a fairer Kent. As a parent and an experienced teacher, I want to ensure our children can grow up in an environment that is safe and healthy. A town that offers them opportunities for secure housing and employment. They deserve education that prepares them for a changing future and our schools require adequate funding and support to make this happen.\nWe need clean, cheap public transport, well-maintained roads and safe cycle-paths and pavements for pushchairs, people and walking frames. We need clean, green energy that cuts energy bills and gives our country energy security.\nKent is crying out for real change, for kindness, for investment in jobs in a well-being economy. I would speak up for Dover and make sure our corner of Kent cannot be ignored. Please vote Green in 2025.”\nVoters in all wards of Dover, including Melbourne Ave, Aycliffe and River will see Liz’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nSandwich and villageS\nPeteR Findley\nI am proud to be a candidate in Sandwich and villages. I’m known across East Kent as a wildlife and countryside campaigner and it takes up a lot of my time since I retired from the Kent Specialist Teaching Service.\nI’m one of the many who volunteer in the community, where I’ve served as a school governor, and more recently as a trustee of Gazen Salts Nature Reserve and of Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory. Since 2023 I have also been a councillor on both Walmer and Deal Town Councils.\nMy interests include surveying wildlife on a Nature Friendly Farming Network farm on the Ash Levels. I love this corner of Kent where I’ve lived, worked and raised my family.\nI’m dedicated to making it the best it can be for local people now and in the future. I am known locally for speaking up and writing against environmental and social injustices. We must get enough funding for KCC child and adult social services, move the Making Space for Nature project forward and improve rural bus services. All of us will benefit from a fairer and more resilient Kent. Please vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in Eastry, Ash, Goodnestone, Preston, Sandwich, Staple, East Stourmouth, Wingham, Woodnesborough and Worth will see Peter’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nDover North VILLAGES\nSarah Waite Gleave\nThe new KCC council of 2025 will have a voice in shaping sweeping local government changes. Ministers in London want planning to be centralised in Maidstone under a new Kent mayoral authority.\nIn the villages of Dover North we need to protect our food-growing fields, our wildlife habitats. The district needs to build the cheap-to-heat, low energy homes, in the right places close to services, to be sold or rented at genuinely affordable prices to solve the housing crisis.\nAs a planning spokesperson for our local party, I worked on our 25 page submission on the DDC Local Plan. I met many parish level campaigners at the hearings in November 2023. Planning decisions must be made close to the communities who have local knowledge of traffic and land use. And be subject to scrutiny. If elected I will stand up for this principle on all occasions.\nI’ve campaigned here since 2009, and have served as a parish councillor twice since 2017. I have often spoken up on highways, safe pavements, protection of woodland and green spaces.\nI am very concerned by central government plans to make 5 East Kent councils into one, in the half of Kent with highest need, and lowest tax raising capacity. I was at protests in Maidstone and the House of Lords to ask for better in January 2025.\nEast Kent deserves more from KCC than 15 years of Conservative cuts to services, sadly cuts to councils continue under Labour. I would work for a fairer, more resilient Kent so we can help end the cost of living crisis. Please vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in Aylesham, Great Mongeham, Guston, East Langdon, Nonington, Northbourne, Ringwould, Kingsdown, Ripple, St Margaret’s, Sutton and Tilmanstone will see Sarah’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.\nDover West Villages\nNick Shread\nI’m delighted to announce that I will be the Green Party’s candidate in my home town for the KCC elections on Thursday May 1st.\nI live in a village in the Dover West KCC division and know well the concerns of our communities.\nI’ve been a hard-working Town Councillor in Dover since 2023, and this year I was extremely pleased to bring my Motion for the Ocean before the council. Aiming to ensure closer community links with the sea, the motion looks to support initiatives which embrace our unique location.\nI would be delighted to have the opportunity to support the local community more, with the additional resources and influence afforded to County Councillors. Please vote Green in 2025.\nVoters in Alkham, Capel-le-ferne, Denton, Wootton, Eythorne, Elvington, West Hougham, Lydden, Shepherdswell, Temple Ewell and Whitfield will see Nick’s name on their postal vote or ballot paper.",

It is similar for older patients.\nIt is ridiculous to blame the professionals of the NHS which has been fragmented and run-down by Conservative politicians since they passed the Health and Social Care Act in 2012, and paved the way to privatising health services.\nIn my case work as a councillor, it is apparent that the ever-widening inequalities in our society contribute to mental health problems and impede recovery. Evidence from the House of Commons library shows, “Poorer people were less likely to recover as a result of treatment under the IAPT programme than the better-off”, and the disabled and minorities also have lower levels of recovery.\nWhat can be done?\n- The NHS needs to be taken back into public ownership so that profiteering corporates with friends in government stop taking their cut from funding.\n- We need serious long-term investment in the mental health services of the NHS so that we turn round the problem of understaffing (nurses and doctors). This would also free up our police who are called in time and again across Kent to help ill people who become a danger to themselves or others.\n- We need some joined-up thinking between the Dept of Work and Pensions, answerable for Universal Credit and the Dept for Health and Social Care because we see increases in referrals for mental health services following the introduction of Universal Credit.",

Seeing this visually helps to identify areas that need attention either by adding insulation, draft-proof strips, replacement of failed double glazing units, adding secondary glazing or repairs to masonry work or even simple low cost solutions such as installing thermal blinds and curtains or draft proof strips around doors, windows, and letter boxes.\nThe best time for taking thermal images is on a cold, dry and dull day when the heating has been on for a few hours – so typically between November and April each year. The greater the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the house the better the images. Rain and sun can give distorted readings so ideally on or at the end of a cold cloudy day is ideal.\nHow to get an image survey:\nInterested households should register their interest at deputyclerk@walmercouncil.co.uk or by calling the Walmer Town Council office on 01304 362363. Photos are available to keep if requested, and will be sent by email.\nCommunity volunteers provide this service for free. The volunteers are given basic training to use the camera and will bring the camera to your home to use on the outside. They will show you the thermal images as you go around the house, discussing any areas where heat appears to be escaping or insulation may be inadequate. Photos are also available to keep if requested, and will be sent by email. The service is available to Walmer residents only. There’s no cost.\nAdvice\nOnce hot spots and areas leaking heat have been identified, speak to a qualified heating and insulation specialist about suitable solutions. You can also head to the Centre for Sustainable Energy website or call 0800 082 2234 for some tips, solutions, ideas and links to further support and possible funding. Reducing heat loss from your home will save you money on your heating bills, keep you warmer, reduce pollution and lower your carbon footprint.",

London Conservative Government cares so little for Dover District that it won’t tell District / County Conservative councillors about the land it plans to commandeer for a border post and lorry park for 1200 HGVs near Whitfield, and a junior minister can only spare 30 mins to stonewall and evade talking about the impact on Whitfield, Guston, Dover, Deal and all our local East Kent roads and way of life.\nConservative councillors are powerless in the face of a Conservative government in London that doesn’t give even half a hoot for East Kent. At the Dover District Council meeting 21st Oct, the Labour motion demanding disclosure and consultation from central Govt regarding Dover border control centre and lorry park stimulated heart-felt expressions of deep concern from both sides of Council Chamber, about the big changes that will be imposed between now and 1st July. The amended motion passed unanimously. Hats off to Kevin Mills’ Labour team for well-informed research and determined defense of East Kent needs. But deep concern doesn’t butter any parsnips. Probably the only thing that might cause the needs of Dover to be respected by Johnson, the greedy Conservative autocrat in Downing Street, is if the 19 Conservative cllrs on Dover District Council and 7 county cllrs resigned from the Conservative Party en-bloc to become an independent majority who put the urgent needs of our Dover district before Party ambition.\nLast year the Local Govt Information Unit said Kent is one of 10 English counties with between 16% and 13.9% of their GDP at risk in a no-deal exit. The pandemic means that the livelihoods of Kent people are much more vulnerable now. Kent NFU is deeply worried about Downing street’s failure to listen to their campaign to Save British Food and Farming from No-Deal and a possible US trade deal. Dover district needs cllrs at Whitfield and Maidstone who will show backbone and stand up to Downing street, and we need it now.\nLetter from Sarah Gleave and Mike Eddy,\nDover and Deal Green Party",

The Bill was presented in Parliament, first by Caroline Lucas MP (Grn) then by Olivia Blake MP (Lab).\nOur local Green parliamentary spokesperson Christine Oliver, pointed out in July, “There is a gap between what is currently being delivered-and what the Government needs to do to act in line with the latest science.\nThe Climate and Ecology Bill, or CE Bill, would:\n- Provide a clear, joined-up plan-the crises in climate and nature are deeply intertwined, requiring a plan that considers both together.

  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_why-are-greens-standing-in-the-general-election-in-dover-and-deal/content_84.html": "We believe that this Tory government is disastrous for people and planet and needs to be removed. Sadly, the Labour Party seem more interested in preventing Greens growing stronger than in getting rid of the Tories.\nNationally, Labour have not been prepared to make any agreements with the Green Party on standing aside or not campaigning in particular seats, despite being asked. Locally, Labour in Dover and Deal have consistently refused to make agreements that would benefit them in exchange for an agreement in areas where Greens are the strongest placed party to defeat the Tories. This was the case in 2017 [1], 2019 [2] and more recently in the 2023 [3] local elections where they stood two candidates in Eastry Rural.\nGreens are a political party – standing in elections is what we do.\nThe Green Party are a distinct political party with clear and progressive policies. We exist to get the change we so desperately need through the political process by getting fresh people elected to all levels of government. Greens believe it is important to work through both the electoral system and campaigning organisations like Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and Amnesty International, as well as grassroots groups working locally.\nWe see the difference it makes in political decision making to have a few elected Greens in the room. For example Caroline Lucas has had an outsize influence on UK politics far beyond her sole Green MP status.\nIn Dover and Deal due to hard work over many years, Greens are now the third party in the district. We hold power to account, whether that power is wielded by Labour or by the Tories. But we also work collaboratively with those who want to get things done to improve the lives of local people, whatever their political affiliation.\nWe give voters the opportunity to vote Green or to choose to vote tactically.\nWe believe that everyone should have the right to vote Green (or for any other legal party). If they choose to vote tactically (for example, to prevent a party they dislike from winning) that is their choice. To force them to vote tactically by deliberately not standing and removing their right to vote for their preferred candidate would be wrong.\nFor another party to tell the Greens not to stand (for example, to get the Tories out) is also wrong and smacks of authoritarian states in which only some parties are allowed to stand.\nWe argue that there is an exception when the Green Party enters into a reciprocal agreement with another progressive party to support a shared aim, like preventing a disastrous Tory government getting re-elected. In this case, although the Greens would not stand in one area, it would only be in exchange for another party not standing in another area where Greens have the best chance of winning. That way each party and their supporters get a benefit from the arrangement.\nThe ‘splitting the vote’ narrative is simplistic and inaccurate.\nWe should never take anyone’s vote, or their reasons for choosing a particular party, for granted. It is often claimed that if Greens were not standing, ‘their votes’ would automatically go to Labour. This is patronising to voters and not true.\nFor instance, in 2019, in an election dominated by Brexit:\n- Some traditional Labour voters voted Tory because they supported Brexit and weren’t convinced by Corbyn – Labour lost these votes to the Tories; Greens did not steal them.\n- Some ‘Remain’ supporting traditional Tory voters voted for the Green candidate Beccy Sawbridge as the Remain candidate, but would not vote for Labour – so Beccy reduced the Tory vote.\n- Some were torn between Green in principle and tactically with Labour – they made their own minds up, because by standing, Greens gave them the choice. Some voted Labour, some Green.\n- Some Green voters have told us that they would either not vote or would spoil their ballot if there was no Green candidate to vote for.\nSo it is not as simple as ‘splitting the vote’. In 2019 Natalie Elphicke won because more people voted for her than for Charlotte Cornell. Labour failed to persuade enough people to vote for them. That’s how the First Past The Post (FPTP) system, supported by the two big parties, works.\nGreens support proportional representation (PR).\nMany of these tensions between progressive parties would be minimised by PR. What’s more, our current Government disaster has been accentuated by an electoral system in which a party that received support from just 43.6% of voters could command a massive parliamentary majority, able to force through a hard Brexit, a succession of unelected Prime Ministers and austerity against the wishes of the majority.\nGreens have always supported Proportional Representation and already use it for all our internal elections. The Lib Dems also support PR. PR was in Labour’s 1997 manifesto, but was never implemented. Despite the majority of Labour members supporting PR, it seems that Keir Starmer is not – and will not be – a supporter, especially if he gets a large majority at the next election. Greens do not believe this is how democracy should work.\nNot standing in an election costs the Green Party money.\nUnder the current rules, opposition parties receive funding from the taxpayer, under a scheme called ‘Short Money‘. The amount payable is £19,400 for every seat won at the General Election plus £38.75 for every 200 votes gained by the party. By not standing, the Green Party reduces the amount of money that its elected MPs receive to run our back office operations. With no wealthy donors, or trade unions to fund it, the Green Party relies on this form of funding to run its Westminster offices.\nSome questions and answers about our decision to stand\nWhy are you standing a candidate?\nWe have an excellent parliamentary candidate in Christine Oliver, who lives locally, understands the particular context of Dover and Deal and who we believe will do a better job for the people of Dover and Deal than either Natalie Elphicke or Labour’s candidate, Mike Tapp. Given how similar the policies of Tories and Labour are, it is crucial that the assumptions underlying them are held up and shown to be found wanting. Christine will do this.\nDo you think local Labour supporters are aware that you offered an agreement and that Labour refused?\nNo, we don’t think they are aware that we offered an agreement in previous elections and again this year. Labour Party members often come to the Green Party, asking us not to stand, and are genuinely very surprised when we tell them the history of offers we have made to Labour.\nIf Labour changed their minds, and offered to do a reciprocal deal, favouring Labour in Dover and Deal and favouring the Greens in a constituency where Greens have the best chance of ousting a Conservative MP, would you accept?\nYes, if it was genuinely reciprocal.\nIf the Greens didn’t stand, where do you believe the Green votes would go?\n‘Green votes’ sounds like we own them. We don’t; they belong to the individuals concerned. We believe we have to win votes at each election by having better policies, harder working and more honest and committed politicians.\nIf there was not a Green candidate, many who previously voted Green would probably vote Labour. Others might vote Lib Dem because they support PR. Others would not vote.\nWe are also aware that many previous Conservative voters are considering voting Green because they are horrified by the Government’s record on Brexit, Partygate, PPE scandals and lack of action on the nature and climate emergencies. These ex-Tory voters may not, however, be prepared to vote for Labour. So overall the picture is complicated.\nDuring your general election campaign, will you be actively targeting Labour supporters?\nWe will inform everyone about Green policies and let them make their own minds up who to vote for. However, after 12+ years of the most disastrous series of Conservative Governments, we believe that ex-Conservative voters will be desperate for a change (as is the rest of the country).\n[1] 2017 snap General Election. We offered local Labour’s then election agent, Simon Bannister, a written agreement to stand down in return for a written public commitment to fair proportional voting and an agreement by Labour to stand down in one 2019 DDC rural ward.\n[2]2019 snap General Election. Labour’s parliamentary candidate, Charlotte Cornell, was a principled local activist who played a full role within Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform. Our local Green Party membership agreed to suppress our own vote by messaging that we stood a candidate because voters deserved choices, that choices would be easier if we had PR, that we understood if voters chose to vote with their hearts in local elections even if they voted for a bigger party in general elections. We could have doubled or tripled our vote if we’d messaged differently.\n[3] 2022 / 2023 Local Elections. In July 2022 our election agent offered that we would not field candidates in the 11 DDC seats held by Labour, to end Tory rule at DDC with a rainbow coalition. In return we asked Labour not to stand candidates in Eastry Rural ward. In early Feb 2023 this was discussed with the leader of Labour DDC group. An email was sent to new election agent G Cowan in March 2023. We kept to our word. If Labour respected it, the Tory group at DDC might now be down to 12 with a greater margin of safety for the Labour majority group. By making Tories fight hard to keep Eastry Rural and other DDC Tory wards, we reduced their campaigning capacity in the 17 seats (6 gains) Labour fought to take.",

Half the edition is devoted to the impacts of coastal erosion and the destruction of bogs and wetlands in the build-up to November’s Cop26 confernence in Glasgow.\nOf special interest to those of us in East Kent is report of CITiZAN (the Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network) which carried out work in Sandwich Bay where wooden fish traps have been recorded, the positions of which can shed light on coastal and tidal changes.\nBut one of the most worrying discoveries of the CITiZAN project has been along the coast of Mersea Island off the coast of Essex. Back in the 1920s the shore of Mersea Island was protected by various sea grasses, particularly eel grass, but the heavy use of fertilisers in the 1940s polluted the estuary and killed off the eel grass leaving the shoreline exposed to erosion. Coastal biodiversity began to collapse and was made worse by the use of anti-fouling paint on boat hulls. Cockles and winkles were wiped out by the 1980s with oysters in sharp decline. Chemicals had all but destroyed a local industry which had existed since Roman times, and parts of the island are being redeposited in sand banks.\nMore information can be found at https://citizan.org.uk.",
  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_association-of-green-councillors-statement-on-investment-zones-fully-supported-by-dd-greens/content_78.html": "We desperately need investment in our local communities to insulate our homes and workplaces, to provide local jobs for local people, to provide clean and cheap renewable energy and to recover our depleted nature and weakening food systems. Our areas have crumbling services, from social care to local public transport.\nLocally agreed investment priorities, with the right incentives, could begin a green transformation of our country and support the foundational economy in our areas, without extracting wealth to corporations based in tax havens. As many nature charities say, environmental recovery, environmental monitoring and investment in natural infrastructure should be key tenets in local investment.\nInstead the government has brought forward plans that could see predatory developers and landowners riding rough-shod over agreed local priorities, further damaging our already degraded environments, and reducing commitments to affordable homes and to community facilities. These plans, rather than boosting local economies, could be a threat to existing sustainable businesses.\nWhat are Investment Zones?\n‘Investment Zones’ are a core element in the Tory ‘Growth Plan’, heralded by the now unravelling mini-budget. According to the Government “Investment Zones will accelerate the housing and infrastructure the UK needs to drive economic growth.”\nBelow we unpick this dangerous attack on the environment, on local democracy and on sustainable local economies, by looking at what the government has announced, and what this will mean.\nAttack on Nature\nThe guidance states that the aim is to “remove burdensome EU requirements”. These include Habitats Regulations and the requirement to provide an Environmental Impact Assessment, key tools in protecting nature during the planning process. Even worse, the guidance seems to allow for Investment Zones in National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and other protected environments (3.4 in Expressions of Interest Guidance). The stated expectation to ‘mitigate environmental impacts’ fails to meet the government’s own – already weak – ‘biodiversity net gain’ requirement outside investment zones.\nNo wonder the major environmental protection organisations have called into question the Government’s commitment to its own legal target to halt the decline of wildlife by 2030.\nIgnoring the climate emergency\nThe legal requirement to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 through a series of carbon targets has been completely ignored. The guidance states that “Key planning policies to ensure developments are well designed, maintain national policy on the Green Belt, protect our heritage, and address flood risk, highway and other public safety matters” will apply, but it is silent on climate change commitments. The stated intention is to “accelerate” development. To do so without explicit carbon commitments is reckless in the extreme.\nAttack on local decision making\n“The planning system will not stand in the way of investment and development”. Investment Zones “will benefit from a liberalised planning process”. This clearly means that local communities will lose their rights to resist unsustainable development. Instead, developers will get to by-pass local objections entirely. These objections are often on environmental grounds.\nCouncils spend years developing a ‘Local Plan’ that identifies where development can, and cannot, take place. The government wants to allow Investment Zones in places councils have rejected.\nBy scattering Investment Zones across the country, they will have a chilling effect on planning everywhere. Developers will insist they can’t compete against IZs without looser regulation outside the zones too.\nLess cash for communities, less affordable housing\n“We will… focus developer contributions on essential infrastructure requirements”\nCurrent rules ensure developers contribute funds for local facilities, helping Councils to provide school places, recreation, sustainable travel options and other community needs. In their place, the government “will consider” providing grants, but it is clear these too will have to be shown to support ‘growth’.\nHouse builders will avoid locally agreed requirements for affordable housing, meaning many local families, key workers and those facing homelessness will continue to be left behind. Government “will consider” financing councils to “regenerate derelict and empty housing”.\nIn both cases this could see a transfer of power away from District Councils.\nA threat to local businesses\n“Sites… could benefit from a range of time-limited tax incentives over 10 years.”\nTax breaks to developers will reduce funds for public services while undercutting local firms, poaching valuable staff, and threatening the viability of the local economy.\nWhat can be done?\n‘Expressions of Interest’ documents are being invited from Mayoral Combined Authorities (MCA) and Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLA) – County and Unitary Councils. The deadline for these is 14th October. They are expected to have ‘in principle’ agreement from the Local Planning Authority – often the District Council. This can simply be in the form of a statement by the council leader.\nThe Expressions of Interest document asks: “Do you agree in principle to ensure outstanding planning matters impeding early delivery are brought to resolution to an accelerated timetable (enabling additional delivery within the next two years)?” It later asks for confirmation that “you will agree in principle to using a new streamlined overarching planning system”. In both cases there is no room for discussion; to quote; ‘this is a Yes/No answer”!\nGreen councillors can’t possibly support a Yes answer to these questions. As Green Councillor Bridget Petty in North Somerset puts it; “This Government is a train wreck. We don’t have to go along with their train-wrecking schemes’.\nWe call on council leaders to:\n- Make plain their commitment to local control of planning.\n- Make plain that they will continue to insist on existing environmental protections and nature recovery rules – as a minimum.\nWhere council leaders insist on submitting ‘Expressions of Interest’ forms, we call on them to declare that they will:\n- Not accept a reduction in affordable housing as a percentage of overall development in their area.\n- Refuse to provide a simple ‘Yes’ to the question “Do you agree in principle to ensure outstanding planning matters impeding early delivery are brought to resolution to an accelerated timetable (enabling additional delivery within the next two years)?”\n- Refuse to provide a simple ‘Yes’ to the request to “confirm whether you will agree in principle to using a new streamlined overarching planning system”.",

More frequent heatwaves, higher than before and English farmers saying their yields knocked back by 20% in a year when threats to national food and fuel supply are hitting headlines, and, more importantly, driving up a dangerous cost of living crisis. One thing leads to another doesn’t it?\nMartin Lewis of Moneysavingexpert.com says July 2022, ‘why oh why, don’t we get homes better insulated, so we as a country, use less energy, import less energy, keep homes cool in summer and warm in winter’. He says ‘a decent govt would insulate for free all homes of families on under £25,000 and it would be much, much cheaper than paying the oil and gas giants, because the worst part of cost of living crisis is the energy bills tripling’.\nWe in the Green Party, have long, long been saying the same. Also it is completely irresponsible of the would-be prime ministerial Conservative candidates to ignore the findings of Royal Institute of International Affairs warning (Climate change risk assessment 2021 | Chatham House – International Affairs Think Tank) on the global instability, and the conflicts that the inadequately controlled climate crisis is bringing, as they fight like cats in a sack to please their unwoke small membership who prefer putting their heads in the sand.\nAccountable, responsible government, is something that we, the 67 million in the UK, the 1.5 million in Kent, could hope for, if we had a reform of our political system, the creation of constructive multi-party democracy. It would stop many of the big corporate donations to the biggest party. A multi-party, cleaned-up parliament will come when we, in England, get fair proportional voting like Scotland has already.\nYes, decisions to eat and/ or heat are linked to whether or not we turn out to vote for change at the ballot-box.

  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_betteshanger-park-development/content_185.html": "The Biodiversity At The Betteshanger Grove * (See Footnote) Site And Why It Should Be Protected\nBy Sue Sullivan\nLocally, nationally and globally we are seeing catastrophic declines in wildlife, indeed scientists believe we are in the most serious extinction crisis since the demise of the dinosaurs and predict that 1 million species could go extinct. Champions for wildlife are needed. One such champion, the American biologist, E.O. Wilson has said in his book ‘The Diversity of Life’,\n‘I will argue that every scrap of biological diversity is priceless, to be learned and cherished, and never to be surrendered without a struggle.’\nI agree. The time has come to fight for every scrap of biodiversity that remains, and every place where it resides.\nThe BETTESHANGER GROVE site bought by Quinn Estates for a housing development is one such place. Please join in the fight to save its wildlife.\nAspect Ecology who have been employed by Quinn Estates to carry out the initial ecological survey have judged the site to be of ‘low ecological value.’\nI strongly disagree. Here are my reasons:\n- The site fits the criteria for an ‘open mosaic habitat on previously developed land’. If this is indeed the case then it is classed as a priority habitat. Brown field sites, contrary to popular opinion, can be a refuge for rare species. Indeed in the north of the country several old industrial sites have been made into nature reserves. Why not Betteshanger ?\n- The site is unusual in the area because of its history as the old Betteshanger coal mine slag heap. There is very little soil on the site and the nutrient levels are low. This has resulted in an unusual flora – I have counted 100 different flowering plants growing there and there are undoubtedly more. Among the flowering plants of note are penny royal (a schedule 8 protected plant under the terms of the Wildlife and countryside Act 1981) Common cudweed – a near threatened species but common on the Betteshanger site. Bee and pyramidal orchids, common scurvy grass, carline thistle, blue fleabane, hare’s foot clover, early forget- me -not* (see footnote) .There are no records of this plant in East Kent according to the NBN Atlas.\nMany of the plants on the site are not commonly found in the local area and from a botanical view point this is not a site of ‘low ecological value.’\n- In the summer of 2019 members of the East Kent Wildlife group recorded the following birds on the site: goldfinch, house sparrow, linnet, turtle dove (an adult pair probably nesting nearby) greenfinch, song thrush, wood pigeon, blue tit, house martin, mistle thrush, blackbird, jay, willow warbler, black cap, green woodpecker, magpie.\nThe turtle dove is the UK’s fastest declining bird. The Betteshanger site , as it currently stands, provides all the requirements for turtle doves:\n- A continuous supply of seed from April to August (from all the flowering plants on site) They feed on the ground in weedy areas where the vegetation is short and sparse – as it is on large areas of the site.\n- Tall mature hedgerows, areas of scrub, woodland edges with a thick shrub layer for nesting (all present or developing at Betteshanger)\n- A water supply from the lakes on site.\nThe RSPB are running an ‘operation turtle dove’ project in Kent and Betteshanger is within one of the identified core turtle dove areas, where they are trying to encourage better habitat management for them.\nFrom an ornithological point of view this is not a site of low ecological value.\n4.Insects. I have no detailed knowledge of the insects on site but the following have been recorded in 2019:\nButterflies. Painted lady, large white, small white, gate keeper, meadow brown, holly blue, red admiral, peacock, common blue, brown argus. Clouded yellow seen on site in previous years. The common blue is a Kent Nature Partnership priority species. It was flying in good numbers last summer on the Betteshanger site accompanied by brown argos. Their larval food plants such as black medick, birds foot trefoil, dove’s foot cranesbill and common storks bill are plentiful on the site.\nOther insects. 3 types of dragon fly, several different bee species, hoverflies, bee flies, spiders, grass hoppers, crickets, cinnabar moth caterpillar, blue damselfly.\nFrom an entomological view point this is not a site of low ecological value\n- Other species present include bats , a protected species, and badgers, also protected. Unknown numbers of amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates are likely to be present as are interesting lichens , mosses and fungi.\n- The site has many, many native trees and shrubs, many planted at the time of the coalfield regeneration when Betteshanger Park was created. These include sallow, dog rose , elder, spindle, dogwood, hawthorn, oak, rowan. These provide vital habitat, nesting sites, shelter and food for a wide range of wildlife.\n- The Betteshanger site is an important stepping stone in the landscape, important as part of landscape scale conservation to connect nature rich areas, so that wildlife living in them can disperse through the landscape rather than being locked into fragmented nature reserves.\n- The Government in its 25 year plan for the environment, is buying into this idea with its requirements for nature recovery networks. Betteshanger as it currently stands, would be an ideal candidate for inclusion in such a scheme.\n- The National Planning Policy Framework ( NPPF) which provides guidance for local planning authorities on planning issues in section 7.7 ‘requires local planning authorities to enhance the natural and local environment by minimizing impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in biodiversity and ecological networks, where possible.’ The new Environment laws currently being debated in Parliament go further ; they will force developers to deliver a biodiversity net gain of at least 10% on housing schemes. Although Quinn Estates have said they will commit to this I am at a loss to see how this can be achieved on a site like Betteshanger, with its unique characteristics, when most of its biodiversity will be destroyed by housing and associated development. How would it be possible, for example, to achieve a 10% increase in the numbers and species of wildflowers that currently grow on the site ? Or a 10% increase in the number of butterflies ? Or will the destruction of the biodiversity on site be permitted to go ahead and a compensatory planting be established elsewhere ? Either way the loss of species on the site is totally unacceptable in this time of catastrophic declines.\n- Also of relevance here is the fact that Kent has missed its biodiversity target for 2010 and is likely to miss the target set for 2020. There has been a gradual loss of habitats and species in the county. For example Local Wildlife sites monitored over the past 5 years or so show 30% have been damaged and 2% lost altogether. So our local and county authorities are failing us and failing wildlife when it comes to stemming the loss of our biodiversity. Giving permission to build on a site like Betteshanger only compounds that failure.\nSo, I maintain that the Betteshanger Grove site is a significant one locally for wildlife even though it has no conservation designation. If ecologists can class such an area as being of low ecological value then British wildlife doesn’t stand a chance. And maybe it explains why so many wild places, that are valuable in a local context, are being destroyed by development. It also points to major weaknesses in a planning system that allows this to happen.\nIf local people care about the loss of biodiversity that we are currently experiencing and want to see sites like Betteshanger Grove being afforded some kind of protection then they should make their feelings known to Dover District Council, as the local planning authority, when planning permission is submitted by Quinn Estates. Both the planning submission and the ecological survey by Aspect Ecology, will be available for inspection and comment on the Dover District Council web site.\nThank you reading this and being on the side of the bats and bees and beetles.\nSue Sullivan. March 2020\nFoot notes\n* Betteshanger Grove is the name given to Quinn Estates recently acquired development site adjacent to the Circle at Betteshanger, which runs up towards the A258 Deal to Sandwich Road, along Colliers Way and Betteshanger Road.\n* Early Forget- me- not awaits confirmation of identification.",

Our responses will be seen by the national planning inspectorate, so let’s provide lots!\nThe 3 things that people keep asking DDC planners for are not in the local plan. These are:\n- Warm, locally-affordable homes in the Dover urban zone that are cheap-to-rent and cheap-to-heat,\n- An end to the choking overdevelopment on greenfield and rewilded land within 3 miles of the boundaries of profitable Deal / Walmer, (or within our Kent Downs AONB),\n- Real protection for all the carbon-capturing, wildlife-sheltering , food-providing woodland and farmland that are the foundation from which we can build back fairer and healthier from Covid, and lessen the fallout of the climate emergency ahead.\nTwo recent DDC planning decisions on 17 Dec (Cross Rd) and 25 Feb (Betteshanger) have shown that half of the planning committee have the backbone needed to question the herding /hounding by planning officers who explain repeatedly to the committee why developers need to get what they want.\nBoth questionable decisions only passed with the casting vote of the chair . In the case of Betteshanger, the evidence that the application should have been refused was overwhelming, but the planning dept dodged the refusal, with a weasel form of words. The report ‘Permission accomplished ’ published by Transparency Intl Aug 2020, looks into the relationship between England’s planning departments and volume developers (who in Kent expect a 29.34% return on their investment); DDC planning dept would do well to follow its recommendations.\nWest of Dover, all around Ashford, we see what happens when a council has a culture of nodding through applications for large, high-profit, development. With Dover’s 70% rural economy well-placed to extend its role as the fruit and vegetable garden of England, post covid, post-Brexit, we must stand firm and resist importing the Ashford example of kow-towing to Quinn and land-bankers.\nIn our Green response to the new Local Plan, we will be recommending that (viability study or no viability study),\n- only developers who are building warm homes 30% of which are locally affordable in the Dover urban zone, will be considered for ‘windfall’ development sites within 3 miles of the boundaries of high-profit Deal / Walmer;\n- that larger developments of 100+ be built zero-carbon with pockets of existing trees retained, and pockets of green space alongside each streetful of new houses;\n- that we follow the DealTC suggestions to make walking and cycling irresistible by creating safer, living streets in Dover, Deal, Aylesham, Whitfield and Sandwich;\n- that we use municipal bonds to invest in climate-friendly jobs, and make all existing homes healthy.\nA Local Plan shapes a place for a generation. Please respond to the consultation, ask for a Local Plan capable of creating a district which is fairer, cleaner and more fruitful, more coherent, a local plan whose content matches what it says on the tin.\nCllr Abi Stroud (DealTC) and Cllr John Lonsdale (WalmerPC),\nDover and Deal Green Party",
  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_save-kents-green-spaces-save-dover-districts-green-spaces/content_90.html": "Local Dover district Green party members joined other local folk and campaigners across Kent on a day of action on Sun 28 November, ‘Save Kent’s Green Spaces’.\nThirty communities across Kent took part in this big event, disgusted at the mis-use of the planning system. Of the 13 District / Borough councils in Kent, which have power as Local Planning Authorities , the 10 Conservative-led councils are coming in for many complaints from these community groups for caving in to central Conservative government decisions.\nProtest at Cottington Lakes\nHere in Dover, the protest took place north of Sholden, at Cottington Lakes where a very well known Kent developer (who has a record of making 5 figure donations to Kent Conservative parties) plans to build 975 new homes, around an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Early plans from the developer show only a quarter of the development is for young families, so 75% will be for older folks fleeing London’s corrupt property market or for financial speculation. Cottington Lakes is close to Finglesham where there were huge local protests in 2019 when this same developer proposed to build a 3000 house new town. We Greens were part of the Save Finglesham Fields campaign.\nMore honesty in planning processes\nKent residents are crying out for less deceit and much more honesty in planning processes, this includes Dover District. East Kent is not getting, either the low energy, genuinely affordable and cheap-to-rent homes in towns that local families need; nor the protection of its food-producing, carbon-absorbing, wildlife-harbouring countryside we also need. The reason is the influence of the big money of big developers that has shot up this decade, the influence that has been exposed repeatedly since 2018. In 2021 Transparency Intl UK published a report showing how national housing policy is shaped by the big developers from whom the Conservative Party received a fifth of its donations 2010-2020.\nInfluence works in many ways. Developers say they will only consider greenfield and rewilded sites which don’t require pricier clearance than brownfield sites, to keep their profit margins over 30%. The big profit margins allow them to pay public relations agencies, (such as Edelman’s) so that they can present an image that makes them look like a wildlife charity. The big profit margins allow developers to give sweetheart deals to local sports clubs and pose as local philanthropists. The big profit margins allow them to buy their own ecology surveys on sites, which grossly undervalue the wildlife and natural value of a site before a build, so that it appears, dishonestly, that they have increased its natural value when the new executive homes are finished. Deceit.\nIn many borough councils outside Kent, planning regulations have been adopted to make all new homes low or zero carbon, Reading BC is an example*, but in attractive Kent, which high-profit developers focus on, council planners are discouraged by developers from ruling that 30% of building within town boundaries be affordable, bleating about viability. Discouraged too from planning low-carbon building because it also would reduce profit margins below 28%. Records also show how big developers promise X, Y and Z to get planning permission, but often two or 3 years later, ask planning committees to remove the planning conditions requiring X, Y and Z protections for local services and environment. This is more likely to happen if some members of planning committees have friends in the development business.\nWe need increased transparency\nAnother report from Transparency Intl UK, says we need “increased transparency (=less hidden agendas), tighter rules, strengthened oversight”, in its 2020 report ‘Permission accomplished: assessing corruption risks in local government planning’. These are the issues behind action taken by 30 communities in Kent on 28 Nov, Save Kent’s Green Spaces.

Vulnerable aging communities in Dover and Thanet districts could in future be ruled from Ashford or Canterbury depending on where the new East Kent Unitary is based. You may have seen our public letters in the local Press 8 /9 Jan in the Mercury and Dover Express Letters pages.\nWe think there are many reasons to expect that the changes will deepen poverty levels in our vulnerable aging coastal communities instead of reducing them. It seems that Deal, Walmer, Dover, Ramsgate, Margate, Folkestone and Hythe towns and villages will find themselves far from the new Unitary Council decision-making in 3 years time. And will need to find new ways to stand up for themselves in front of the Unitary and Mayoral authorities and to call them to account.\nIt is very likely that Conservative leader Roger Gough of what is now the dying KCC will agree within days with another Ministerial decision (a.k.a. diktat) of Angela Rayner (Housing, Communities & Local Gov. ) to cancel KCC 2025 elections so that his Conservative party shapes the new administrations in his parties interest. He has not been happy that in 2023 and 2024 Green and Independent groups were voted in to take control of Folkestone and Hythe, Ashford and Maidstone Councils and were part of Swale BC administration until Labour Minister Rayner overruled the planning policy of SwaleBC. Currently there are 53 district level Green councillors in Kent and 5 county level councillors, working their socks off. And many more Green Party people elected to Town and Parish Councils where councillors work on a voluntary basis.\nNone of this change has had parliamentary process, all of it has happened by Ministerial decision in 3 weeks flat over the festive break without any details of funds to come to councils, a chalice offered by Labour Government in London to Kent Conservatives, convenient for both. The day after the vote at KCC, one councillor at DDC, C Woodgate, defected from majority group to the opposition Conservative group, presumably thinking that the decision on 9th January did advantage the Conservative Party and if selected as a Conservative candidate before the elections to the new Unitary Councils it might benefit him. Basic councillor allowances at KCC are currently £16,000.\nHuge thanks will be due to local government officers who chose to keep vital services running while Kent is thrown in at the deep end to this sea of unpredictable change. It is change which is so convenient for the property developers that the new Labour government seems unwilling to regulate or guide towards building the social housing that is cheap-to-rent or buy, cheap-to-heat and energy efficient, close to services that young families can walk or cycle to. We have a Labour government that seems very unaware of how much communities in the garden of England need their green spaces and food-growing fields, woodland flood sponges, carbon-capturing, wildlife-harbouring grassland and wetlands.\n‘The whole process stinks of some banana regime; some would say both big parties have betrayed the people of East Kent, who have blatantly been excluded from this top-speed decision-making process’, said Cllr Sarah Waite-Gleave.\nChristine Oliver, Dover and Deal Green Party parliamentary spokesperson said, ‘We pledge to keep working to support our vulnerable coastal and rural communities in East Kent and to do our utmost to use all means possible to hold the new authorities to account.

Like many across England, they asked their local council to stand up with them against the betrayals by the central chaotic Conservative government.\nThe two environmental betrayals are the #AttackOnNature denounced by Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB since 23rd Sept 2022 and the lifting of the Fracking moratorium announced by Liz Truss’s Business Minister the same week. (There are many other betrayals relating to the crashing of the economy and sending cost of living crisis into overdrive).\nThe campaigners’ action was in support of 2 questions from members of the public on the agenda. Pete Findley of Mongeham asked DDC cabinet for evidence that DDC were genuinely providing protections for wildlife habitats with the new Dover Local Plan due to go for its second public consultation between 21 October and 9 December. Sarah Waite-Gleave asked the DDC cabinet to renew their 2013 commitment to oppose fracking for shale or methane gas and the poisoning of the water table hydrologists / geologists consider is likely to accompany it in Kent’s fragile chalk aquifers.

We need a recorded vote on this issue.’\nThe response from the Conservative majority was voiced by the cabinet member for Finance, Governance, Digital and Climate Change, Cllr Chris Vinson, who said, “This council isn’t ultimately the decision maker. . . , we are a statutory consultee. The name escapes me of the arms length body that deals with licensing, they and KCC are involved. When and if an application comes up, our response should reflect all the concerns [water resources, roads, traffic, lights ] we had in 2013.

Our current policy is reasonable and should stand, but I can’t support this motion.\nThe vote was as follows:\n- Abstentions 4\nBond\nChandler\nHannent\nCollor\n(Conservatives absent: Back, Manion, Kenton, Richardson ) - For 10\nBeer\nBiggs\nBrivio\nCronk\nHaste\nKeen\nMills\nWilliams\nWoodgate\nWalker\n(Labour absent Jones, Zosseder ) - Against 12\nBartlett\nBates\nBeaney\nFriend\nVinson\nConelly\nHawkes\nHibbert\nJull\nMurphy\nRose\nWalkden - Total 32 cllrs\nSarah Waite-Gleave said afterwards: ‘since 23 Sept 2022, Conservative councils across England have been voting to oppose fracking, to put community before party to distance themselves from Conservative chaos in Westminster. Most recently at West Sussex County council on 14 Oct they voted to oppose fracking, which does nothing for energy bills or fuel security. Alas Dover Conservative cabinet have chosen tonight to put party before community and Ms Elphicke in parliament has also put party before the future health of her constituents tonight too.’",

They say our world is currently on course for worse levels of global climate disturbance than were targeted, (2.7 to 3degrees of warming), with only 1% chance of meeting 1.5 degrees warming targeted by UN summit in 2015.\nAs a consequence, Chatham house experts are looking at ‘cascading system risks’, which are likely, tragically, to lead to world agricultural yields falling by 30%, and 700million people exposed to severe drought. They say net zero carbon pledges by national governments are far from enough. “Cascading climate impacts will likely cause higher mortality rates, drive political instability and greater national insecurity, and fuel regional and international conflict.”\nThe good news is that, across Britain, even if not yet in Dover district or East Kent, councils are coming together, with local civil society, using the resource hub of Zero Carbon Britain based in Wales, shaped for and by determined local councils.\nExamples from British local government include; Aberdeen, Lewes District Council, Stroud District council, Shropshire CC and Shropshire Climate Action Partnership, Welsh Govt, Nottingham City Council, Bristol, Norwich, Oxfordshire CC, Brighton and many others.\nSadly, in Kent there are too many local councils who brush aside the nature-based solutions to climate change that a 143 page report recommends for Kent, and too many councillors from old, complacent parties, who can’t even bother to turn up to climate committee meetings they sit on, who refuse to take large-scale action to insulate unhealthy homes in our towns to save tenants from fuel-poverty and make homes healthier.\nMany of us, during the world climate summit in Glasgow, will be demanding our councils act now, this climate issue is not about public relations opportunities for those in power or deckchairs on the Titanic; there are large-scale, life-saving, life-changing, cost-effective policies that councils need to put in place now.\nSarah Gleave,Dover & Deal Green Party\nNote: Edited version published in Mercury 20th Oct 2021.",

People whose life is made unbearable are more likely to make life-risking decisions and be exploited by criminal people smugglers. Safe, legal routes would stop the market in people-smuggling. - People seeking asylum in the UK have to comply with strong immigration rules and provide high-level evidence to be successful.\n- 85% of the world’s refugees are hosted in impoverished countries. The proportion of refugees who travel to Europe is tiny on a world scale, and an even smaller proportion come and claim asylum in the UK.\n- UK is the only country on this continent where indefinite detention is legal. It locks up people while their case is being processed, before it is proved that they are not allowed to stay in Britain. And on appeal nearly half of those locked up are judged to have legal grounds to stay.\nGreen Party national polices to end hostile environment\nP39 2019 Green Party Manifesto\nWe would ‘Scrap the Home Office, and end its decades-long creation of a hostile environment for Black Minority Ethnic (BME) and other minority communities.

  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_what-does-brexit-mean-for-live-animal-exports/content_141.html": "Written by Keith Taylor, Green Party MEP, Autumn 2017\nLive exports are barbaric; treating beautiful and sentient animals as ‘goods’ no different from a bottle of whiskey or bar of chocolate. Greens want to see it banned outright.\n“Animals exported live for slaughter and breeding often travel great distances, for days at a time, in confined spaces, and suffer great distress, dehydration, disease, fatigue, and injury.”\nLive transportation and the suffering it wreaks is entirely unnecessary. Current European Union legislation provides protections for animals in transit. But they become problematic when the destination is outside of the European Union.\nEU regulations, for example, make it illegal for pigs to be kept in confined sow stalls when travelling within Europe, but not once they cross EU borders.\nRecently, there has been a buzz of excitement amongst some British animal welfare activists who believe leaving the EU might finally offer an opportunity to ban live exports outright. Greens are the first to acknowledge that the rules of the Single Market are a barrier to banning the industry outright.\nIn theory, therefore, the argument is that leaving the Single Market would mean the UK is free to ban live animal exports. The Government, proponents say, would then have to listen to the overwhelming majority of British people who support such a ban.\nIt’s a tempting scenario, but it doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Ignoring the disastrous economic consequences and the loss of vital environmental, workers’ rights and even animal welfare protections — if Theresa May pursues an extreme Brexit — Britain will become an independent member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\nAs a member of the WTO, it is as likely — if not more likely — that live animal exports will increase rather than decrease. The WTO governs the conditions, rules, and regulation of trade between countries.\nThere is currently no means by which WTO members can restrict trade on animal welfare grounds.”\nMuch like the EU’s Single Market, WTO membership enshrines the principles of free\nmovement of trade — including live animals. Any attempts to ban live exports, therefore,\ncan be swept aside.\nOther WTO member states, particularly those that profit from live exports, can also challenge any proposed ban if they see it as a barrier to trade. It is the WTO that stops the EU from banning the import of eggs from barren battery cages, despite the cruel farming practice being banned across the EU.\nThe best thing that we, as passionate, animal-loving Brits, can do is to continue fighting\nto strengthen animal welfare standards as members of the EU. We already have the necessary legislative tools at our disposal to help us in the fight — they were a gift from the EU, afforded to us by virtue of our membership.\nThe EU-wide #StopTheTrucks campaign is calling on the EU Commission to review and update transport regulations. Ultimately, the campaign demands that the trade in live animals be replaced with a trade in meat.\nUntil that happens, they are calling for the duration of any live transports to be\ncapped at eight hours — an effective ban on live exports from the UK. Austria, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands have all submitted an official request in support of the campaign and, so far, the campaign’s online petition has garnered the signatures of over a million EU citizens.\nEU legislation has significantly improved on-farm conditions for millions of animals, from banning veal crates and sow stalls to stopping the use of barren battery cages; we can’t afford to lose these protections.\nWe are stronger working with our friends and neighbours, and we can — and should — continue to fight as part of the EU with the strength that our membership brings.\nSign the UK petition now: the issue will be debated in parliament on 28 February 2018.",

Their purpose was to show that the cost of living crisis is deep and dangerous and that it is in fact a cost of greed crisis, caused by the huge bonuses and tax avoidance of big Gas and Oil corporations. Big Gas & Oil have registered record profits recently. Shell for example had a profit of 9.13billion dollars in 1st quarter 2022, and BP recorded similar gains(1). Huge profits were registered while they both have been failing to pay tax on North Sea earnings (2).\nSuch huge, untaxed profits enable Big Gas and Oil companies to lobby our UK govt (and our MPs) generously, when they wish to do so. It enables them to mount public relations campaigns,\n- that argue governments shouldn’t bring in a windfall tax on energy companies (although polls suggest 76% of the public are in favour of such windfall taxes),\n- that pretend it is too expensive for a government to reduce Britian’s energy needs and cut energy bills by investing in comprehensive mass home insulation,\n- that pretend renewable energy is not the cheapest and fastest way of creating home-grown energy\n- that decry the cost and speed advantages of clean renewable energy which reduces the climate crisis,\n- that deny the climate crisis threats to sea level rise in East Kent, and to harvests in Europe and Kent.\nOpposition politicians, such as Green co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, are calling for an all party summit meeting to deal with the urgent issues of food and fuel security in 2022 (3).\nThe protestors in Broadstairs on 21st included supporters of Kent Climate Action Coalition, local food charity volunteers, Save our NHS in Kent, Thanet Greens, Dover Greens, SWP, Thanet Left, East Kent Against Fracking and East Kent Climate Action.\nThe office of MP MacKinlay was chosen because this year he has actively promoted the view that Britain needs to increase its reliance on gas & oil, instead of reducing it as fast as possible. He is a member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which decries the evidence of almost all scientists and the IPCC reports on climate change, and challenges the commitments made by Britain during COP26 in Glasgow claiming they cause price rises (4). However all logical reasoning shows the cheapest energy is the energy saved by those who can afford to insulate their homes.\nAlas! our low wage economy means 27% of children in the UK in 2020/21 live in poverty (higher in Thanet and Dover districts), and those most affected by hikes in energy bills are unable to invest to upgrade their homes (5).\nMike Garner, leader of Green Party group on Conservative-led Thanet District Council said, “In fact price rises are due to UK government failures to stand up to big gas and oil companies, and the failure to insulate the UK’s poor housing stock at scale”. Some of the calls by protesters that drew support from passers-by included, “Who pays Craig?”, “Whose planet ? Our Planet!”, “Insulate now!”, “We despise, MacKinlay’s lies.”\nSharon Goodyer of Our Kitchen in Isle of Thanet, was one of 6 public speakers at the protest. She told the group of 50-60 protestors how the choice between eating and heating is hitting many in Thanet South and Thanet North very hard.\nShe said “our non-profit has 3500 families and individuals registered for food help. Some people still don’t understand that food support and food banks serve people who are registered as needing help. The scale of the problem has become much too big for charities to solve, government must act on the cost of living crisis. On Mon 23 May I will be at parliament talking to decision makers and presenting some practical ideas on how government could help quickly to ease food poverty. For example, if government funded staff to work two extra hours a day in kitchens with school meals services and with non-profits and charities like ours, we could upscale fast to provide more locally-grown, healthy affordable food by this autumn.”\nMore protests are planned, in East Kent. Also in London a big demonstration focusing on the cost of living crisis is planned for 18th June, called by the TUC.

Our manifesto promised ‘to increase rail freight capacity’, ‘ensuring good railway connections with all ports to enable more freight between ports and inland terminals to be carried on rail. We will invest in additional freight routes resulting in the majority of long-distance freight switching from road to rail.’ Our neighbours across the channel in France are taking action on this issue. On 27 July 2020, French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced the reopening of one line, Perpignan (Pyrenees) to Paris region, and a call for projects for two more new rail lines, Sete (Mediterranean) to Calais, and Bayonne to Cherbourg with investment funds committed. In the meantime, the French Government is investing €63 million in 2020 and another €63 million in 2021 on the tolls that freight trains pay the SNCF rail network to get 20,000 HGVs off the French roads in 2021. This is action for a Green recovery. The French Prime Minister might have been nudged in this direction by the Green wins in local elections in June 2020. Europe-Ecologie/Les Verts (EELV) won the mayoralties and became the largest party (mostly alone, also in coalitions) in key towns including Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Poitiers, Besançon, Annecy, Grenoble, Paris and Montpellier. More motivation for us Greens to campaign to win in English county elections 2021? You bet. In English shire counties, often with large Conservative majorities, many of us fully recognise the campaigning work of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE). Its 2020 campaign to ‘decarbonise transport for the countryside’ with its list of eight key asks of central government includes the statement: ‘Freight should be shifted from road haulage and HGVs to electrified rail services’. Alas, British rail statistics 2020 showed rail freight at its lowest for 23 years and the General Secretary of RMT union Mick Cash said: “The government must ensure we get rail freight back on the rails and that this vital sector is fully supported as part of an integrated transport strategy that will become even more vital as part of the country’s post-Covid revival.” We know from members who work in freight and rail that tunnels north of Kent’s HS1 are currently too low to take wagons with containers, so infrastructure improvements would need to include digging down and re-laying line. This is entirely doable. The threat of what will happen if the bunglers in Britain’s central government don’t take action, is urgent and extreme in East Kent, in Dover District, where I am a local Green Party co-ordinator. East Kent, its orchards, its seaside towns and its deprived housing estates, are threatened with 7,000 HGVs from two huge lorry parks in Thanet (Manston) and Dover (Whitfield), with two more lorry parks planned in Ashford for 2,950 lorries on the doorstep of East Kent’s main hospital. The threat includes three crawling queues of lorries on A20, A2, and A256 into Dover, roads familiar to anyone who has ever travelled through our spectacular, cliff-edge district to catch a ferry. Nobody deserves to have to suck up the levels of pollution these crawling lorry lines will produce. So let’s change central government plans for all of the UK’s towns and ports. Let’s campaign with distanced flash-mobs, on the streets, on-line, however we can, for a green, climate-friendly recovery and de-carbonised transport with freight-to-rail. Action now please!",

The developers constructing on the steep area by the allotments on Folkestone Road have decided to go way beyond the planning application conditions. This is a development by Enzo’s Homes. Why would these developer get the idea that planning conditions don’t matter ? Is it due to the announcements about pleasing developers coming out of the new government in Westminster?\nThe local residents are very unhappy about the damage to the lovely environment in Elms Vale area of Dover Town, right on the edge of Kent Downs AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) / National Landscapes, a designation that should provide extra planning protection. Residents are concerned about damage to wildlife and biodiversity caused by the developers going beyond the area permitted.\nIn the week of 19th to 23rd Aug a planning enforcement stop notice had to be issued (ENF/24/00185). Our Green Party campaigner Steph O’Connor, stepped in to contact the Leader of DDC, Cllr Kevin Mills on the issue and got a detailed and prompt reply:\n“Dover District Council has served a temporary stop notice in respect of the site at land South West of Allotments in Folkestone Road, Dover, and land on the west side of Church Road, Dover, requiring unauthorised carrying out of operational development including engineering works relating to terracing, compaction and regrading of spoil within the site to cease. The notice takes effect today, 23rd August 2024 and will cease to have effect on 18th October 2024.\nThe reason for issuing this notice is because the development, by virtue of its sensitive location within the Kent Downs National Landscape and its countryside location, has resulted in a prominent and unsympathetic alteration to the site and wider landscape, failing to conserve or enhance the landscape and scenic beauty of the National Landscape and the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside.” Cllr Kevin Mills.\nSteph, other Green campaigners in Dover and local residents are continuing to monitor the situation carefully and will be prompt to protest any additional damage to the green space they love so much.\nOf course Dover town and other coastal communities across the UK are crying our for genuinely affordable and council houses which are cheap to heat and close to services. This is what the Green Party has campaigned for, the Right homes in the Right Place at the Right Price. To achieve these solutions to the homelessness crisis a determined approach to planning by central government and by Local Planning Authorities is needed. Not posturing to pretend to the property development lobby that they will have everything their own way.",
  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_walmer-town-council-install-four-new-electric-vehicle-charge-points/content_92.html": "A bank of four new EV Charge Points have been installed off Canada Road in Walmer by Walmer Town Council, in conjunction with Kent County Council and operators Connected Kerb. The charging points, on the right of the access road to Deal & Betteshanger Rugby Club, are primarily for use by local residents without off-street parking, so they can charge their current and future electric cars without the need for their own drive. Two of the chargers are 7kW, and two are 22kW – the fastest chargers in the Walmer and Deal area. Electric Vehicle drivers can simply pull up, plug in and use the Connected Kerb app to start charging.\nCouncillor John Lonsdale, Chair of the Climate Emergency Working Group at Walmer Town Council, says, “Charging infrastructure is a key factor in encouraging us all to switch from fossil fuel vehicles over to electric. Those without private parking shouldn’t be excluded from this. Going electric is an essential move to meet carbon emissions targets in the fight against global heating. Walmer has been a black hole for charge points up to now, but the four just put in by the Town Council, plus two more in the Deal Memorial Car Park that we lobbied Dover District Council for, are a very important starting point. Walmer will need many more in future and the Town Council will do all it can to help make it happen”\nThe EV charge points were installed as part of Walmer Town Council’s Climate Emergency commitment. Councillors hope local residents and visitors will be reassured charging infrastructure is on the way and that the time to switch to electric cars is now. The Climate Emergency Working Group is also lobbying for electric buses in Walmer, for those who can’t afford an electric vehicle or have chosen not to run a car at all.\nOther ongoing climate-related schemes at the Town Council include introducing secure cycle parking at Walmer station, increasing biodiversity in the local area, giving residents access to free outdoor exercise machines and providing equipment for residents to assess where insulation is needed in their homes. The Council is also in the process of retrofitting Walmer’s new office to make it a low energy, sustainable, healthy building to use over the long-term.",

Whilst nine trees are proposed to be removed to allow the Aldi development to come forward, Aldi will be replacing these with 13 mature specimens throughout the site, w’hich will be supported by the required infrastructure to allow them to grow successfully within the car park and ensure their longevity.\n“Overall, the additional trees and landscaping proposed, in addition to the introduction of a modem and highly sustainable Aldi building, will regenerate the site and enhance the local Conservation Area setting. We are delighted that an overwhelming number of local people have already shown their support for the proposals and can’t wait for Aldi to open.”\nAldi will submit a planning application to Dover District Council this month.

Comparing the draft on the agenda for the cabinet meeting 11th Jan with earlier drafts, the document looks thin and very underfunded (£475K is the value of a single high-end dwelling) compared to strategies and action plans from other borough councils in England. Problems are not solved by pretence.\nWe are also saddened that the one-party cabinet at DDC has not chosen to follow national guidelines which recommend participative democratic involvement of communities, citizens and parishes in local climate crisis response plans. The population of 118K (electorate 88K) deserve much more genuine democratic involvement. We are very concerned that DDC’s plans for regeneration through large-scale urbanisation of East Kent and the cosy relationship between the DDC Planning dept and billionaire construction firms will not meet the need to retain woodland, fenland and farmland (carbon sinks and food production) (which is the recommendation of the Climate Coalition, Greenpeace, Zero Carbon Britain and the Woodland Trust). See DDC new Local Plan whose lockdown-constrained on-line consultation will run 20 Jan to 17th March.\nWe will continue to engage constructively with the DDC cabinet at climate working group meetings and continue to put the case for action on the climate and ecological emergency which is robust, honestly-measured, and responsive to communities and citizens across the district. Climate action is much less effective when imposed top-down. This is especially the case in a district where the Conservative majority on the District council were elected by less than half of 22 to 40 % of the electorate (varies according to ward). Similarly, at county level, the current Conservative majority were elected by less than half of 27 to 35 % of the Dover district electorate (varies according to division). So we will continue to campaign for more voice for citizens and communities on all matters, including the climate and ecological emergency and post-covid recovery.\nNote for editors: DDC CC Strategy is downloadable from DDC website > meetings > Cabinet 11 Jan 2021 > Agenda papers",

And in England and Wales Greens have shot up to 753 higher level councillors, with 200 net gains!\nIf you look at which wards we used our limited resources in, you’ll see we focussed on taking Conservative seats. We apologise if you live in a ward where we were not able this time to stand a candidate, we keep growing and hope to stand more candidates next time. Perhaps you could join us to help in our efforts to grow?",

Our colleagues in Folkestone and Hythe have shown the way forward, increasing democracy and reducing control-freakery,” said Christine Oliver, Dover and Deal’s Green prospective parliamentary candidate.\nFolkestone & Hythe District Council (FHDC) has become the first in Kent to be controlled by the Green Party.

The Conservatives, who have run the council for 16 years, were reduced to five.\nCllr Jim Martin, voted in as Leader of the council at the annual meeting of the council on 24 May, said: “People across Folkestone & Hythe district will get the change they demanded from a new council ready to listen, involve and act in their best interests, with Greens, Labour and LibDems closely aligned on key issues, such as cancelling the unwanted Princes Parade development.”\nDover and Deal Green Party sends huge congratulations to Shepway Green Party.\nTo loud cheers from the public gallery, the meeting heard an announcement from Cllr Martin that Princes Parade is saved – answering years of calls from campaigners opposed to the seafront development at Hythe. Greens, Labour and LibDems had all promised to cancel the scheme.\nCllr Martin told the annual meeting: “Those of you who remember the meeting of the council in June 2019 will recall that [LibDem]Councillor [Tim] Prater’s motion to withdraw the planning permission for Princes Parade was successful, but this decision was never included on the agenda for ratification by the cabinet. This flagrant breach of the democratic process has led to the waste of millions of pounds of local people’s money. The new council is determined to enhance and reinforce the democratic processes within the council and the organisations that it owns or funds.”\nGreen Party councillors will occupy seven of the nine places on the council’s decision-making cabinet, with the other two going to the LibDems, but it was also announced that FHDC will replace the leader and cabinet system with a committee system as part of the new council’s emphasis on the democratic process. The change, in a year’s time, will give councillors’ more say and more ability to influence council policy. Until then, Labour will chair the council and its four existing committees.\nSaid Cllr Martin: “I am looking forward now to getting on with the work and starting to deliver the things we promised voters.”\nThe party’s manifesto set out priorities including doing as much as possible to provide green jobs and support for high streets and other local businesses, to work in partnership with community groups to support vulnerable people and those hit by the cost-of-living crisis and publishing an action plan to help homeless people all year round.\nThe manifesto also included doing everything possible to provide affordable homes that are cheaper to heat and to insulate all council housing to reduce energy bills and to secure more biodiversity on council land and net carbon zero council buildings. The party also said it wants to improve recycling rates, reduce waste and encourage reuse, as well as seeking active travel schemes that make walking, cycling and wheelchair or rollator use safer and more enjoyable.\nShepway Green Party now has a record number of councillors – 12 at Hythe Town Council, eleven at Folkestone & Hythe District Council and, following its substantial victory in March’s Kent County Council by-election, one county councillor.",

Since February 2022, immediately after the budget cut was voted through by the Conservative majority group at KCC, local Green Party campaigners have been working to encourage KCC not to cut bus services used by school children and commuters and village residents of all ages.\nDover and Deal Green Party campaigners launched a petition in February 2022, Save Dover districts bus services https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/save-dover-districts-bus-services-and-bus-services-across-kent/\nA local resident, David Stirrup, between Eastry and Woodnesborough, said ‘the bus cuts are causing a lot of worry among people who commute to Canterbury’.\nA resident of Elvington said “with bus cuts for school children, how am I supposed to drive one child to Canterbury and another child to Sandwich at the same time in the morning, or get my elderly mother to her GP while I’m working”.\nFrom Kingsdown resident, “We received notification from Dover secondary schools last week that following cuts to funding from KCC, Stagecoach will stop operating school bus services out of Kingsdown in the morning (which allow the children to connect to the Dover buses in Walmer) and the bus which operates to get them home in the afternoon. As a result children from the village will no longer be able to independently travel to schools, and they will need lifts in cars.”\nTom Gale of Preston Parish Council; has protested about the harm the cutting of the 11 bus service will cause young and old people, so has Mike Coleman of Stourmouth PC.

It is truly frightening to think of more people trying to walk on village lanes in dark winter afternoons, with more cars on the road”.

The removal of public transport will create a potentially irreversible shift in the demographics of our villages and rural areas as they increasingly become populated solely by people with access to a car and the ability to drive it.\nIn addition to the hundreds of residents who are already heavily reliant on buses, we met with many others who currently drive a car but could see a point in the near future where they felt they would not be safe to drive and, understandably, would like to be able to rely on a regular bus service to maintain their independence.\nMany of our villages are also losing young families due to the lack of affordable housing in rural areas, and this decision will only accelerate that trend.\nWe welcome the proposal to retain the Kent Karrier service to mitigate some of the damage from these cuts, but it is a very expensive safety net with some pretty massive holes.",

John carried the responsibility of chair of the WTC Climate Change Working Group. He is a Dover District Council (DDC) Green Party candidate in Guston, Kingsdown and St Margarets in the May 2023 local elections.\nThe work at Walmer station has been two years in the planning with John keeping in close contact with Nina Peak and Steve Cross of Southeastern. It was originally planned as an outdoor hub within a secure cage, but the plan was later changed for the hub to become part of the original station building.\nThe project will cater for 24 bikes. Users will get a key fob access for a yearly fee and the facility will include a bike pump, repair kit, lock rings, CCTV and lighting.\nCllr John Lonsdale of WalmerTC said, “This new secure cycle storage is brilliant news. I was determined to get something done when I heard of school students and others returning on the train of an evening to find their cycles stolen or vandalized. Now they can do without car lifts or car parking, use their bikes to get to their train, knowing it will be safe while they’re at work or at school. This will keep them healthier, saving money, reducing carbon emissions and car jouneys and traffic congestion. Walmer Town Council committed to encouraging cycling as part of its Climate Emergency declaration and this investment is part of that commitment. The funding from Cycle Rail Fund has helped a lot. Big thanks go to all my fellow Walmer councillors for supporting the scheme and to Nina Peak of Southeastern for guiding it through.” Cllr John Lonsdale at Walmer stationIt was surprising to see a Conservative DDC candidate, and ex DDC councillor, in April 2023 implying on social media that the work of getting Walmer cyclists the security they need was his. The prospect of some losses by the Conservative Party that has had so very much control of DDC and KCC for well over a decade, seems to be causing some very wild untruthful statements to be made / implied this spring.\nSo for the record:\n- Walmer Council 2019 – 2023 has been chaired by 3 people; Independent Cllr S Lechevalier (ex Conservative) 2019-2020; Independent Cllr J Murray 2020 – 2022; Green Cllr M Eddy 2022-2023.\n- There has been considerable agreement from most (12 or 13) Cllrs out of 15. There has never been more than 3 Grn Cllrs on WTC and between Dec 2020 and summer 2021 it was 2.\n- Walmer TC has not increased the parish precept by 97%. Careful maths show that if the precept is taken for the whole council tax increase (Conservative run KCC, DDC, Police, Fire and Social care Supplement) for 2019/20 this gives an increase of 83.98% between then and 23/24. Between 21/20 and 23/24 the percentage increase is 91.94%. No wonder Mr Sunak is worried about maths skills.\nThe parish council tax precept for Walmer is less than that of Deal, Sandwich or Dover level 1 councils. If Conservatives say they will freeze the local precept while we have 10% inflation this implies a cut in services; which services will they cut?\n- Walmer Councillors of all colours 2019-2023 worked hard and cooperatively to continue running fantastic events. How rude to imply they didn’t.\n- Greens on Walmer TC have supported local residents who want to see a peace garden at York & Albany Close instead of building. There has also been evaluation by KWT of other sites, as prospective urban wildlife corners.\n- There was a public town meeting on 19th April 2023. Visibly most of the councillors had not resigned. It was a pleasant evening with a number of presentations, including to retiring ex Chair Sue LeChevalier, and a very civil and informative question and answer session. One of the presentations was to Mark Simpson, Conservative cllr on WalmerTC, representing the Royal Marines Association on the Strand.\n- WTC councillors who served 2019-2023 should not be expected to apologise for not being a one-party dominated council or for upholding the Nolan principles generally and specifically on integrity “They [holders of public office] should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.” Most (around 12 or 13 out of 15) of the public-spirited 2019-2023 Walmer Council have cooperated so that Walmer now has a publicly-owned asset, a functional set of offices with a separate committee room, instead of a non-functional office paid from public funds using an expensive lease that would never become an asset except for the landlady, who was one of the Conservative leaders of Walmer council in 2013, when the advantageous lease was set up.\n- The 2019-2023 Walmer Council worked cooperatively to keep open green spaces; especially during the consultations on the DDC (Conservative-led) Local Plan. There’s no question of building either at York and Albany Close or at the Drill Field. How unkind to worry residents in the vicinity of these locations. Walmer Council objected strongly to Conservative-led DDC on the possibility of developing Ray’s Bottom on Liverpool Road and to the developments around Cross Road, and to other overdevelopment on greenfield sites. This overdevelopment authorised by Conservative-led DDC is seen by many residents as the cause of much of the dangerous traffic congestion on A258 and surrounding residential streets in 2023. The 3 Green Party candidates seeking election to Walmer TC, Pete Findley, Sarah Gleave and Mike Eddy, hope to be in a better position to continue supporting Walmer Road Safety Group if elected to the local council.",

The two venues hosted two book-signing events by Natalie Bennett, a Green life peer, Baroness Bennett of Manor Castle, and author of ‘Change Everything’ an easily readable introduction to Green Party policies.\nTwo lively question and answer sessions took place and issues that came up included increasing Britain’s food and energy security, shifting to a well-being economy, wealth redistribution through a wealth tax of 2% on billionaires, restoring public services, less lobby-laden central government, natural solutions to climate change that would protect the garden of England from floods, fires and droughts and the enjoyment of participating in local community campaigns.\nChristine Oliver, local parliamentary spokesperson for the Green Party, was the organiser of the events. A recently selected candidate in the upcoming 2025 Kent County Council elections for the Deal and Walmer area, Christine commented,\n“It was inspiring to hear Natalie Bennett speaking about hope in what can seem like very dark times. She reminded us that politics is the many people taking action to make their communities better and more resilient. It is community litter-picks and repair cafes, it is campaigning to keep our local bus routes and leisure centres. We can all help to make a fairer future.”\nBooks were, and still are, on sale thanks to The Deal Bookshop on Deal High Street.",

It passed a decision that chairmanship of the council would automatically rotate and a new councillor would be elected as chair every two years; a decision reached after councillors had seen the problems that arise when a single powerful councillor holds sway for almost two decades.\nThe new 2019 Walmer council (3 of them Greens) all agreed variety was the spice of local accountable democracy, (with one exception, the councilor who was the previous long-standing Conservative chair).\nSince 2019, the three chairs of Walmer council have been Cllr Sue Lechevallier, (now an independent cllr) 2019-2020, Cllr James Murray (Ind) 2020 to May 2022, and Cllr Mike Eddy (Grn) who became chair of Walmer council in May 2022, supported by cllr Beard-Gould (Ind) as vice chair.\nWalmer councillors declared a climate emergency unanimously on 3rd July 2019, with a private motion proposed by cllrs Eddy, Lonsdale and Symons, three Greens on the new council (item 5761). The council committed to becoming a carbon neutral organisation by 2025. Work to implement this commitment has been led by the team on Walmer Council’s Climate Emergency Working Group, chaired by Cllr John Lonsdale (Grn).\nIn addition to lowering the council’s carbon footprint, much work has been done in the community. In the 3 years since 2019 they have leveraged in KCC money to provide EV electric vehicle charging points for visitors and residents who don’t have off-street parking. They compiled and distributed a local advice sheet in 2019 for residents about planning processes and energy efficient homes. By autumn 2021 they’d set up a service for a Walmer council employee to bring a thermal camera to residents’ homes and help them decide how to make their home more energy efficient.\nWith energy prices going sky-high in 2022, those who have benefitted from WalmerTC support on energy efficiency are counting their lucky stars! WTC also leveraged in rail funding so that security cameras and strong cycle lock-ups could be installed at Walmer station. And with ever-increasing congestion on the suburban roads of Walmer and Deal, making cycling easier and safer makes very good sense.\nA problem the incoming team of 2019 councillors were determined to tackle was the secretive lease signed in 2013 when Cllr Pat Heath (Conservative) was chair, which awarded a 25 year commercial lease to ex-cllr Mrs Johnson (Conservative), then vice-chair of Walmer Parish Council. (see reply to Freedom of Information request below). Cleaning up this historical problem (the 2013 decision contravened the Nolan principles of public service, the Code of conduct about ‘cllrs not to make any decision in their own pecuniary (financial) interest’ and the legal advice provided to council) has involved the Walmer council moving to new publicly-owned council premises, resolving the on-going costs of ex-cllr Johnson’s lease and referring the matter to the police authorities (minuted item 6315 of meeting 2ndFeb 2022; a statement about cllr Heath is on the Walmer TC website).\nCllr Mike Eddy said, “We of Walmer Town council will continue to work together to enable residents to enjoy Walmer’s beautiful environment and facilities and we’ll work to improve them. We will continue to listen to and stand up for residents. We’ll keep trying to get DDC and KCC to take action to protect Walmer, particularly on the issues of road safety, planning and overdevelopment that are affecting our community. This council team are determined to respect the principles of clean, accountable governance”.\nHe continued, “We hear from our Green colleagues elected to Deal and Dover town councils that all too often, it is only recommendations from the majority groups (Labour) that get accepted at full council, while well-researched practical recommendations from our councillors are dropped into the long-grass. At a higher level, on Dover district council, we watch the six man Cabinet (Conservative) brush aside the work of councillors not of their party. This is why the mutual respect for diversity which allows councillors of different backgrounds to work constructively together here in Walmer, is something we think is well worth celebrating.”",

The week earlier this story was on the front page of the local press with quotes from Gerry and Jill Carter and Sea Café owner Pete St Ange, pointing out there are fears that Deal / Walmer could be hit with a do-not-swim warning if the deterioration continues.\nThe worsening water quality, related to faecal pollution, has happened despite assurances from Southern Water that they are taking action.

Also sent to Dover Express.\nTotalitarian one-party states are regimes where those in power control the state broadcaster and public discourse. In functional democracies, a party with temporary political power does not control a publicly owned state broadcaster by making party political appointments. In a functional democracy, a publicly owned organisation does not prevent public figures from commenting in moderate language on public issues. As a law-abiding citizen, it sends a chill down my spine when I hear a Prime Minister and other ministers, in my country, in the 21st century, using inflammatory language attacking lawyers (lefty or righty or supportive of international laws on human rights). Any politician using language to incite law-breaking, (by attacking and dehumanizing lawyers or asylum seekers or voluntary services or anyone) lays themselves open to prosecution, and they should also be judged in the ballot-box.\nAs recently as Sept 2020, there was a violent attack on a lawyer after a previous Conservative Home Secretary shouted about lawyers in the media. There is a foreseeable risk when language is used to divide and attack the rule of law.\nOn 12 Oct 2020 the chair of the Bar council in the Law Gazette said, “‘There should never be a situation when a British prime minister, home secretary and other government ministers need to be called upon to stop deliberately inflammatory language towards a profession simply doing its job in the public interest. Shockingly, we’ve arrived at that point.”\nHowever worried about electoral losses a party may be, it should never stoop to using scare tactics prevalent 90 years ago, in the 1930s. The UK led when many countries, in 1951, signed up to the Refugee Convention, when many had recent memories of why human rights need to be enshrined in international law. Armed service members of my family, often told me of their experiences 80 years ago, in the 1940s, in a Europe full of displaced persons. They spent decades picking up the pieces after arrogant, monied, politicians postured, and would feel so betrayed today by the behaviour of Conservative government ministers.\nSarah Waite-Gleave",

It an intrinsic and essential means of building back better and fairer post-covid to resolve East Kent’s worsening social injustices. As such, it is eminently worth serious investment, councils should not ignore their capacity to borrow especially when interest rates are so low, and the investment in infra structure and jobs will pay dividends for the local economy and the climate.\nWe thank DDC most sincerely for inviting Green Party Nominee to work with the CCWG in Nov 2019. We have done our very best to contribute constructively at all the 6 meetings, and used all the opportunities to feedback to officers + Cabinet with specifics. (DDC is blessed with remarkably able officers in this area, who we heartily applaud). We have put the case for strong, locally appropriate, climate action on all occasions provided, and have been delighted to hear, in CCWG meetings, the points of view of Climate Justice, The Woodland Trust, The Kent Low Emissions Strategy, Bureau Veritas (on air pollution issues), and Community Energy South, on solar electricity to feed the rail service.\nThe scale of the problem of poor unhealthy housing in aging towns, is described in https://theconversation.com/the-uk-has-some-of-the-least-energy-efficient-housing-in-europe-heres-how-to-fix-this-151609\nWe would argue both for retro-fitting to a higher standard than EPC band C, and for regulation to make builders, build social housing to zero carbon standards.\nPromises on environmental enhancement (10- 13%), if not backed up by regulations insisting on independent, honest, robust, before-and-after measurements conducted on the ground will contribute to a furthering of the rapidly dissolving trust in local and central government. National bodies (e.g. Wildlife Trusts) who’ve worked with government on the emerging Environment Bill, are categorical on this subject. We have suggested that all developments of over 15 dwellings should need mandatory EIA (Environmental Impact Assessments.) We have put the case for recruitment of more planning enforcement officers of 2 sorts, to work on a) environmental, biodiversity, tree retention and planting promises, and to work on b) promises of low / zero carbon building. Cheap, google-map reports submitted by big developers (the pipers who call the tune) are rightly distrusted by the public.\nFriends of the Earth, LGA, Centre for Sustainable Energy with T&CPA, and Zero Carbon Britain all put the case for participatory democratic on-going mechanisms being needed so that communities, at ward and village level, and citizens, can be empowered to amend and enhance Local Action Plans for carbon reduction. These national groups say top-down imposition of rapid change won’t resolve the existential crisis by 2030 / 2050. A new independent local climate and ecological forum of various community and campaign groups across the district is being formed and a request has been tabled for full council (27th Jan) asking DDC to accept a brief report from this forum on a quarterly basis, each report to feedback to council on effectiveness of DDC’s Climate Change strategy + Action plan.",

A better plan would diversify and redirect freight across the southeast using more ports, and by using RAIL links.\nBig new roads and developments are just starting along A2 near Whitfield – If they want to put more freight on A2 it would need a fly-over or under at Duke of York’s roundabout for local traffic.\nThe planned lorry park at Stanford will prevent much-needed sustainable, radical solutions being put in place.

There have been prolonged shortages of rainfall in historic times, notably 1890-1909, 1990-1992 and more recently 1995-1997.\nThe drought in 1995 triggered many drought mitigation, planning and infrastructure reactions prompted by the adverse economic effects. The Environment Agency has described the Dover and Folkestone regions as “Exceptionally Low” with regards to rainfall.\nThe overall effects, however, are not just economic but more wide-ranging:\n- Livestock, such as sheep, pigs and cows, become short of fresh grass to graze resulting in poorer condition and growth and a reliance on winter hay (which may be in short supply).\n- Grains and other crops may not swell to full size and the crop may be poor quality and low yield. These food supply difficulties ultimately contribute to the rise in the cost of living.\n- The danger of fire and subsequent destruction of land and property has reached the UK after many years of trauma across the globe in places like the USA, Australia, Europe and Africa.\n- With the failure of crops and livestock there can be many ongoing indirect effects such as fewer jobs.\n- Water restrictions by our Water Companies can be drastic and much more severe than a simple hose-pipe ban.\n- Water quality – never very good to start with and very much a current issue – is compromised which can be a serious health hazard. This is potentially something that our Dover District Council can do something about.\n- Wetlands, Rivers, lakes and ponds run dry with a subsequent loss of biodiversity.\n- Trees are weakened and some may not recover while wildfires can destroy valuable timber.\n- Water based activities and boat transport can suffer.\n- recover such as increased stress on endangered species or even extinction.\n- Wind erosion and reduced soil quality.\n- There can be many social impacts of drought including public safety, health, conflict, and changes in lifestyle.\n- Across the globe many people are losing their lives and livelihoods due to drought as well as devastating floods. The Climate Crisis is overtaking us. Melting ice is raising water levels and many people’s homes are already under water. Climate migration requires relocation and we may be facing increased numbers of refugees.\nWe need a plan. Poor water quality is a consequence of many factors including drought conditions and affects us all. The Green Party proposes the following action for our Council to protect our water quality-\nThis Council notes:\nResidents are deeply concerned about water quality and the impact of regular wastewater discharge, which includes untreated sewage, into our local rivers and seas and the impact on wildlife and on human health. The UK has the dirtiest rivers in Europe. Releasing sewage into rivers is no longer an emergency-only situation occurring as a result of severe storms, but an everyday occurrence even in ‘normal’ rainfall, and that we are in a situation of cumulative overload on the sewage and wastewater system.\nWhilst there are long term commitments, there are no plans in place which will address the immediate unacceptable situation either locally by Southern Water or by national government.\nBoth the local Dover District Council and national planning policy requires a robust approach to both water quality and pollution and a recent legal opinion from the Environmental Law Firm confirms the need to consider cumulative impact. Yet planning consultation documents show that it has not been the practice of council planners to ask Water Companies to report on cumulative impact i.e. whether or not development may lead to any potential increase in ’emergency’ discharge into rivers and seas.\nThis Council resolves to:\n- Recognise this Council’s obligation to protect its rivers and seas, including from the cumulative impacts of pollution, in line with its local planning policy and the National Planning Policy Framework.\n- Recognise that there is clear evidence of deterioration of water quality due to cumulative impact of multiple sewage discharge events or ‘sewage overload’.\n- Ensure that an evidence base is compiled that assesses the cumulative impact of sewage discharge so that this is factored into decisions made in new iterations of the local plan, including the overall level of future development.\n- Seek to better understand the cumulative impact of wastewater discharge including untreated sewage on our local rivers, wildlife and the health of our residents.\n- Continue to take a lead on addressing this issue, working constructively with other agencies.\n- Ask the chair of the relevant scrutiny committee to invite the Chief Executive of Southern Water plus senior representatives from the Environment Agency and Natural England to attend a meeting to answer questions on the current levels of sewage discharge.\n- Ask Southern Water from this date onwards, in its planning consultation responses for major development, to clarify which treatment works will be managing the sewage; whether it has the information available to assess the impact on the number or duration of sewage discharges into local rivers or seas, and if it does have this information to share it.\n- Request that planning officers, from now onwards, include in all reports relating to major development a specific section on the impact on watercourses, including the potential for the development to affect sewage outflow into watercourses (i.e. cumulative impact), or to flag if this information is not fully available, so that this information (or the lack of it) is clearly and transparently set out.\nby Peter Findley, Dover & Deal Green Party",

  "https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk/https_doveranddeal_greenparty_org_uk_trees-and-yet-more-trees/content_114.html": "by Cllr Mike Eddy, Deal Town Council\nYou know that the messages about the need for more trees must be getting through, when the Saturday Guardian (16 April 2022) has 2 pages on “the life-changing magic of planting trees” in its Lifestyle section. And in the list of 5 things you can do to help, they suggest lobbying your local council for more trees and keeping an eye open for greenwashing by questioning the types of species and their future safeguarding.\nOn the front cover of the May/June edition of British Archaeology (published by the Council for British Archaeology), the headline is “A message from the Neolithic – Don’t Plant Trees”. But rather than not planting trees, the real message from the Neolithic is let nature do the planting by managing our existing woodland. Mature coppiced and pollarded trees provide richer habitats for other flora and fauna than fields of saplings. Managed woodlands also soak up more carbon and provide jobs, while the coppiced poles can be turned in to a variety of useful items.\nAnd the New Scientist for 16 April devotes several pages to a plan to set aside 30% of the planet’s land and sea area for nature by 2030. “30 by 30”, as the plan is called, will be a tough ask but 30% is regarded as the bare minimum to allow healthy biodiversity to be maintained.",

Three rallies were organised, one each in Deal, Dover and Sandwich for Bonfire night, Friday 5th November.\nIn Deal around 50 people turned out at Deal Station. Poems were read, there was a ‘die-in’ and a pop-up performance by the synchronised Green Barrows troup of clean-up pilots.\nSarah Gleave, Dover and Deal Green Party, said “We’ve seen bonfires of forest fires, and floods, worldwide, caused by climate crisis; Chatham House risk assessment of Sept 2021 shows we are on course to miss the 1.5 degrees of warming because a lack of international cooperation has us on course for 2.7 degrees. We’ve seen the predicted coastal changes this would bring to our Kent doorsteps. We were delighted to renew friendships and to make new contacts so that we can work to persuade DDC to do much much more to protect our woodland, wetland grassland carbon sinks and our food-producing fields.”\nLiz Hayes of Transition Town Dover said, “In Pencester we met many climate-concerned resident, friends old and new. Using songs and banners and we shared our determination to call for climate justice; We say, NO COP26, cop-out. We are doing what we can as individuals, but we need those with economic and government power to take much more real, honest action. DDC should bring forward the target date for a zero carbon whole district; 2050 is decades too late.”\nSimon Dundas of Sandwich Environmental Conservation Group, “At Sandwich station we met many people of all backgrounds who really want to make a difference. Halving rail fares could make a dramatic reduction to Kent’s carbon footprint. More people at last are waking up to the critical tipping points we are reaching. This is affecting millions across the world and thousands here in Kent also where we’ve seen the maps of all the areas that will be underwater by 2050 if serious action isn’t taken by the powerful.”\nSharon Danby of East Kent Climate Action and Green Barrows said, “A real, honest, just transition would create well-paid jobs making homes, old and new, zero-carbon and cosy, lifting millions out of fuel-poverty. It would create jobs in community-owned renewables, in local, healthy food production and in better, cheaper public transport.”\nFamily-friendly events were also held in other towns across Kent, in Chatham, Faversham, Canterbury, Sevenoaks, Folkestone and elsewhere, coordinated by Kent Climate Action Coalition (linked to COP26 Coalition).\nNationally, COP26 Coalition Climate Justice March in London on Sat 6th brought out many from across Kent including a number of our members and supporters, and a couple managed to get to Glasgow too. These demonstrations included youth, faith, trade union, environmental and many other groups. A coach was paid for by Unite Community Kent and Medway Unison used by demonstrators from Ramsgate, Dover, Canterbury and Rochester who returned home on Saturday uplifted and with renewed determination to pester the powerful to protect Kent’s coast line from rising sea levels.\nKent Climate Action Coalition was born 31 Aug 2021.\nWebsite : kentclimateactioncoalition.org.ukEmail: info@kentclimateactioncoalition.org.uk\nFacebook: facebook.com/Kent-Climate-Action-Coalition-105091551956693,\nTwitter: @kent_coalition\nInstagram: instagram.com/kentclimateactioncoalition.\nNational COP26 Coalition : https://cop26coalition.org/",

Just email deputyclerk@walmercouncil.co.uk with your name and address in Walmer.\nA limited number will be available to Walmer residents ready for Spring planting. The Beebombs will come with advice for planting to ensure success.\nOrder now to make sure you get one – one per household. Walmer Town Council will let you know in the Spring when it’s ready to collect.\nWhy this matters\nBritish bees love to feast on a wide range of native wildflower species, and our gardens are important habitats for them. As bee populations are in decline we want to do our bit to help reverse that and help our important pollinators thrive again.\nThis is a Walmer Town Council, Climate Emergency Working Group, initiative and is part of their drive to help mitigate the effects of climate change in our community.\nWhy BeeBombs and what are they?\n97% of natural bee and butterfly habitat has been lost in the UK since WW2. 97%. Ninety seven percent. It’s frightening and critical.\nWith your help, we can start to restore the lost wildflower habitat and make an important contribution to the biodiversity of Walmer and Great Britain\nHand made in Dorset, Beebombs (https://www.beebombs.com) are a mix of 18 British wildflower seeds, fine, sifted soil and locally sourced clay. The seeds are native species and designated by the Royal Horticultural Society as “Perfect for Pollinators”. Walmer in Bloom member Mr Richard Oram, a local lepidopterist, has looked into the composition of BeeBombs and feels they are a suitable mix to be used in this area without causing an unnatural imbalance in the local fauna. This is important as a sudden change can cause a shock to the insect population.\nBeebombs just need to be scattered onto cleared ground to create a wildflower meadow that will #bringthebeesback\nIn terms of coverage, one pack of Beebombs, covers 21 square foot or 2 square metres.\nBee Bombs can be scattered throughout the year, the clay protects them until they are ready to germinate, though many say spring and autumn are particularly good times to start them growing. Around 20% will start flowering in the first year. Biennials and Perennials in the mix will start blossoming in the 2nd year.\nBeeBombs come with no plastic packaging. They are 100% sustainable and recyclable. BeeBombs are sold individually at £7.99 each, but Walmer Town Council will supply them to Walmer residents for FREE.",

Right now government Department for Transport, are saying it is a temporary site with a 5 year requirement but this will just open the doors to the site being developed later. It won’t revert to farmland and fields. Once it is built on there is no going back.\nLorries will be driving to and from the site 24/7, it will impact local people’s quality of life enormously. Air, noise and light pollution both from the IBF and from the lorry queues on A2 under Guston, not to mention the loss of amenity, will negatively affect their health and well-being. The same things will affect biodiversity; light pollution has devastating impacts on birds and animals.\nLocal people have been kept in the dark and the swiftly arranged ‘engagement (non-consultation)’ period is woefully inadequate. This situation has been foreseeable for years and a better solution must be found. The whole of the locality will be affected by the knock-on traffic issues on A2 if this IBF goes ahead, here. The volume of traffic on minor roads through villages and hamlets will increase dramatically, as we always see when there are lorry hold-ups. This all adds up to massive safety issues with this site.\nLast week, DfT said HGVs will use the Dover Fast-track route as part of IBF plans. But the Dover Fast-track was intended to provide greener, cleaner bus and cycle travel and was consulted on; It was part of KCC / DCC economic regeneration plans.

They pretend they’re not rapidly privatising our NHS.\nYes, it is irresponsible to pretend that 250 acres can solve the mayhem for Dover of Britain leaving the customs union in 2019.\nCan those of us in the majority, who long for a much more responsible government, and a much more accountable Westminster, find a way to work together? Towards some real ‘One nation’, progressive policies? So that the next generation may inherit a fairer Britain, respected by its allies once again?\nWe should look into the influence of Big Oil and Putin on our policy-makers, like the US senate has been doing.
