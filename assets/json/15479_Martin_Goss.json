This is despite a Conservatives manifesto commitment to keep the triple lock in place until 2024 and comes just weeks after Boris Johnson led his Conservative MPs to vote for a promise breaking tax hike on National Insurance. The Liberal Democrats have warned that the Conservatives are “turning their back on local elderly residents,” many of whom are living in poverty.\nThe figures, based on analysis by the House of Commons Library commissioned by the Liberal Democrats, show that 13.1% of people in Colchester will be hit by the government’s broken promise. They also show that 2002 pensioners in the area are benefiting from state Pension Credit, which is given to the poorest pensioners.\nThe Liberal Democrats tabled an amendment in Parliament to the Social Security Bill that called for additional support to address the impact of the pandemic on the two million pensioners currently living in poverty and making the uplift to Universal Credit permanent. Labour abstained on the vote, making the Liberal Democrats the only major UK-wide party to stand up for pensioners and oppose the government’s broken promise to them.\nCommenting, Martin Goss, Lib Dem Parliamentary Spokesperson for Colchester said:\n“This is yet another broken promise from the Conservatives that will hit pensioners in Colchester hard in the pocket.\n“The government is turning its back on local elderly residents, who risk no longer being able to heat their homes this winter as energy costs spiral.\n“Our pensioners deserve a fair deal. The triple lock was a cast iron guarantee that vulnerable elderly people were relying on and the Conservatives have failed them.\n“Liberal Democrats are demanding that the government supports the many pensioners in our area living in poverty and ensure that we don’t return to the days of the 75p rise to the state pension”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

However, the plans also say Boris Johnson will not seek any extension despite overwhelming evidence showing that time-frame is near impossible.\nThis means that the Tories are signing up to crash the UK out of the EU without a deal, the Liberal Democrats claim.\nThis is why Martin Goss has today written to Will Quince, the Conservative candidate for Colchester, to ask them to rule out a no-deal Brexit in December 2020 which would cause severe economic damage and put jobs at risk in Colchester.\nCommenting on the announcement, Liberal Democrat Candidate for Colchester Martin Goss, said:\n“It is clear that the Conservatives are now effectively the party of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. They are content to see the UK crash out of the EU without a deal.\n“Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan is already a disaster for people in Colchester but he has now made things even worse by putting the UK on a collision course with a no-deal Brexit in December 2020. That means more harm to our NHS, more uncertainty for businesses, more jobs lost.\n“People in Colchester have a right to know whether Will Quince supports the reckless and dangerous plan Boris Johnson is proposing. That is why I have written to Will Quinceto urge them to rule out supporting any deal that risks a no deal cliff edge in December 2020.\n“The Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to stop Brexit. We are the strongest party for Remainers and we know that there is no deal as good as the one we have in the EU.”\n1 Comment\nHi Martin. I am a resident of Prior Way Colchester. Now that the government has eased lock down, will you please arrange for the cones/barriers be removed from Colne Bank Avenue and North Station Road. The barriers on Colne Bank Avenue are causing long tailbacks of traffic into the Westway roundabout and Cymbeline Way.\nMany thanks.\nRoy Golledge",

Heating and water\nTurn the water temperature or heating down a bit, over time this will save you more than you realise. The timings of the heating and water over each day can equally impact the size of the bills you receive. For example, turning the hot water off just before having a bath will prevent the system from reheating a tankful of water.\nPeople are also heat-creating machines – we turn food into heat. If you’re cold sitting down, then consider moving around and going up and down the stairs a couple of times. There’s the added benefit of getting a bit of exercise!\n2. Windows, curtains and blinds\nJust as double-glazing works to keep heat in and cold out, your blinds and curtains can also help. Even if you have double or triple glazing in your home and they are draught-proofed you can still lose heat through your windows. If the sun is warm in the daytime, you can benefit from the heat by keeping curtains open, and then at night-time. close them to keep the heat in.\n3. Call the supplier and check you’re on the right tariff\nIf you live on your own or are on a low income, you may be on the wrong tariff. Call your provider and ask them if there is a better one. Alternatively, check with uswitch.com and see if there is a cheaper provider.\n4. Does your supplier offer smart meters?\nThese meters can be installed by some providers for free and will allow you to see how much energy you’re using which allows you to check which devices use the most energy. Seeing the minute-by-minute and day-by-day costs will help avoid waste and the anxiety of not knowing what the bill will be.\n5. Most modern devices use very little energy on standby and some, such as routers and set-top boxes like satellite receivers may fail if regularly switched off. A smart meter will allow you to see how much power they use. Switch a device off and see how much the reading falls.\n6. Reduce the use of hot things\nHeating requires a great deal of energy. If the unit cost of electricity reaches 50p per KWh, a tumble dryer load could cost £2.50. Similarly, consider just how often clothes need to be washed and use a full load rather than two half loads.. Using an oven for ten minutes to warm places could cost 50p each time. Turning off the radiator in an unused room and closing the door is another obvious way to save energy.\n7. Think more circular – what can be re-used?\nAs an example, instead of boiling a kettle for gravy, consider using the hot water from the vegetables – it adds more flavour too! If you have a wood burner, look for people in your local community who are trying to offload wood from projects. Facebook marketplace can be good for this. These are just a couple of examples!\n8. Consider using the microwave more\nMicrowaves heat things up more efficiently than the oven saving energy. One way of leveraging this may be to batch cook meals such as spaghetti bolognaise (with friends maybe) and then the resulting extras can be stored and ‘pinged’ in the microwave in minutes. Heating a mug of water in a microwave could be a third of the cost of boiling water to the minimum fill line in a kettle.\n9. Efficient LED bulbs\nModern LED light bulbs start instantly, produce a good light, have a long life and can cost as little as a pound each. If the light in a room you use a lot is not a low-energy one, replace that one first.\n10. Invest in smart tech products\nLast on the list are smart tech products, such as Zado or Hive, which can help you manage your heating and hot water more efficiently. If you cannot afford the initial outlay of these, regularly monitoring a smart meter and changing the times on the heating system manually will achieve much the same result. Now might be a good time to invest. Don’t forget to employ a local tradesman to help your local community!\nLeave a Reply",

There will also be changes to the rear access road to the park to allow for a set of drive-through lanes to be created.

The shortfall, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, has meant that Councillors of all parties are having to consider how to fill this significant gap and minimise the impact on residents.\nOn Tuesday the Council’s Scrutiny Panel made a proposal to defer this paper to a Task and Finish Group to fully investigate the proposed green waste collection service and wider use of wheelie bins. Tonight, the Cabinet unanimously supported this recommendation. No measures will be put in place until this group have delivered their recommendations as to its viability to Cabinet and then to Full Council.\nSpeaking on Wednesday night Councillor Goss told Cabinet:\n“We are listening generally. We cannot just say we do not like that. You need to come up with answers that you do like and will serve the budget issues.”\nAfter the meeting Councillor Goss said:\n“We are all disappointed at government failure to provide on its commitment to financially support local authorities and avoid additional charges, possible redundancies and cuts in services.\n“I am delighted that there is an opportunity for councillors from all parties to now be able to properly scrutinise the green waste collection and use of wheelie bins. It is important that residents are heard so that priorities of services and cuts during these difficult times are responsive to their wishes.”\n1 Comment\nDear mr Goss\nI live at no. 10 Littlecotes Mile End Colchester.\nWe have 10 houses in the road, some of us have purchased an extra garden waste bin which we bought from the council.\nThe waste collectors are taking only one bin. I rung and made a complaint, I was told, the council rule’s , there’s more garden rubbish in the winter but not in the summer, I personally think there’s more garden rubbish in the summer and a lot less in the winter.\nThe collectors are so rude and they don’t care how to talk to people.\nCan you please try and sort this problem out and all the neighbours are very disappointed with the council and all of us are aware that one of your responsibilities is waste collection.\nPlease try and put the situation right.\nHope to hear from you soon.\nThank you\nR valaydon",

Some people may have abused the system but on the whole it worked well.\n“What it became was three pay bands, so if you did one filling you ended up being paid the same amount as if you had 20 fillings. What that then meant was that you had practices being scared to take on new patients as they might bring a whole heap of problems.\n“I worked under this system for many years but what happened is they never increased my banding, my money. Effectively it meant we were being paid what we were 10 years ago and you are starting to make more of a loss.\n“People need access to dentists, especially those in severe pain and emergencies because that is tying up A&E’s time, out-of-hours doctors’’ time as one area of the service has a big impact on the whole healthcare service.”\nDr Pitt was hosting a visit by Martin Goss, the Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for Colchester, and Amalia Rowe Head of Oral Health Science at Essex University to acknowledge a work placement partnership scheme.\nMartin said: “Regrettably, like so many dentists, Stephen has had to come out of the NHS.

Hopefully that may attract more dentists back but my worry is the system has gone too far and will take many years to get dentists back on the books.\n“This is also happening with pharmacies, where the NHS is doing the same and why many are closing because they are actually losing money of dispensing various prescriptions.\nEssex University has one of the largest portfolios of oral health science courses in the East of England and many of its students gain valuable experience thanks to the link-up with dental practices in the Colchester area.\nIn all, the University has 30-40 placements at different practices, many in this region and Mrs Rowe said: “What is fantastic is the partnerships we create and I think what the students get out of it is that real world experience and engaging with the community and patients and their real-life experiences.”\nDr Pitt said: “This partnership helps the students treat a broad range of people not just the specialist cases referred to a hospital. It means they are basically seeing what they will do when they are qualified.\n“From our perspective this helps, because the more time the students get in practice helps our patients to be re-educated on how to prevent problems. The great thing about this partnership is we are able to give a lot of information to our patients on a regular basis to reinforce the causes of dental issues and help prevent bigger problems happening.”\nDr Pitt also pointed to the increasing need for more dentists following the Covid pandemic and added: “The cost of living isn’t just affecting the way they live, it also affects their teeth, with people suffering from stress tending to clench, which puts 10 times more pressure on your teeth\n“We are seeing more breakages of teeth or teeth just wearing down so we need a process of monitoring that more closely.”\nSee the full interview at: https://youtu.be/xBDn5mVg18g?si=FQ0wjhfK2j2xKcmY\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The vouchers could be spent on a range of activities including tutoring in reading, writing and maths, music lessons, swimming classes or other physical education.\nThe programme would last three years, with one £200 Catch-Up Voucher provided annually for every school child in the country, in what the Liberal Democrats said would become “the world’s biggest ever parent-listening exercise.”\n5310 children on free school meals in Colchester would be eligible for Catch-Up vouchers worth £400 a year under the proposals. This would help close the learning gap for disadvantaged children who were less likely to have the resources they needed to learn at home during the pandemic. Pupils with special educational needs who are also eligible for Free School Meals would be provided with triple vouchers worth £600 a year.\nThe ambitious plans were featured this week on BBC One and ITV as part of the Liberal Democrats’ Party Political Broadcast. They would form part of a £15 billion package of education catch-up funding, or £500 per child, as recommended by the Government’s former Education Recovery Commissioner Sir Kevan Collins. This is ten times more than the £50 per child being provided under the government’s current plans.\nCommenting on the new scheme, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Spokerperson for Colchester Martin Goss said:\n“Children have already suffered too much during this pandemic, from not seeing their friends to missing out on school. We need to see a massive investment in helping kids catch up on this lost learning, instead of the pitiful £50 per child the government is currently offering.\n“The Liberal Democrats’ Catch-up Voucher scheme would put money directly into the hands of parents in Colchester to spend on whatever their children need most. It would also provide extra cash for the families of disadvantaged children and those with special needs, to help them close the learning gap.”\nLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey MP added:\n“The Liberal Democrats are the party of empowering people, and supporting parents and children is our top priority in the new fair deal we are offering.\n“Covid should mark a watershed in how we educate our children and young people. It is clearer than ever that we need a massive education catch-up fund. And this catch-up fund – which our schools desperately need – should also give parents a radical new role in their children’s education.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The latest figures reveal that across the country only 39,474 homes have been helped under the scheme, including 22,000 low-income households.\nApplications made before March 2021 are still being processed, but most have now been finalised. There was also no replacement scheme announced at last week’s Budget, meaning homeowners are being left with no direct government support for green home improvements.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on the government to announce an emergency programme to insulate people’s homes, reduce energy bills and cut the UK’s carbon emissions. It comes as world leaders meet in Glasgow this week at the COP summit to discuss global climate targets.\nMartin Goss, Liberal Democrat Spokesperson for Colchester said:\n“It is shocking that so few homes in Colchester have been helped to insulate their homes through the Green Homes Grant scheme.\n“This initiative was launched to much fanfare and was meant to help thousands of people make energy efficiency improvements to their homes. Instead, families are being abandoned ahead of the cold winter months at a time energy bills are soaring.\n“The Government must show the UK is a global leader in tackling climate change by launching an emergency programme to insulate our homes, reduce emissions and slash heating bills.\n“We need to end fuel poverty and make sure that families in Colchester aren’t forced to choose between heating and eating.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Bring in a programme of awareness amongst schoolchildren.\nAs the motion relates to a non-executive matter it will be debated and determined at the meeting\nMartin Goss said:\n“I have been extremely concerned for some while by the increase in use and the manner in which these vapes are promoted, particularly concerning young people, particularly while any potential long term health risk is unknown.\n“The chemicals within vapes are dangerous when these are not properly disposed of particularly to our environment and wildlife as well as incidents of bin lorries and recycling facilities catching fire.”\nBACKGROUND\nMartin is not alone in calling for urgent legislation to tackle the out-of-control vaping industry. According to the organisation behind the Recycle Your Electricals campaign, Material Focus, last year around 1.3m single-use vapes were thrown away each week in this country.\nAccording to a Sky Investigation[i] primary schoolchildren are becoming ill due to smoking vapes with 15 children admitted to hospital last year up to April this year. This is alarming due to the toxicity and addictive nature of chemicals within vapes.\nMartin added:\n“I hope my Motion with the backing of all the political parties in Colchester, will help put pressure on this government to take urgent action and prevent further risk to health and to our environment.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The relaxation was made by the last Government.\n“I am not opposed to the principle of empty office blocks being converted into housing,” explained Councillor Goss. “What I am saying is that they should be subject to planning consent. This is not only fair on those who will be living in the flats, but also the community in which such office block conversions are located.”\nCouncillor Goss made his comment after concerns were raised that the former offices at Seatrade House are almost in the playground of North Primary School which it is in front of – and the flats will overlook the day nursery just a few feet away.\nThe main pedestrian entrance to the School is a passageway built as part of the office block as a requirement of the planning consent when the office block was built more than 40 years ago.\nCouncillor Goss said: “I understand that Essex County Council had been alerted to buying Seatrade House because the building would have made welcome additional space for the school and the car park would have significantly eased parking pressures which the School has.\n“Unfortunately, such is the high value for properties that can be converted to residential use without the need for change of planning use, what would have been a much welcome addition for the benefit of the School meant that the price was way above the value of the building as an office block or for educational use.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We will continue the pressure so the Government does the right thing.\nThe speech is outlined below:\n“I am pleased and honoured to have been asked to open this rally on behalf of 3.8 million fellow citizens who have been unfairly refused furlough.\nI have been in regional politics for 13 years and I would like to state very clearly that this is not party political. One of the many reasons I entered politics was to enter a fairer society where as many people as possible are included and not excluded and where as many as possible are all treated equitably.\nThe matter that we are all here to talk about today is the exact opposite that I believe in. As a Lib Dem, fairness is for all.\nI first became aware of this issue in the first stages of the lockdown where Rishi Sunak stated very clearly on a number of occasions that no- one would be left behind. I’ve watched, read, listened and learned over the following months with it being abundantly clear to me that Rishi Sunak, the Treasury and this Government have not stuck to their word.\nThe number of my fellow citizens who have been excluded and affected grows daily, with continuing confusion and conflation over lockdown messaging, this matter is now a matter at crisis point. Every single day people are suffering.\nCompany Directors, people wrongly refused furlough who are pay-as-you-earn employees, marginalised minority groups and those who fall through the cracks continue to suffer. People have taken their own lives as they have received no support whatsoever. The Excluded Unity Alliance is going to change this.\nThis cross party group who have come together on a non-political basis will be the vehicle that engenders the change that is so desperately and urgently needed. After me I am pleased to see that cross party colleagues from Labour, SNP, Green Plaid Cymru, DUP and fellow Lib Dems have come together as a voice of unity, as a voice of common sense against a burning sense of injustice.\nAccording to the Centre Think tank there are 16,000 people affected in my area of North Essex so this is an issue personal to me, my family, colleagues and friends. Nearly everyone knows someone who has fallen through the cracks and yet the Government has refused steadfastly to do anything about it. This isn’t acceptable and needs to change.\nI don’t want anyone listening to think that this is just a national issue, it is very much a regional and local issue which is important to local politicians like myself. We will move mountains, knock down doors and get everyone who has been refused a fair deal.\nWe all know what it is like to lose a loved one. I lost my mum three years ago to this day and we must spare a thought to all those who have lost close and dear family or friends through the pandemic and also where sadly the denial of help from this Government has seen people take their own lives.\nIf Rishi Sunak made a mistake when creating the scheme, why has he doubled down for 18 months, rather than accepting the error and making fair and proportional change. This appears to be the Government’s way.\nYou will hear speaking this afternoon the very real and deeply personal stories of three people refused furlough. They are supported by cross Party politicians– Paula Barker, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Johnathon Banks and Ian Blackford. For detailed analysis of what has gone wrong using digestible facts and figures the speech from Torrin Wilkins will be a factual eye opener for all.\nAt the end of these short speeches and endorsements there will be a questions and answer session with remaining politicians.\nI would like to thank on behalf of the Unity Alliance everyone who has played a part in this inaugural event today.

The shortfall, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, has meant that Councillors of all parties are having to consider how to fill this significant gap and minimise the impact on residents.\nOn Tuesday the Council’s Scrutiny Panel made a proposal to defer this paper to a Task and Finish Group to fully investigate the proposed green waste collection service and wider use of wheelie bins. Tonight, the Cabinet unanimously supported this recommendation. No measures will be put in place until this group have delivered their recommendations as to its viability to Cabinet and then to Full Council.\nSpeaking on Wednesday night Councillor Goss told Cabinet:\n“We are listening generally. We cannot just say we do not like that. You need to come up with answers that you do like and will serve the budget issues.”\nAfter the meeting Councillor Goss said:\n“We are all disappointed at government failure to provide on its commitment to financially support local authorities and avoid additional charges, possible redundancies and cuts in services.\n“I am delighted that there is an opportunity for councillors from all parties to now be able to properly scrutinise the green waste collection and use of wheelie bins.

This is a total loss of income of £2,815,613 between 16408 pensioners in Colchester due to the Conservative government’s decision to break a key manifesto promise and scrap the triple lock on pensions.\nAnalysis by the Liberal Democrats has shown this broken promise will wipe out the “paltry support” being offered by the government to help pensioners cope with soaring energy bills. Even those pensioners who qualify for a council tax rebate will be left over £20 poorer in real terms, while those on the New State Pension will be left short-changed by £76.20. It means retirees in Colchester are facing down a £354,413 gulf between their lost pension income and support, with that only gulf only set to widen further with the Bank of England forecasting inflation in April of 7.25%.\nColchester Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to row back on their broken promise and guarantee a fairer increase to the state pension. The party is also calling for a doubling and expansion to the Warm Home Discount, giving 17,005 households in Colchester £300 each off their heating bills this year & a doubling of the Winter Fuel Allowance, to the benefit of 16,890 households.\nLiberal Democrat Martin Goss, Parliamentary Spokersperson for Colchester, said:\n“These figures expose a black hole in the Government’s cost of living package for pensioners.\n“In breaking their manifesto promise and failing to protect the state pension, the Conservatives have plunged older people in Colchester into the depths of a cost of living crisis. Their paltry support doesn’t even begin to cover the additional costs people are facing during this cold and bitter winter.\n“Pensioners are among the most vulnerable people in Colchester. This out of touch Government has left them out in the cold, with a hole in their pocket and even harsher days ahead.\n“It’s high time the Government showed some common sense and ensured a fair increase to the state pension. But we also need to see something much more ambitious to help pensioners in Colchester. Doubling the Warm Home Discount and Winter Fuel Allowance, funded through a Robin Hood tax on the super-profits of oil and gas giants, would be a good place to start.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Local Liberal Democrats have backed the proposals which would benefit 1900 small businesses and entrepreneurs in Colchester, from cafes and restaurants to high street shops.\nThe proposed tax cut would save small businesses an average of £5,000 a year by aiding them with staff costs. It would be achieved by quadrupling the Employment Allowance to £16,000 for a period of two years. This would allow a small business to employ five people on an average salary without paying any National Insurance contributions. 1.1 million businesses would be eligible for this tax cut, which would save them an estimated £5.5 billion next year.\nIt comes as a record number of small businesses say they are struggling with rising costs whilst new Covid restrictions loom, according to a recent survey by the Federation of Small Businesses. Local restaurants have also reported a surge in Christmas bookings being canceled, setting owners back thousands of pounds.\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives have announced small businesses will have to pay more National Insurance contributions in the new year, despite facing a tough winter. Research by the House of Commons Library has shown the Conservative plans are set to hit an estimated 1500 local businesses in Colchester with a 3.9% tax bombshell.\nMartin Goss spokesperson for Colchester Liberal Democrats said:\n“Our local shops and restaurants are the backbone of our community and must be helped through a tough winter. Businesses in Colchester are struggling with mounting bills and worries about the impact of the new Covid variant in the coming weeks. We need to help them now with a big and bold offer.\n“It is disgraceful that local businesses in our area are being forced to pay even more tax by this Conservative government. We should help small businesses that have already suffered so much during the pandemic.

The Conservatives must be living on another planet if they think the answer to business owners’ problems is to put up their taxes.\n“This country was promised tax cuts by the Conservatives, but yet again their promises have been proven not to be worth the paper they are written on.\n“People and businesses need help now.

This includes people who take tests to protect their elderly relatives and friends, or vulnerable workers who work in people-facing industries such as hospitality and are concerned about their health.\nAnalysis by the Liberal Democrats estimates that the 18,076 people in Colchester who take on average two tests a week face a hit of £534 a year, assuming lateral flow tests cost around £5.80 each. This represents a total ‘tax on caring’ for people in Colchester of £9,657,155 each year.\nThese people are part of the almost four million across England facing costs of over £500 a year after the decision was taken to scrap lateral flow tests. The move will be of particular concern for the 10,125 in Colchester previously identified as clinically extremely vulnerable, after the government’s own scientific advisers on the SAGE committee warned that removing free testing will “increase anxiety” and limit the “social participation outside the home” of those who are clinically vulnerable or who live with someone who is.\nLiberal Democrat Parliamentary Spokesperson Martin Goss for Colchester said:\n“Charging people in Colchester for the tests they need to safely see vulnerable loved ones is a tax on caring, that risks leaving thousands in this area in lockdown by stealth.\n“It means vulnerable people in our community will see fewer loved ones and will be able to enjoy less of their lives.

In Colchester those pensioners receiving credit total 1,687 with 647 aged 80 plus.

It sounded tough, and MPs spoke of “sending a message” to stop people carrying knives.\nBut, as the Liberal Democrats argued at the time, it did nothing to help solve the problem of knife crime. To tackle the serious problem of knife crime, Liberal Democrats want more community police, more youth services and a new “public health” approach, not headline-grabbing pretence at action.\nSo Lib Dem MP’s voted against the new law, on the grounds that judges should have the discretion to consider all the details of the case and impose the most appropriate sentence. That might mean sending someone to prison, but judges should not be forced to do so if there’s a better option in a particular case.\nSince this bill was passed knife crime has soared. The number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales is up by 43% since 2015. Assaults with a knife are up by the same amount. And robberies using knives have increased by 67%.\nThe Government’s own analysis shows that people given community sentences are less likely to reoffend than those sentences to prison for less than a year.\nFirst, we must invest far more in our police. Unnecessary Conservative cuts mean that there are 4,800 fewer officers on the streets today than there were in 2015.\nThe Home Office’s own analysis states that this has “likely contributed” to the rise in serious violent crime, yet the Conservatives have more cuts on the way. The Liberal Democrats would halt those cuts and give forces an extra £300 million a year to recruit more officers and restore the community policing that is so important for preventing crime.\nAnd we must also change the way we think about violent crime. Scotland’s Violence Reduction Unit, established by Strathclyde Police in 2005, has pioneered a new approach that treats violent crime as a public health issue.\nAs with any disease, treatment begins by diagnosing the problem and understanding its causes. Addressing those causes requires not only the police, but also health professionals, social workers and teachers, working closely together to stop more people being infected by the disease.\nThis public health approach has proven remarkably successful. Violent crime in Scotland has halved over the past decade. In Glasgow, the number of hospital admissions for stabbings has fallen by 62%. London is now seeking to replicate that success with its own Violence Reduction Unit – something the Liberal Democrats have been advocating for years.\nThis is how the Government should be combatting the rise in serious violence: investing in the police and adopting a public health approach that tackles the root causes. Not by imposing more mandatory prison sentences that tie judges’ hands and are, in reality, just a pretence that the Government is doing something.\nMartin Goss\nProspective Parliamentary Candidate\nLeave a Reply",

The shortfall, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, has meant that Councillors of all parties are having to consider how to fill this significant gap and minimise the impact on residents.\nOn Tuesday the Council’s Scrutiny Panel made a proposal to defer this paper to a Task and Finish Group to fully investigate the proposed green waste collection service and wider use of wheelie bins. Tonight, the Cabinet unanimously supported this recommendation. No measures will be put in place until this group have delivered their recommendations as to its viability to Cabinet and then to Full Council.\nSpeaking on Wednesday night Councillor Goss told Cabinet:\n“We are listening generally. We cannot just say we do not like that. You need to come up with answers that you do like and will serve the budget issues.”\nAfter the meeting Councillor Goss said:\n“We are all disappointed at government failure to provide on its commitment to financially support local authorities and avoid additional charges, possible redundancies and cuts in services.\n“I am delighted that there is an opportunity for councillors from all parties to now be able to properly scrutinise the green waste collection and use of wheelie bins. It is important that residents are heard so that priorities of services and cuts during these difficult times are responsive to their wishes.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

But changes to the law that came into force last year mean that the Government now has the ability to force broadband providers to offer these cheaper deals.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling on the Government to offer relief to families facing a cost of living crisis, by forcing broadband providers to offer cheaper deals to vulnerable consumers in Colchester.\nResearch by the House of Commons Library suggests that 15,106 households in Colchester could see a reduction in their bills under the Liberal Democrat proposals. These households are among the seven million across the country that are currently missing out on cheaper internet access.\nMartin Goss, Liberal Democrat ParliamentarySpokesperson for Colchester, said:\n“Some of the most vulnerable consumers in Colchester are bracing themselves for a cost of living crisis, with energy bills soaring through the roof, a slash to Universal Credit and unfair Tory tax hikes leaving everyone feeling the squeeze.\n“A reduction in broadband bills could be the breathing space families in Colchester need this winter. Instead, this Conservative Government is instead choosing to sit on its hands and leave thousands here paying over the odds.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Jamie Stone MP, said:\n“Access to broadband is vital for learning, for work, and for staying connected. The Liberal Democrats think the very least the Government can do is offer the lifeline of social tariffs to anyone who needs it.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Of these, the majority of bed days lost involved patients who had been stuck in hospital for three weeks or more.\nDelayed discharges take place when medically fit patients are unable to leave hospital, often due to a lack of social care. Across the country, the NHS lost over 128,800 bed days to delayed discharges from hospital, up 32% on the same period last year.\nThe Liberal Democrats warned that the government’s failure to tackle the social care crisis was having a “disastrous” impact on local NHS services, piling pressure on hospitals while elderly and vulnerable patients are left waiting for the care they need. The party is calling for the introduction of a Carer’s Minimum Wage, set at £2 above the minimum wage, to help address the huge number of job vacancies in social care.\nLiberal Democrat Martin Goss for Colchester said:\n“These worrying figures show the disastrous impact the social care crisis is having on our local health services.\n“Far too many elderly and vulnerable people are ending up stuck in hospital when they are ready to leave, because there simply isn’t the care available for them at home or in the community.\n“This is causing unneeded pain and distress while piling even more pressure on our already overstretched hospitals,\n“The Liberal Democrats know that you can’t fix the crisis in the NHS without fixing the crisis in social care.

The NHS target is for 93% of patients to be seen within this time but across England, nearly a quarter of people don’t see a consultant for that urgent appointment.\nThe data shows Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust as one of the worst waiting times in the country for cancer waiting times, with only just over half of people seeing a specialist within 28 days of referral by the GP, while nearby Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust nearly 9 in 10 of people do. Similarly, Birmingham Women’s And Children’s NHS Foundation Trust sees 89% of people in 28 days but down the road at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust only 55% are.\nAhead of the local elections, the Liberal Democrats are calling for the Government to hire more staff, especially specialist cancer nurses. The party is also calling for a comprehensive strategy to ensure all those who have been left behind are offered timely cancer diagnosis and treatment and that targets be met as soon as possible.\nCommenting on cancer waiting times in Colchester, Liberal Democrat Martin Goss, said:\n“The Government has been driving our local health services into the ground and taking patients for granted for years, Colchester deserves better. My mum died from cancer so this issue couldn’t be closer to my heart or of utmost importance!\n“Delays to cancer diagnoses and treatments are incredibly distressing for those with cancer and those who fear they may have it.\n“This Conservative Government has its head in the sand over staff shortages and no real plan to fix it, there must be action to fix this horrific crisis.\n“They must get a handle on this crisis so cancer patients get the urgent care they need to give them the best chance of survival and recovery.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This follows an announcement that the Government has pulled the vote on Monday (7th) for their planned vote in Parliament to widen implementation of Universal Credit.\nMartin said: “Mr Quince has repeatedly voted for measures that have cut benefits where it is most needed. These includes those who are in supported housing, disabled residents as well as the chronically ill.\n“It is little wonder that Colchester has such levels of poverty, particularly for children growing up in Colchester. Our Food Bank has experienced record requests for help by families and children so that they could eat this Christmas. Under Mr Quince’s Government, child poverty is predicted to rise by 7% from 2015 to 2022 and in Colchester, a quarter of our children are now living in poverty. This is totally unacceptable. Urgent action is needed.”\nMartin’s comments come following a result of the recent report by Professor Philip Alston, United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights who observed that:\n“For almost one in every two children to be poor in twenty-first century Britain is not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster, all rolled into one.”\nProfessor Philip Alston further commented in his report:\n“Universal Credit is being implemented in ways that negatively impact many claimants’ mental health, finances, and work prospects.”\nMartin Goss said: “The report is a damning indictment of this Conservative Government who have taken away the support and real help that families and vulnerable people need when their circumstances take a change for the worse. Homelessness, poverty, crime, drug use, have all increased to alarming levels in Colchester.

But under Lib Dem plans an additional 26,732 children in the county from Year 3 and above would be included.\nThe party will fund their manifesto policy by introducing a share buyback tax, inspired by a similar tax introduced by President Joe Biden in the USA.\nMartin said: “In our area there are too many children expected to learn on empty stomachs with no guarantee of a hot meal when they get home.\n“Conservative MPs should hang their heads in shame at a legacy of children going hungry in the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.”\nIn all, there are some 90,000 children deemed living in poverty in the East of England who not receive free school meals. Analysis by leading finance company PWC found that every £1 spent on free school meals for the poorest children generates £1.38 in health and earnings benefits, including improvements to health, education and future working life opportunities.\nThe Government currently only provides meals for all children in reception, Year 1 and Year 2. In Year 3 and above there are stringent conditions for children receiving free school meals based on family income.\nLib Dem plans would see an immediate extension of free school meals to all 900,000 children living in poverty who currently miss out across both primary and secondary school.\nThe manifesto pledge would be funded by a 4% levy on the share buybacks of FTSE 100 listed corporations, similar to the excise tax on buybacks implemented by President Biden in the US, which could raise around £1.4bn a year.\nShare buybacks occur when companies use profits to inflate their own share price, a practice which critics have warned can come at the expense of productive investment in the economy.\nThe sectors using share buybacks the most are oil and gas giants, banks and large corporations that own a number of food and consumer goods brands. This suggests the practice is being driven by companies profiting from soaring prices during the cost-of-living crisis.\nMartin added: “It is time for change. Every vote for the Liberal Democrats in Colchester is a vote for a local champion who will fight for the wellbeing of children and their futures.\n“I am proud the Liberal Democrats have the most ambitious plan for free school meals of any party, which would save parents money and transform the future for millions of children.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Sue should be frankly ashamed.”\n“What we need to do now is look what improvements are required to ensure Prettygate library is thriving and there for many future generations to continue to enjoy.”\nYour Prettygate Team thank everyone who supported us during this campaign and for displaying our “NO” posters. Together we have all won a battle which frankly it should never have been necessary to fight.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

For the previous year, a staggering 50.1% of children had not been seen by a dentist.\nThis is despite the NHS recommending that under-18s see a dentist at least once a year because their teeth can decay faster, compared to two years for adults. Tooth decay is also the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged 6-10.\nIn East of England, 57.5% of adults have not been seen by an NHS dentist in the past two years. That equates to 2,750,847 people who went without dental care in the last 24 months.\nIt comes as the Liberal Democrats are set to adopt their pre-manifesto at their autumn conference this weekend, including a commitment to reform NHS dentistry so that no one is forced to pay hundreds of pounds for private care\nThe party is also calling for an emergency rescue plan for NHS dentistry, including spending any funding that has gone unspent in recent years to boost the number of appointments as well as the removal of VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nLiberal Democrat Parliamentary spokesperson for Martin Goss, Colchester said:\n“Every parent knows how important it is to ensure that their children can see a dentist when they need to. Leaving children in pain can disrupt their eating, sleeping and learning.\n“This Conservative government has shown a total disregard for every aspect of our health service and the people of Colchester are bearing the brunt of it.

The plans would benefit 3891 small and medium-sized businesses in Colchester, from family-owned high street shops to hairdressers. This would include the 120 cafes, restaurants, pubs and other hospitality businesses in the constituency.\nUnder the proposed Liberal Democrat scheme, small businesses would be able to apply for Government grants covering 80% of the increase in their energy bills for one year, up to a maximum of £50,000. Nationally the proposals would help 1.4 million small businesses across the UK. The party is also calling on the new Prime Minister to introduce laws to support families and businesses with spiralling energy costs as soon as Parliament returns next week.\nThe scheme would cost an estimated £10 billion and could be met by reversing the Conservatives’ planned tax cuts for big banks, which are seeing their profits grow with rising interest rates. That would include cancelling the Government’s cut to the Bank Surcharge that is due to take effect in April 2023 and restoring the Bank Levy to 2015 levels, raising £10.6 billion over the next four years.\nLiberal Democrat Martin Goss said: Colchester’s local high streets risk being devastated by spiralling energy costs and turned into ghost towns, but the Conservatives don’t seem to get it or even care. “Local shops, cafes and restaurants that survived through the Coronavirus pandemic, could now be taken down by soaring energy costs and forced to close their doors unless the Government steps up urgently. “We need this energy bailout now to save our high streets, rescue small businesses and keep prices down for local families. “We’ve known this hike was coming for months and the Government has done nothing. “We cannot waste more time.\nThe new Conservative Prime Minister must act immediately to protect families and small businesses in Colchesteras soon as Parliament returns.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The 70% increase in the energy price cap expected to be announced by Ofgem later this month would be cancelled, with the Government instead paying the shortfall to energy suppliers so that they can afford to supply customers at the current rates.\nThis would mean a total estimated saving for households in Colchester of £146,184,641 off their electricity and gas bills.\nThe Liberal Democrats say the estimated £36 billion cost should be met by expanding the windfall tax on oil and gas company profits and using the Government’s higher-than-expected VAT revenues as a result of soaring inflation.\nThe party is also calling for more targeted support for vulnerable and low-income households. This would include doubling the Warm Homes Discount to £300 and extending it to all those on Universal Credit and Pension Credit while investing in insulating fuel-poor homes to bring prices down in the long term.\nLiberal Democrat Colchester Spokesperson Martin Goss said:\n“Hard-working families in Colchester are already struggling to make ends meet, and are deeply concerned about how they will cope with the predicted rise in energy bills.\n“This Conservative Government is stalling in the face of a national emergency and, yet again, is simply not doing enough to put money back in the pockets of hard-working people.\n“Countless families and pensioners across Colchester are already struggling, and they cannot wait for a new Conservative leader to act.\n“This is an emergency, and the Government must step in now to help families and pensioners in Colchester by cancelling the planned rise in energy bills this October.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Their “zoning” plans risk worsening inequality and leaving whole areas behind.\n“The Conservatives’ plan is that new developments of up to 50 homes may no longer have to provide any affordable housing. This will further reduce the number of affordable homes being built. These proposals are an attack on local democracy and will deny people the chance to have their say on local development.\n“The Liberal Democrats are calling for an urgent housebuilding programme of environmentally friendly social homes for rent.

The shortfall, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, has meant that Councillors of all parties are having to consider how to fill this significant gap and minimise the impact on residents.\nOn Tuesday the Council’s Scrutiny Panel made a proposal to defer this paper to a Task and Finish Group to fully investigate the proposed green waste collection service and wider use of wheelie bins. Tonight, the Cabinet unanimously supported this recommendation. No measures will be put in place until this group have delivered their recommendations as to its viability to Cabinet and then to Full Council.\nSpeaking on Wednesday night Councillor Goss told Cabinet:\n“We are listening generally. We cannot just say we do not like that. You need to come up with answers that you do like and will serve the budget issues.”\nAfter the meeting Councillor Goss said:\n“We are all disappointed at government failure to provide on its commitment to financially support local authorities and avoid additional charges, possible redundancies and cuts in services.\n“I am delighted that there is an opportunity for councillors from all parties to now be able to properly scrutinise the green waste collection and use of wheelie bins. It is important that residents are heard so that priorities of services and cuts during these difficult times are responsive to their wishes.”\n1 Comment\nI think that it is entirely fair to charge £5o a year for garden waste collections.",

The US team even offered ‘public lines’ on chlorine-washed chicken to help UK officials try to sell the controversial practice to British consumers and help ‘inform the media narrative’.\nThe US negotiators also said that maintaining the UK’s current high standards for food production was ‘the worst-case scenario’, adding that in a no deal Brexit there would be ‘all to play for.’\nLiberal Democrat candidate Martin Goss said:\n“These documents show that a Donald Trump post-Brexit trade deal poses a grave threat to farmers across Colchester The US has far lower animal welfare and food standards, especially on the use of chemicals and growth hormones.

To meet the Conservatives’ own target of 449 by March 2023, that rate would have to increase to 12 per month over the next 15 months.\nColchester Liberal Democrats have slammed the government for failing to keep their promise to communities, adding that there needs to be a return to full and proper community policing.\nResponding to the figures, Martin Goss, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Colchester said:\n“People in Colchester are being let down and taken for granted by this Conservative Government. With so many local crimes going unsolved, we desperately need more police on our streets and in our communities.\n“Liberal Democrats are calling for a return to proper community policing, where officers are visible, trusted and known personally to local people.” “The Conservatives’ pledge to boost police officer numbers looks set to become yet another of their broken promises. They are letting down victims of crime and our communities right across our area.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply"
