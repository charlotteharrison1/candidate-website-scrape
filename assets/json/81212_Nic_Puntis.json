They are all well-respected and well known within the community. Professionally, Nic has worked in every town within the new constituency and has long advocated for them alongside the neighbouring villages. He is currently a Chippenham Town Councillor and Wiltshire Councillor serving the residents of Cepen Park and Derriads and has previously been a Parish Councillor for Dauntsey, being successfully elected in 2011.\nAfter Graduating in 1992 with an Honours Degree in Land & Construction Management, Nic worked in Chippenham, starting as a trainee Surveyor before his local knowledge was used to start a chain of Estate Agents. Branches were opened within each of the four towns and he employed all local people. Nic bought his first home in Lowden, Chippenham and has since been privileged to live across the Chippenham area with his family as they grew up. Nic set up his own Property Development Business in 2001, where he worked on small-scale property development projects. Nic has since retired from this business and is now a co-partner of Sarah-Jaynes Café, named after his wife, on Chippenham High Street, which they continue to operate as a successful business, using primarily locally sourced products, supporting local businesses. Nic was also a keen sportsman in his youth, playing for local clubs and county in Rugby and Football, he also continues to support his local clubs as well as enjoying his keen interest in motorsport and walking throughout our beautiful countryside with his family and Jack Russell, Max. Nic's Daughter is a Solicitor in Chippenham and his son-in-law is an Architect in Corsham.\nIn 2010, Nic was diagnosed with a rare cancer called GIST Cancer, two years later his wife, Sarah-Jayne, was also diagnosed with Breast Cancer, both have since undergone surgery and intensive chemotherapy and are now cancer-free. This experience hardened both of their resolve to enjoy life to the full and set Nic on a path to help others. Following Nic’s personal experience with cancer, he became a trustee of 2 Cancer Charities, roles he still holds today. In 2021, Nic was a candidate in the unitary elections of Wiltshire Council, where he was successfully elected to represent the ward of Cepen Park and Derriads. Alongside representing his constituents, Nic is currently the Portfolio Holder for Flooding at Wiltshire Council, ensuring our county is protected from flood-based disasters.\nThe Puntis name is one that is well known within the Chippenham area with Nic’s mother working as a PE teacher in Hardenhuish School for 20 years and then as an EBD teacher at Sheldon School. Nic’s father spent his entire career working in Corsham at Leafield Engineering. Both of Nic’s grandfathers worked within the constituency, one at Westinghouse Brake & Signals and the other as a Pig Farmer, where Nic spent most of his time growing up.\nNic has been a strong advocate for Chippenham Rugby, working alongside local media to ensure the access to the ruby club is maintained and approved when the duelling for the A350 takes place. He will continue to advocate for this and will work with local residents and councillors to open railway stations in Corsham and Royal Wootton Bassett.\nNic’s involvement in the hospitality industry, owning Sarah-Jaynes Café and being involved in the running of Soho Public House in Derry Hill, has helped him understand the challenges faced by the industry first hand, more poignantly, from the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and rising prices, due to inflation fuelled by the war in Ukraine. Nic will actively campaign and advocate for further support for our communities that rely on pubs and restaurants as Community Hubs. Nic continues to keep in touch with the challenges of owning and running of pubs, through his nephew and his wife, who own the Royal Wootton Bassett Pub, this engagement will continue with Nic speaking regularly to owners of local businesses to find out what is affecting them and how he can help them prosper, enriching our local economy. A major part of our constituency is home to members of our brave Armed Forces, Nic’s father was in the Navy and his Grandfather was a Royal Marine during the Second World War, reinforcing his desire to be a strong advocate for further support and recognition to those who serve our great country. Nic is a strong advocate for the community, as he has already shown in the community of Cepen Park and Derriads, he is both a representative the community, can be proud of, and rely upon, to best represent your interests on the council and beyond.",

Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Nic Puntis, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data. The Register of Electors that councils provide to authorised persons under the Representation of the People Act is also used for electoral purposes.\n5.

Special category data\nSpecial category data will be processed under the lawful basis indicated in section 3, as is permitted in clauses 22, 23 and 24 of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act, covering political parties and elected representatives.\n7. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8.

We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

  "https_www_nicpuntis_uk_/https_www_nicpuntis_uk_socialmediapolicy/content_9.html": "I am honoured to have been selected as the Conservative Councillor/Candidate for Cepen Park and Derriads in Chippenham. This is an honour which I take very seriously, and I am keen to hear from, and engage with, as many constituents as possible. I do this through running surveys, holding surgeries, visiting businesses and charities, and responding to emails, letters, phone calls, casework, and policy queries. I also use my official social media channels to promote what the Conservatives are doing to help constituents, and the work that I am carrying out as the local Councillor. I also use my social media accounts to celebrate achievements in our area.\nAs a Conservative Councillor/Candidate, I always try to do what I feel is the best for Cepen Park and Derriads and while I have a particular political viewpoint, which I know not everyone will agree with, I also know that others will have their own views and opinions. I respect this. Even if I do not agree with someone’s views, it is their right to have a different viewpoint to mine.\nThere are a number of ground rules that I, in common with many of my colleagues on all sides of the political spectrum have set for my social media channels. These have been designed to ensure that all interactions are compatible with the principles of common courtesy, respect, and good manners. Sadly, there are some who wish to abuse my social media accounts for their own purposes. I do not believe that this is right, and I do not do this to others with different views to myself.\nI, as a Councillor, like everyone have the right to protect myself and others from any threats of harassment and abuse. My social media channels are my own platform, owned and curated by myself and/or select members of my team, to express my positions and highlight information that I think that the people of the division should be aware of.\nI try to respond to comments on my social media channels as much as I can. I will respond a lot more on Facebook but rarely respond to comments on Twitter. Because responses are intermittent, please do not expect an answer via social media and if your question is important, always email me.\nWhere I may have done so in the past, I will certainly not be responding to a comment that is designed to cause anger, division, abuse or hate.\nThese platforms are not an appropriate place to raise casework issues or matters that need an in-depth response or analysis. Comments are not a substitute for emails, and I will not be able to action them, such as when I forward an email to a local partner or to your local Member of Parliament. More often than not, it is better to put your question/comment into an email to me at [email protected].\nThe ground rules that I have set for my social media channels are as follows.\n- The primary aim of my social media accounts is to serve constituents in the Chippenham Cepen Park and Derriads division. If you are identified as not living or working in the division, you may have your comments ignored, hidden, or removed. If you are not a constituent and you consistently breech or even bend the other rules below then you will find yourself blocked.\n- Abuse and threats of any kind will not be tolerated – even if you think that the words that you have used are mild or were posted with tongue in cheek. Any comments that my team and/or I feel are not polite or respectful may be hidden or deleted without prior notice and the account that is posting them may be blocked and reported to the social media companies and to the Police. We have a zero-tolerance policy which means that we will report all threats and abuse.\n- While I welcome feedback, the comments sections of my social media channels are not to be used by opposition activists or organisations to promote their own political views or campaigns. If they follow the rules that are set by the social media company, they should be able to create their own page or account or contribute to the many groups that are created for online political discourse. Likewise, comments that are intended to deflect or divert attention from the content of the main post may be removed without prior notice.\n- Spamming is not tolerated. This includes persistent posting of comments across multiple posts or platforms that basically say the same thing or posting an unrelated comment to the original post. These comments will be deleted and the account that is posting them may be blocked without any prior notice.\n- Advertising of any kind is not permitted and any genuine recommendations of products or services that people make in the comments are the responsibility of the person making the recommendation.\nRevised on 22nd September 2024 to reflect my position as a Wiltshire & Town Councillor and the passing of the General Election on 4th July 2024 as there are no longer any Parliamentary Candidates for any political party. These changes have been applied throughout my website.",

One recent decision by Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sparked significant concern among many, particularly the elderly. Starmer has chosen to remove Winter Fuel support, a crucial allowance that thousands of pensioners rely on to stay warm during the coldest months.\nIn Wiltshire alone, this decision will impact 98,679 pensioners, leaving them vulnerable to the harsh realities of winter without the financial assistance they once depended on. The loss of this allowance raises serious questions about the wellbeing of our elderly community and the priorities that guide political decision-making. As the cold season approaches, these pensioners face an uncertain future, highlighting the profound impact of political choices on everyday lives.",

  "https_www_nicpuntis_uk_/https_www_nicpuntis_uk_freeparkingchippenham/content_14.html": "Chippenham Town Council is currently reviewing a proposal to introduce subsidised free parking across all Wiltshire Council-owned car parks in the town. This initiative, put forward by Conservative Councillors Nic Puntis and Robert Giles, is aimed at stimulating the local economy by making it more convenient for residents and visitors to access shops and businesses in Chippenham.\nAfter extensive conversations with both residents and business owners, it has become evident that offering one or two hours of subsidised free parking could have a positive impact on the town’s economy by encouraging greater footfall in the town centre.\nNic and Robert have introduced this motion to initiate a formal debate on free parking. They are encouraged by the level of community engagement, with many Chippenham residents sharing their views. The councillors will outline the pros and cons of the proposal, explain the reasoning behind the associated costs, and take into account all public feedback before making a final decision on whether to support the motion.\nKey Points of the Proposal:\n- The Council will vote on whether to provide one or two hours of free parking.\n- If approved, the scheme would result in a precept increase for taxpayers (without changes to the council’s current budget):\n- One hour free: approximately £3.40 per month (18.2% increase)\n- Two hours free: approximately £4.10 per month (21.1% increase)\nCllr Nic Puntis and Cllr Robert Giles are also investigating alternative funding solutions that could minimise any financial impact on Chippenham residents.\nIn other nearby towns like Corsham, similar schemes have proven successful in boosting local economies by encouraging visitors to explore the town without worrying about parking costs.\nThis motion has the potential to benefit local businesses, increase foot traffic, and make Chippenham a more attractive destination for both shoppers and tourists.\nWe encourage you to share your thoughts on whether you support this initiative below.\nIf you have any comments about the motion please contact your local Town Councillor or contact me at [email protected].\nView the motion on the Chippenham Town Council Website here."
