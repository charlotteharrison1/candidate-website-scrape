I depend on the same shops, schools, healthcare, transport and businesses that you do. I want to see our city coming to life, with local people able to shape our community. We can have a healthy economy, fuelled by innovative small and growing businesses. We can have healthcare that’s easy to access, fast and fit for the future. We can have a sustainable future and a city rich in nature and green spaces. We can have streets where everyone feels safe all the time. And we can break down the barriers to opportunity for every single child and adult. I’m here to help us get there by working together creatively and collaboratively.\nTogether, let’s build a brighter future for Worcester."
