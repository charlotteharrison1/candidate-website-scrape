They were joined by affected University students & Robert & Maggie Abrahart who lost their daughter (Natasha Abrahart) to suicide.\nAbout the Event\nStudents at University are particularly vulnerable to mental health struggles as they're often living away from home and dealing with the stresses of adult life for the first time. Mental health and wellbeing impacts on a student’s ability to engage with the world around them. A recent report by The Insight Network and student organisation Dig-In, found that one in five students has a current mental health diagnosis. The survey also found that:\n- Almost half of the 21,000 students surveyed have experienced a serious psychological issue for which they needed professional help\n- Students in the second and third year of university were at significantly higher risk than first years for feelings of worry, loneliness, substance misuse and thoughts of self-harm\n- Almost half of students reported thoughts of self-harm\n- More than three quarters have concealed their symptoms due to fears of stigma.\nIn this discussion we looked at developing policies that can help students in university with mental health concerns and considering the responsibility that universities have towards students, given the difficulties that many face.\nNaz Panju: 'We must do more to protect our students. Its a proud moment when politics makes a difference in lives!

The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation.

It's relevant to revisit this issue given ongoing concerns about China's interventions in the country.\nhttps://www.conservativepolicyforum.com/event-details/what-should-we-do-with-international-students\nAbout the Event\nIn order to stay and work in the UK after graduation an international student has four months to apply for a Visa and get a job paying at least £20,800 per year. Although the number of international students in the UK was growing it is now not as fast as the growth in students going to countries like Canada or Australia who both have a more welcoming visa system. Should we create a more welcoming visa system? Are the UK Universities becoming financially dependant on overseas students? Will demand continue to increase and what about the future of online courses instead of physically coming to the UK? What impact will COVID-19 have on International student numbers? How does the more recent Chinese influence / involvement into the British Education system impact us? What are the benefits and risks of such involvement / investment and should the government intervene to control this? What should we do with International Students?\nNaz Panju: 'It must raise alarm bells when any country is buying our several of our education establishments'",
