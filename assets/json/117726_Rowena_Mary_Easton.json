Career politicians are interested in gaining power, but have no ideas for how to use it to make the country better.\nWilliam and Michael explore the reasons for this and finish on a positive note: the recent political upheaval will bring at least three by-elections, and the SDP will offer the public a decent choice at the ballot box.\nThe 3 failed old legacy parties must be swept away there’s real clamour for change in the UK Sunak and Starmer offer nothing new neither will do anything to improve the dire state of Britain the Cons I believe will scrape Home at the next election albeit with a smaller majority as Starmer’s crew will scare people away the SDP must be the alternative Government maybe a Prime Minister Clouston",

All Ian’s life he has contributed to the local community in and around South East Wales holding many roles including serving as a Magistrate for 22 years. He is Vice Chair of the Treorchy Branch of the RAF Association, having served as a Flight Lieutenant in the Volunteer Reserve, Vice Chair of Pontypridd High School Governing body and Vice Chair of the Astronomical Society at Cardiff University.\nSDP Policies:\n- Clean Brexit\n- Controlled end to austerity with increased NHS spending\n- Lower immigration\n- Larger Army, Navy and Air Force – for defence not foreign wars\n- National programme of Council House building\n- Turnover tax for tax-avoiding multinationals\n- Railway re-nationalisation\nLocal Issues:\n- Support M4 Newport relief road\n- Work to attract science and technology companies to Newport – to bring skilled jobs to the city\n- Improve Transport for Wales trains and rolling stock\n- Regeneration of Newport city centre with positive action to combat homelessness\nIan McLean, SDP Candidate, “I am delighted to have been accepted by the SDP to stand as their candidate for the people of Newport West and if elected, regardless of your political persuasion, I will do my utmost to bring about a better and fairer community for you and everyone within the constituency.\nWhilst Brexit is of course the big topic of the moment, there is more to this by-election than just that. It’s about Newport West and its constituents and about bringing much needed improvements, jobs and investment into the area.\nThe M4 Relief Road has for far too long been delayed; the valleys railways are in desperate need of upgrading; crime, homelessness and living rough have increased.\nFor far too long this constituency has been neglected by the Conservative Government, the Labour Council and the Labour controlled Welsh Assembly and it’s time for that to change!\nThe SDP is all about Common Sense Politics for Decent People, which is what everyone in Newport West deserves!”\nWilliam Clouston, SDP Party Leader, “The SDP is delighted to have selected a strong local candidate Ian McLean to fight the Newport West by election. Ian has vast experience as a Magistrate, School Governor and will make a great MP.”\nAbout Ian\nIan has been an active campaigner for the local community and has stood in local council elections in the Abercynon ward of Rhondda Cynon Taff in early 2017 and again in the General Election of 2017 for the Cynon Valley Constituency.\nIan has occupied several community roles serving as a Magistrate in Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil as well as Vice Chair of Pontypridd High School Governing body and Vice Chair and Assistant Observatory Manager of Cardiff Astronomical Society, at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University. He has recently been elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nAs a former Flight Lieutenant Commissioned Officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAF VRT), Ian has run three Air Cadet Squadrons within the Air Training Corps. He is Vice Chair of the Treorchy Branch of the Royal Air Force Association (RAFA).\nIan started work in the Structure Planning Department of Mid Glamorgan County Council in 1977, and since then has worked for BT including planning Super-Fast Broadband, essential for rural communities and for making Wales attractive to businesses.\nIan enjoys studying languages and foreign culture. He passed the Japanese Ministry of Education exam in Japanese language at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), and gained a Diploma in Chinese Language and Culture at the University of Wales, College of Cardiff.\nAbout the Social Democratic Party\nThe SDP represents the radical centre of British politics today, believing the market and the state have a complementary role to play in rebuilding Britain. The Party aims to provide a political home to all social democrats who seek a stronger and more capable state along with greater individual responsibility, trust and a focus on the needs of communities. The SDP supports the nation state, democracy and Brexit.\nEnds.\nTo arrange an interview with Ian McLean please call him on 07752 306944\nFor Media Enquiries please contact the SDP Press Office at pressoffice@sdp.org.uk\nRegistered Address of The Social Democratic Party, 272 Bath Street, Glasgow, G2 4JR",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_time-for-elecroral-reform/content_86.html": "In 2005 I could vote in a General Election for the first time. I had studied Government and Politics at A Level and having supported one candidate during a mock election campaign at my school, it was exciting getting to exercise a vote for real. The same year I was on my way to university too, to study history and politics. That experience proved transformative to me – my worldview had been changed.\nAt school, I was politically biased in favour of one party. By the time I went to university, I was not sure whether I should become a member of any party or just vote for the same one again and again. But amid that uncertainty I could still see the value of MPs. During the summer of 2009, I helped out at Watford and Norwich North, telephone canvassing, meeting voters on their doorsteps and handing out flyers. It was around the time of the expenses scandal. There was a lot of understandable anger from voters.\nHowever, I got to understand why MPs are so crucial for their constituents in many ways.\nAnd yet I went to vote in the 2010 General Election with a sense of disillusionment. I am not proud to say that at the polling station I spoiled my ballot paper. But I was not happy with what any of the main parties had to offer at the time. Small wonder then that in the 2011 national referendum on the electoral system I voted Yes to the Alternative Vote. I had long concluded that First Past the Post should be scrapped.\nWhy so? Put simply, it does not do what it asserts it does. As shown by the Electoral Reform Society, the post is all over the place. There is no consistency. The relationship between the number of votes cast and the seats won by parties is erratic, to say the least. Furthermore, candidates or incumbent MPs can also win seats with less than 50% of the total vote or even at a lower percentage.\nHaving not participated in a national referendum before, I found it refreshing to see individuals cross party-boundaries and come up with arguments for and against the Alternative Vote on their own merits rather than rigidly sticking to party policy platforms. All the same, the Yes to AV campaign lost the 2011 referendum. I think it was a blow for British politics. Here’s why.\nSince the 1997 General Election, we have had significant constitutional change. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland got parliaments/assemblies. In 1999 Members of the European Parliament were elected using the party list system. In 2000, London could elect a mayor again, and an Assembly. For over 20 years now, a generation of voters and politicians have used different electoral systems throughout the United Kingdom. None of those new bodies use First Past the Post.\nPolice and Crime Commissioner elections were introduced in 2012 and more and more cities across England directly elect metropolitan or metro mayors. They do not use First Past the Post. In 2007, Scottish local government elections have used the Single Transferable Vote and, at the time of writing, there is a proposal to have STV used for Welsh local government elections too. You have better representation of voters who like the main parties in those bodies and those systems have given opportunities to minor parties or independents that they never would have had had First Past the Post been used.\nFor General Elections, we persist in using First Past the Post – and it bemuses me why. Clearly, it does not work. Indeed, it runs counter to the spirit of the democratic ideal. In usual daily life, when something does not deliver what it says it does – be it an app, car, restaurant and so on – you stop using it and find something else. We have good alternatives to First Past the Post already in Britain. And yet we stick with it.\nWe used alternatives before the 1950 General Election. Before that election, London, Oxford and Cambridge, Queen’s University Belfast, the University of Wales and Combined English and Scottish Universities had their own constituencies. Those seats used STV. It has been only for 73 years that First Past the Post has been solely used for General Elections. That’s a long time – but not so long that things cannot be changed.\nAll voters and all parties have, in effect, been cheated since 1950. In the 1951 election, Labour outpolled the Conservatives and lost the election. In February 1974, the Conservatives outpolled Labour and lost the election.\nThe most recent General Election, in 2019, saw the Conservatives offer an EU withdrawal agreement in their manifesto. The result was an 80-seat majority for them in Parliament and a Corbyn-led Labour comprehensively defeated. Britain consequently left the EU.\nBut just how big was the swing to the Conservatives compared to the 2017 election, one which had an indecisive result? It amounted to just 270,000 voters switching to them nationwide, or 1.2%\nAnd this kind of disparity has happened again and again back through the history of FPTP. Voters were likewise cheated at the June 1983 election. Then the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher insisted during the campaign that Britain was on the right track with her policies and should not turn back. Compared to the May 1979 General Election, they dropped a few percentage points. However, they achieved a then landslide majority of 144 seats, in no small part due to what proved to be a catastrophic Labour campaign under Michael Foot. The Thatcher government went on to remodel society in ways few governments have matched since.\nNow consider the story of the Social Democratic Party around that time. The SDP was born in January 1981 and, led by four former Labour Government Cabinet Ministers, entered an alliance with the Liberal Party. The Alliance did well. An upswing of 11 points nationwide – and 25.4% of the popular vote – compared to the Liberal performance in 1979. A great result for a new party. What was the return? Just 23 MPs.\nLabour still had 209 MPs despite a terrible performance at the ballot box. If the electoral system had been proportional, there would have been 165 Alliance MPs elected. We can only ponder what that could have meant for British politics and the generations that followed?\nIn more recent years prominent political thinkers have been more outspoken in calling for a new party system to truly reflect Britain’s many divisions. That still feels some way off, given how First Past the Post protects the two main parties and cheats millions of voters who do not vote for them. Neither the Conservatives, nor Labour, are likely to give it up any time soon. Surely the steady collapse of turn-out figures at the polls reflects the despondency that this situation engenders.\nI personally feel politically disenfranchised – I am not a member of any party and feel that any vote I make outside of the FPTP’s limited options is unlikely to be of equal consequence. Much as I felt when I spoiled that ballot paper many years ago, I still feel cheated. Come the next General Election, those born in the years 2004-05 will be the newest generation eligible to of vote. They are likely to feel cheated too.\nIf their votes are to matter – if any of our votes are to matter – it’s time to scrap First Past the Post.\nDespite the So-called opinion polls the Tories are most likely to win the next election if Sunak goes ahead and repeals the NetZero nonsense if We replaced the absurd first past the post We will get a Social Democratic Party Government\nFPTP mirrors the decline of the British economy as it simply produces the same results time after time. Back in 1981 the call from the SDP was to break the mould. Unfortunately even after some amazing results we were unable to break the mould and the decline continued.\nWe would finally remove the grip of the 3 failed old legacy parties if fptp was replaced with a more sensible voting system the SDP may even form a Government with a comfortable majority with its sensible policies until first past the post is removed We will get Sunak Starmer and Davey instead 3 of the most mediocre politicians in recent years\nHas the SDP published the results of the 2024 election i.e. how many votes did they receive and what action are you planning to take, if anything, towards some form of proportional representation into the future?",

Councillor Bright is an experienced local campaigner and a former Conservative Candidate for Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner.\nSDP Leader commented:\n“I’m delighted that Cllr Bright has joined us. Richard will be a great asset to the SDP in Derbyshire and the East Midlands. We look forward to working with him. It’s a strong vindication of how far the SDP has progressed that such senior Councillor has come aboard. A magnificent boost – particularly after the SDP’s stunning victory in getting Councillor Wayne Dixon elected earlier this year in Leeds.”\nCouncillor Richard Bright commented:\n“After over 20 years as a loyal and active member of the Conservative Party I’ve made the decision to become member of the SDP. I can no longer be part of Conservative Party that is so out of touch with the people of this amazing country. A cut in upper rate of tax is inappropriate at a time when families throughout Britain face such a difficult winter.\nEven with a parliamentary majority the Conservatives have failed to produce a coherent energy policy and are in charge of an NHS where a 9 hour wait for Ambulance is now common place.\nThe good people of the UK deserve better, and the SDP can deliver.

In England, the BHC’s mandate will be implemented by newly established County Housing Corporations (CHCs) and in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland by the devolved governments.\n- CHCs will have powers to make Compulsory Purchase Orders to acquire necessary land and the ability to grant planning permission for their developments. They will take ownership of all social housing stock currently administered by local authorities. After a transitory moratorium to allow social housing stock to be replenished, we will re-introduce Right to Buy with the proviso that sold property must be replaced one-for-one by CHCs using the receipts of sale.\n- The BHC will establish skills colleges to rapidly scale Britain’s construction workforce, and the ability to invest in the development of new technologies to help improve productivity.\n- Private housing developers will be levied a 50% tax on the uplift to land value attributable to the granting of planning permission on all greenfield sites and undeveloped land.\n- We will apply a moratorium on buy-to-let mortgages with the aim of re-balancing the housing market towards the interests of young people and owner-occupiers.\n- We will bring forward legislation to increase security of tenure and to encourage longer term tenancies in the private rented sector.\n- All residential let property will require a ‘Conditions Certificate’ (a housing ‘MOT’) issued by a new Housing Standards Inspectorate. It will be illegal to collect rent on any home that has failed to obtain its Conditions Certificate – for example, for poor standards of property maintenance – for the full period that it has no Conditions Certificate.\n- Married British families will be given preference in social housing allocation and the housing needs of military veterans will be prioritised.\n- Homelessness will be tackled via a combination of increased provision of supervised hostel places with support services relating to drug, alcohol, and mental health issues. Vagrancy will no longer be “enabled by indifference”, and people sleeping rough will be escorted to safe and secure accommodation.\nHousing\nThe aim of housing policy is to make available a decent, affordable home for every citizen but no recent government has come close to securing this. Instead, the deliberate destruction of state housebuilding capacity together with mass immigration has created a perfect storm which denies millions a viable route to start a family and unfairly dashes young people’s dreams of a home of their own. We believe in urgently reversing this trend by reinvigorating state housebuilding and removing market distortions which prevent housing supply meeting demand.",

Instead of simply paying for the care, the NHS keeps the patient in hospital and blames the local council. The council doesnt get this £300 per day from the NHS, and is instead struggling to source and fund enough care for existing clients from its own coffers, and several are going bust as a result. So the patient stays in hospital where they deteriorate, the hospital loses a bed, and the taxpayer gets stuffed.\nSolution… Merge Health and Social Care into one organisation.

Instead, our party calls on the government to support the creation of emergency domestic training schemes to alleviate ongoing labour shortages in these sectors.\nFor too long, businesses in food production, logistics, and hospitality have grown used to a low-productivity and low-wage model, propped up by endless reserves of cheap foreign labour. This model favoured short-term profits rather than long-term investment, and made many of our fellow citizens substantially poorer – hitting the working class the hardest.\nInstead, we call for a high-productivity and high-wage model that improves the livelihoods of working families and sees British businesses become more competitive. To do this, however, businesses must be willing to invest in training and upskilling their workers, while also providing them with good wages and working conditions.\nIn crumbling to the pressure of business groups by creating this visa scheme, the government has shown that it lacks belief in creating a new model which prioritises domestic skills and training.\n“Britain is currently facing a shortage of labour in a variety of sectors – most notably in hospitality, food production, and logistics,” says SDP Leader William Clouston.\n“This is largely the result of a failure of successive governments to train enough people in the UK to serve our needs as we switch away from open labour markets.”\n“Over the past forty years pay and working conditions deteriorated in many sectors, to the point where many no longer allow Britons to support a family. Businesses have been able to do this through access to unlimited foreign labour to drive wages and working standards to the bottom. Thankfully, this process is ending.”\n“The days of endless imported cheap labour are gone. No sensible person would expect recent changes in labour market to occur without some adaptation. The key thing to grasp is that the occasional supply line interruption is a price worth paying for UK workers to finally get a break – along with the higher wages they deserve. If that means that the range of sandwich fillings is temporarily diminished, so be it.”",

We believe – along with millions of Scottish people – that the Bill is irrational, unworkable and harmful to both young people and to women’s sex-based rights.\nIn fully de-medicalising the legal recognition process for trans identities the SNP and Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs have made law that denies the salience of sex-based rights and blurs the legal distinction between men and women in Scotland. The GRR also undermines parental responsibility. It makes harms more likely, not less likely.\nSDP Leader William Clouston, states:\n“It’s not just that the Scottish Bill is wrong. It’s that it has wider effects on UK equality legislation. The Scottish government has created a situation of potential legal conflict. If a biological male self-identifies as female and obtains a Scottish gender recognition certificate – will they be legally female throughout the rest of the UK?\nFurthermore, there are many areas – such as Driving Licensing and national passports – which are UK competences and where the question of legal sex must remain fully under UK control. The government is right to strike the Scottish Bill down and the SDP fully supports it in doing so.”\nSDP policy on Transgender and Biological Sex-based rights can be found here:\nhttps://sdp.org.uk/policies/transgender-and-biological-sex-based-rights/",

However, you should also talk to Thomas about MMT. The SDP’s current economic policies are pretty much aligned with the daft Stability and Growth pact which has achieved precisely the opposite (instability and no growth) for the EU.\n>>> “setting a target for average public sector deficits across the cycle of 2.5% to 3% of GDP.” This is straight out of Article 123 of the treaties.\nRead ‘Reclaiming the State’, or re-read it if you’ve forgotten.

Effectively the votes of 17.4m people have been stolen and are now to be destroyed.\n“The Tories, Labour and all the establishment parties have decided to trash democracy by reneging on election pledges to respect the referendum verdict.\n“It is a staggering spectacle to behold. I urge voters to resolve not to vote for any party that countenances any further delay to a full WTO Brexit. Parties that do not respect your vote do not deserve your vote.\n“The SDP is the party to join and support for all Leave voters who wish to see the result of the referendum implemented, investment in public services increased on the home front and no quarter given to extremism.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_corporations-british-or-global/content_33.html": "One of the differences between the Korean and British responses to Covid has been the way in which the Korean government could look to – and expect – help from the private sector, because Korea’s largest companies are, in a word, patriotic.\nCompare this to the FTSE 100, the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nHow many of these companies think of themselves as primarily and essentially British, as opposed to ‘global’?\nThe answer is not many. Seeing themselves as ‘global’ companies, most see no obligation to put themselves on the line to help Britain and its people. And, quite pitifully, it seems that our Government shares these low expectations. I expect that the most that these companies will have done to help is sponge up whatever subsidies are going.\nThere are exceptions however. Burberry and BAE spring to mind. But for the most part, the leadership of FTSE 100 companies haven’t seen much shareholder value in helping, so haven’t done anything.\nIn South Korea, corporations are patriotic for a reason. For generations, South Korean governments have fostered and promoted their industrial sector by sheer force of strategic necessity. Those longstanding ties are of course controversial and the historic closeness between government and chaebol (large family-owned conglomerates) is quite corrupt. Nevertheless, when a crisis presented itself, there was never any doubt that Korea’s largest listed companies would view themselves as principally Korean, and know that they would and should be called upon to put their shoulders to the wheel.\nMeanwhile, back in Britain, we have had to rely on individual acts to show our social solidarity. The grit and determination of Captain Tom Moore, a Second World War veteran who raised more than £30 million for the NHS by the time of his 100th birthday, stands in stark contrast to the indifference of ‘our’ corporate sector.\nWhen a TV reporter asked him for his plans, Captain Tom gave a classic Yorkshire reply: “I’ll carry on walking as long as they carry on giving. Let’s see who gives up first.”\nThe contrast between Tom and our corporate leadership is not flattering to the latter. The SDP believes that government and business have mutual obligations to each other, because that’s what builds an economy, and also what builds national resilience into our economic system. We don’t have that anymore, and it will take the SDP’s reinstatement of active industrial policy to turn it around.\nI fully agree. I think state money should go into fostering strategic businesses. Without support there will be little advancement.\nThe same global companies who see no obligation to help Britain and it’s people are very quick to come begging for a bailout courtesy of the British taxpayer when their businesses are struggling though.

But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible; and above all, let finance be primarily national.”\n~ J.M. Keynes\nDuring the Covid pandemic, many people have started to rethink globalisation.\nHowever, whilst economic liberals have all too predictably defended the status quo ante, many on the metropolitan left have also failed to articulate a case for returning industry and production to the United Kingdom.\nThe old internationalist left used to argue for fairer wages and better working conditions for all; it used to understand some basic economic principles about surplus labour driving down wages and working conditions. The old internationalist left also understood that employers would try to pit workers against one another according to their sex, ethno-national identity or race and worked to prevent this.\nHowever, today’s intersectional left is most enthusiastic at highlighting these differences and promoting such antagonistic practices.\nWhen labour market ‘shortages’ appear, the value of labour increases. A surplus of labour meanwhile drives down wages and, with it, working conditions. After the Spanish flu for example, because of labour shortages the wages of factory workers in the US more than doubled. [1][2]\nInstead of taking the opportunity to rethink globalised supply chains and labour relations, on today’s metropolitan left the tendency is more to argue unthinkingly for open borders and/or wistfully brandish images of Communist iconography like the far left activist Ash Sarkar did on May Day. They do this without realising that unregulated movement was not even permitted within the territories of the former Soviet Union; sometimes you needed a pass to move between the internal regions of the old Soviet Bloc.\nWe can either have social democracy or we can have untrammelled economic liberalism, but we can’t have both. Under our current version of globalisation, with its supranational institutions, the ability of nation states to protect citizenry and strike social contracts has been undermined. Within deregulated labour markets, increasingly transnational corporations have been empowered to go shopping around the world for the best deal, meaning the lightest regulation and the easiest exploitation of workers.\nIn its backing for this supranational regime, the ‘open borders left’ has unwittingly aligned with the exploitation of workers. In its blanket dismissal of anything construed as ‘nationalist’, it has been seduced by the policies of ruthless laissez-faire globalisers. Where once social democrats understood the need for a sensible controlled immigration policy, for the sake of all workers, today’s metropolitan left argues for policies which would mean the saturation of labour markets, thus enabling business to drastically undercut national workers. The open border left is inadvertently arguing for the needs of capital against the needs of labour.\nOne has to ask if the left globalisers of today would have championed colonialism and imperialism as fervently, as these were also forms of economic globalisation.\nThe idea of a global labour market is one of economic liberalism, in which human beings appear as commodities to be bought and traded, as raw material. In this formulation, there are no social contracts and no systems of social security; peoples’ access to the material prerequisites of life is predicated upon selling their labour in this system.\nThis is a global race to the bottom, in which the lowest bidder wins. This is arguably one of the most degrading conceptions of humanity and certainly not one that the left should be arguing for.\n[1] Garrett, T. A.

It is couched in such jargon as to appeal only to other dedicated academics. If the SDP is to attract voters it needs to speak to a mass audience. It needs to appeal to sufficient people in language they understand in order to gain at least a measurable proportion of the vote.\nThe last time I wrote to the SDP office I got some sort of dismissive form letter. I reported this back and received a similar but personalised reply. Two strikes. Let’s hope this won’t make the third.\nAll makes perfect sense to me. I’m not an academic. I think the article is very well and clearly written.\nYou must have read a different article to the one that I did. Quite straightforward in plain English\nI disagree, the article is clearly written using the approbate terminology. The populous/working class can understand it too.\nVery good thought provoking article which I’m sure will engage a lot of readers.\nShared on Twitter! Very good piece, thank you.\nGreat article ,\nthe left has sold out what it used to perceive as its natural constituency- the working class and now are bed fellows with the neo liberals , strange times indeed .\nGreat article\nThe left has abandoned what used to be its natural constituency – the working class , they are now bed\nfellows with the neo liberals , strange times.\nGreat article. Hits the nail on the head. I disagree with the previous commenter — I don’t think this is overly academic. Plus the party needs both a rigorous political philosophy to stand on as well as broad popular appeal.\nPart, quite a large part, of the current pandemic is a consequence of globally dispersed manufacturing and supply networks. The tragedy of the commons applies, and standards of safety are sacrificed in favour of cheapness and expediency. The democratic polities need to recognise the dangers of freewheeling global trade and production. This recognition should result in readjustment of economies to encourage local autonomy in manufacturing and production. Transport costs, having fallen to trivial levels with cheap air transport, and cheaper container shipping, are likely to increase in a post-Covid19 world. This should bias procurement in favour of sources nearer to home.\nVery well written, piece. Thank you.\nAn excellent piece which clearly explains in danger in the current strategy pursued by the ‘progressive’left\nYes, and what a perverse situation we are now in, where the misty-eyed internationalist left has become a bedfellow of the hawk-eyed globalist corporations. I wonder what old Karl would make of it.\nAn excellent summary. The disappointing aspect of recent times is that the SDP was unable to capitalise on the disaffection among many traditional Labour voters who rejected Corbyn’s leadership and felt no option but to either not vote (I know several) or vote conservative (for Brexit). That was a great opportunity.\nArticles such as this really do get to the rub but without a more dynamic leadership, most people are simply unaware that the SDP could be a genuine home for them. If the party is to make serious progress it really does need its own Nigel Farage character to generate the level of publicity required. I fear the SDP might have now missed the window of opportunity and that Starmer will start to regain some of those lost voters which is a real shame because many of the SDPs policies offer a genuine opportunity for changes to the good. I’m sorry this will be disappointing for some people but it is just how I view our time.\nGood article and one reason why I am looking again to the SDP, after a very long absence. One facet of the argument was the recognition that labour as a commodity actually undermines any idea of a social contract between individuals which is consensual.\nThough I believe we as a nation must become more uk centred, are we certain the left is all for globalisation. Examples of this please.\nEnjoyed your article. Where do you think we are headed under this 5 year government? Where will we be in 20 years time?\nAgree with everything in this analysis. Identity politics started in earnest under Obama as a substitute for the real politics that his country needed, and now this deceptive diversion seems to be well entrenched in the labour party. The Tories won’t care if you self-identify as a chimp as long as they can spin economic illusions like austerity and QE welfare to the bankers.\nI live in Bristol. Once we understand what kind of measures might be needed to make meetings safe in relation to Covid 19, I would very much like the SDP to organise a short conference in this area. Any chance of that?\nExcellent article, I love the opening quotation from JMK and agree with all Sadia says,\nVery well written, the tone and language strikes the right balance.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_history-reveals-the-right-response-the-proposed-chagos-islands-deal-says-danmcnay-specifically-the-falklands-war-of-1982/content_182.html": "History reveals the right response to the proposed Chagos Islands deal, says DAN McNAY – specifically the Falklands War of 1982\nFor over two hundred years, British citizens have lived on the Falkland Islands. They have lived there peacefully and happily, having first arrived when the islands were unpopulated and unclaimed. Not only this, but the first British civilians made the Falklands their home decades before the nation of Argentina was even born. Nevertheless, with every change of Argentine government, worrying threats of conquest are presented by the incoming regime, in attempts to scoop up support from fanatical and patriotic elements of the Argentinian population.\nBe it Kirchner of the left or a Libertarian like Milei, Argentinian leaders display an obsession with the British territory. Despite not even being a nation when Great Britain obtained the islands, Argentina has continually pressed its claims over the Falklands. The idea of retaking the islands is romantically burned into the minds of many Argentinians. The issue with this attitude is the fact that the islands were never theirs to begin with.\nThe history of the Falklands is an interesting one, but the simplest way of putting it is to state that ownership passed between France, Britain and Spain, sometimes peacefully, sometimes through aggression, with Britain emerging as the eventual occupants. Argentina did briefly seize control of the islands in the 1830s, before British rule was restored. Today, the only nations that could potentially have any semi-legitimate claim to the islands are France and Spain. Both choose not to make such a claim, and recognises Britain’s sovereignty over the Falklands.\nArgentinian claims seem to be based in desperation and hypocrisy. Firstly, they state that the islands should be Argentine due to proximity. By that logic, Alaska should be transferred to Canada. They also state that the Falklands were obtained by Britain during a period of colonial expansion. Yes, this is true, as is the case with almost every single instance of land-expansion by any nation. Would the US now be expected to hand back California, New Mexico and Arizona, among other areas, to Mexico? Should New Caledonia be stripped from France and handed to Australia? Should the Dominican Republic demand that the US hand them Puerto Rico? Should the UK demand that Denmark hand over the Faroe Islands, and should France seize Guernsey from the UK? This list could go on and on. Respect for the status quo is important. Respect for the wishes of local populations is even more important. Lack of respect for either or both matters can only result in anger, anarchy, violence and confusion.\nMoreover, many Argentinians base their claim on the 15th century Treaty of Tordesillas. This was a treaty which arrogantly split the world between Spanish and Portuguese ownership – a treaty ignored and ridiculed by most observers even at the time it was written. Despite the fact no one at the time knew the islands existed, since the treaty placed the area which holds the Falklands in Spanish hands, Argentinian arguments claim that as they are a state born of the Spanish Empire, the Falklands must therefore belong to Argentina. Arguably, the treaty is the most pro-imperial, pro-colonial piece of legislation ever drafted. Nevertheless, we see ‘anti-colonial’ Argentinians, clamouring to accuse Britain of imperialism, hypocritically pointing to it as legitimate legislation backing up their own claim.\nBritish claims, conversely, are based on democracy and logic. Firstly, over 99 percent of the islanders wish to be British, as proven in the recent 2013 referendum. Moreover, any Argentinian overthrow of British rule would then result in a genuine case of colonialism, with a population dominated and governed by an unwelcome foreign power. Secondly, the islands were simply Britain’s before they were ever Argentina’s. This is a very simple but very factual and powerful point.\nIn addition to the points made, it can not be ignored that Argentina did invade the islands in 1982. They started a war which caused the deaths of almost 1000 men from Argentina, the United Kingdom and Nepal. This war resulted in a hard-fought victory for Britain. Hundreds of British military personnel died to defend their soil and their fellow citizens. This act of heroism must always be admired. By even tolerating the notion of relinquishing the islands, this is incredibly disrespectful to those who died fighting to save them. If ever Britain was to hand over the islands, heroes will have died for nothing.\nMoreover, it should not be ignored – though it is rarely mentioned – that the war was not simply a war between two sovereign nations over some islands. It was a war between two completely opposite forms of government and society. On the one hand, the attacking Argentinian contingent was led by an authoritarian military dictatorship, void of democracy and free speech. On the other, the British defenders were representatives of a liberal democracy which promoted tolerance, freedom of expression and the freedom to disagree. Rarely does a war clearly have a ‘good’ and ‘bad’ side. However, despite that fact that Argentina largely conducted itself in a respectable and civilised manner throughout the war, from a political and societal point of view, this conflict could certainly be a contender for such binary descriptions.\nSadly, as the years pass by, more and more people are beginning to forget, or simply stop caring. Even people who lived during the conflict seem to be turning their backs on their fellow countrymen across the globe. We have recently seen this with regards to the surrendering of the Chagos Islands by the recently elected Labour government. By offering up British territory into the hands of a nation which is far from a stable ally of Britain, apparently all so the current government can appear heroic to indignant social media activists, all overseas land is now at risk of being offered up. First, we gave up the Chagos Islands. Already, there is shameful talk of abandoning Gibraltar and its British citizens. How long until the Falklands matter changes from a non-negotiable issue to a debate? How long until we offer them up to Argentina, while simultaneously asking for their forgives for not having done so sooner?\nTherefore, while angry Argentinian voices will often be heard, with erroneous arguments made, British governments and civilians alike have both the honour and the duty of defending the islands, the history of the islands and the islanders themselves. No quarter must ever be given to the angry demands of the illogical fanatics and the already defeated aggressors. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice for the islands. Our responsibility is a much easier one. We need only never forget.",

Second that he purged most (although by no means all) of the lunatics from the opposition front bench. Third, that he is polite and forensic at PMQs. The commentariat rather likes polite and forensic. And fourth, he does not quite seem to actually hate Tories and consider them subhuman. All well and good, then.\nBut none of this is translating into a visible rise in the opinion polls for his party. Indeed, Labour has been polling slightly below the level at which it rested at the end of the 2019 general election campaign, which was not a notable success for the party. In recent polls Labour has been 16-20 percent behind the Tories with some outliers putting the gap at 26 per cent. Much though the commentariat might like him, then, Starmer has not yet revived his party, even slightly, in the mind of the electorate.\nThere are plenty of caveats. These are very strange times and the daily cut and thrust of politics is both absent and an irrelevance to most people. He has not been in the job very long and for obvious reasons not been afforded much of a platform to lay out his vision, if he has one. A recent YouGov poll asked how he was performing as leader and the biggest tranche by a mile was those who answered “don’t know” – 44 per cent. “Don’t know – would you run that name by me again please?” That is only partly down to Starmer.\nBut be all that as it may, is it possible that our elite is once again wrong about the qualities which appeal to ordinary voters? There was a certain populist edge to the Corbyn-McDonnell Party, much of which – on the economic side – was rather attractive to working class voters.\nStarmer is incapable of populism. He’s a conventional, establishment, liberal, centrist. And capable as he may be, I’m not convinced that it is a position from which to win votes.\nA long way to go before the next election, I grant you. But I suspect the commentariat is overstating Starmer’s appeal.\nI think that a lot of people won’t get past the fact that he spent years trying to make Corbyn PM.\nCorbyn would have blown the half a trillion the Tory party scammed via the Covid lie, on national infrastructure.\nObviously, the MSM could never back such logic, when such money can be syphoned off by the well to do.\nCorbyn was also anti-lockdown.\nAs much of a commie as he may be, he would have been better than the last 4 years of Tory communism.\n(Im a Brexit voting, white working class man, who wants low taxes, and the govt to shrink by half, so not a typical Labour voter)\nLabour needs sensible policies as part of a defined strategic approach. Being against everything Conservative is not a strategy; define what good looks like across the country; listen to your traditional base but push hard on values without having to appeal to the wide diaspora of liberalIst ‘ten percenters’. You’re there to govern a nation, not a minority but you will never appeal to everyone.\nAgreed, Had Labour really wanted to make a change, and begin to re-plug the ‘Red Wall’ The obvious option for leader was Andy Burnham… Who’s been doing a terrific job during his time as Mayor of Manchester… Can connect with average voters, And didn’t have any real Corbyn, or indeed Brexit, stink on him.\nI think people like their politics as theatre. He is very dour as are most of his party.\nAs an ex Labour party member I will never again vote for Labour. Many activists left in droves by the shenanigans of MPs and the expulsion of many left wing socialists. The final straw was the sabotage of the last general election 2019 by the 5th columnists MPs and staffers. Starmer is the frontman for Blair, Mandelson and the globalist corporations running the capitalist system.\nAll politicians irrespective of party will do the bidding of the capitalist class yet we continue with this pretence of voting in a system of fake democracy.\nStarmer is as bland as they come basically Asda own brand\nHe looks a bit like Max Headroom\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom\nMax has more charisma\nThese are incredibly dangerous times where the old certainties are collapsing and are not being replaced by anything new and progressive. Covid 19 has helped to push the economy into a deep recession where thousands are already loosing their jobs. The problem is that Starmer belongs to the age of old certainties such as believing that the state can be the saviour of their working class voters. Surely what is needed is a new social contract that involves all sections of society.\nA complete analysis of Next Labour, Rod.\nTheir problem is that the Corbyn/MacDonald years have shown that it’s still a party of one trick ponies. Diane Abbott, David Lammy et al, are hangovers of Benn, Livingstone, Hatton & Skinner, they’re ruled by identity politics.\nBut this has proven to be a divisive issue, as you Rod have many times pointed out.\nDouglas Murray takes it on head on, bringing BAME, race, religion, sexuality & trans into any political argument is based on the “demoralisation of society”.\nThe Lib-Dems are frequently dragged into this virtue signalling & it muddies their convictions. So glad the SDP are still there to take the middle ground.\nthe SDP could be the real opposition to the horror show that is the Johnson/Cummings Government Labour nor the Lib Dems cut it, Johnson doesn’t fear Starmer anymore than He did Corbyn\nI don’t see Labour in Government happening for many Years if ever the Party will not be forgiven for betraying the working class when Blair was Premier, the modern Labour party despises everything British regards People who voted for Brexit as cretins, and holds a contemptuous attitude for aspiration and for curbs on mass immigration, I joined SDP out of protest at the LibLabConSNP regime in Westminster and hope to see the SDP progress as a credible Government and to end the failed continuous Labour Tory Government’s over the last 30 Years\nWhen I see Starmer I always get a picture of Gromit in my mind. He may be the one with the brains but the bumbling, hapless Wallace (Boris) is always the hero.\nI am hoping the SDP offers an alternative to the 3 tired old parties now with Truss replacing Johnson and Starmer’s charismatic bypass of a Personality\nStarmer’s inability to work out what a woman is might cost him the election. This is not just a question about biology. It’s a test of honesty and principles. His cowardice is there for all to se. How many other pressure groups, religions, cults and bullies will he wither in front of for fear of offending of upsetting them. The idea this man has a hand on the reigns of power should terrify all of us.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_an-interview-with-eric-kaufmann/content_280.html": "Eric Kaufmann is professor of politics at Birkbeck College, University of London, and the author of many books including the essential reading ‘Whiteshift’, a profoundly important study of migration’s growing impact on national and ethnic identity, and at the ballot box – not least in generating a schism between those who want to speed up this process of change and those who want to slow it down. He is now working on a similarly well-evidenced book about woke and what he calls its ‘cultural socialism’. Here he speaks with SDPTalks about his thoughts on the future of immigration, multi-culturalism and the trials of academia.\nSDPTALK: Perhaps you could start Eric by outlining the gist of ‘Whiteshift’.\nEK: Basically the argument is that essentially the decline of ethnic majorities in western countries is what underlies the populist vote rise ultimately. The ethnic change of the majority becoming the minority is going to be reached roughly mid-century in the US, New Zealand and by the end of the century in western European countries and that will frame the politics [such that] the old economic left/right will be reduced in its importance for partisanship and political competition. And then the question of where we see the ethnic majorities going and that involves assimilation and increasingly mixed, poly-genetic populations that I argue will gravitate to the myths, symbols and narratives of the existing majority groups. That’s the very broad argument.\nSDPTALK: How does this discussion deal with the inevitable charge of racism, which tends to come up whatever the topic of immigration is raised?\nEK: Ultimately this is about a country’s ethnic composition and not wanting that to shift as quickly [as it might], and the left and even some liberals disingenuously will try to call that racism. But there’s an important distinction between an attachment to and a dislike of backed very clearly by the psychological literature – that if a white person feels warmly towards white people it doesn’t mean they feel cooler to black people, for example. The left will elide that attachment to and dislike of though it’s clear that’s not the case. And this is about attachment to in the most part. To talk about racism is appropriate if you’re talking about race purity or an ethno-state or second-class citizenship and so on and then the charge would be fair. But this is about saying there are people who want things to be conserved and not change quickly. Again the left frames that as ‘if you want this, then you’re racist’. The other thing is that there’s an important distinction between the way you treat your citizens inside your country and who you select for membership. If the Catholic Church only accepts Catholics does that make it bigoted? Philosophically the the principle of free association – and the right to disaffiliate – is accepted. So in terms of immigrant selection that’s not the same thing as treating citizens within your country differently on the basis of some characteristic. Again, saying that you want to maintain what I call the ethno-traditional [the ethnic majority’s historic culture etc] – which a lot of minorities support because it’s what they know and have grown up with – is different to saying you have to be white to be British, which again I think would fall under the definition of racism. But these are subtle things that are hard to have a conversation about without someone shrieking at you.\nSDPTALK: The immigration debate often throws up concerns about its impact on jobs, services and so on. Is this a smokescreen that stops us saying what the real issue is?\nEK: Yes there’s this deflection towards these economic dimensions that aren’t properly correlated. Obviously logically if the problem is pressure on public services the part accounted for by immigrants is going to be a smaller problem than the total pressure. We develop our views on immigration for cultural or psychological reasons and then interpret that as a problem – the pressure on public services – through that lens. But that pressure isn’t the real driver of restrictionist sentiment. All the literature suggests that whether you’ve just lost your job, rich or poor, whatever your class, none of this really shapes your views on immigration. The deeper psychological reasons are vastly more important.\nSDPTALK: The recent Home Office decision to offshore illegal immigrants for processing in Rwanda has not been without controversy. In ‘Whiteshift’ you outline your own proposal for effective refugee centres.\nEK: The idea is that there needs to be a clear distinction between refuge and safety on the one hand and permanent settlement on the other. Right now the two are sandwiched together such that if you want to take a refugee you have them for life. And there’s no real capacity for people to go home if a conflict ends, for example. And all this given there’s no real way to adjudicate on whether someone is a genuine or fake refugee. Of course the legal apparatus has been skewed by activism more or less towards not deporting anybody too. I think that leads to countries rejecting genuine refugees. My preferred option is to have more or less enclosed detention centres within western and other countries closer to the conflict, where people are free to come and go as they want, and there’s a system of revenue sharing to fund the camps. And if people feel it’s safe to go back [home] that’s their decision. It’s not up to some judicial office. So you’re offering safety, health, education and so on, but not the prospect of permanent settlement. Offshoring the issue as we have it now is effectively doing the same thing but in ways more problematic, handled as it is by countries that don’t have the best records. I understand people coming [to western countries] for more opportunistic reasons but I believe in incentivisation and if it’s possible to get in just by getting a toe on shore you’re only going to get more and more people until, as in Australia, it blows up into a political situation.\nSDPTALK: There’s one particular line in ‘Whiteshift’ that stood out to me and that’s “expressing racism is more acceptable than expressing racial self-interest”. Could you expand on that?\nEK: Yeah, so the point there is that because people aren’t more or less allowed to say they’re discomforted by the pace of change affecting the race they’re attached to, to the mix of groups that they knew, instead of being able to express that as a legitimate ethnic attachment, these ethno-traditional concerns have to be sublimated into other forms of expression – [perhaps] one stance is to become very concerned about rights and therefore be anti-Muslim ‘because Muslims are bad for toleration’. A much healthier conversation I think is not to stigmatise an out group but to be able to express being attached to our own group. To some degree the stigmatisation comes from not being able to have that conversation.\nSDPTALK: Is that why, in seems, it’s not considered OK for white majorities to laud their own culture while minorities are encouraged to do so?\nEK: That’s what I call asymmetric multi-culturalism and dates to the 1910s even, and the cultural left being in revolt against their own culture and therefore valuing minority cultures – not wanting them to assimilate but simultaneously wanting their own culture to be superseded by cosmopolitanism. The [early modernist] critique made was that the majority culture was boring and not very expressive while the minority culture was exotic, and later, from the 60s on, the leftist critique was that it was about oppression. So expressing a majority or white identity came to be seen as racist or taboo. Of course because the relative homogeneity of most countries prior to the 60s explicit ethnic majority identity wasn’t necessary in some ways. If you said you were, say, French or British the ethic and the civic aspect of identity were so integrated you didn’t know you were expressing ethnicity. That changed with the identification of minorities.\nSDPTALK: Is the idea of multiculturalism over now?\nEK: It may have gone in terms of electoral winnability but it’s still pretty much a dominant paradigm in academia. That hasn’t receded [with its failures] so much as academics moving the goal-posts and saying ‘ah well ,that’s not real multi-culturalism..’. But I think we’ve seen that if [a way of thinking like multi-culturalism] isn’t seen as a vote-winner, parties quickly move away from it, as Labour did [with multi-culturalism]. And now I think some of the woke stuff may quickly become toxic for Labour and the Democrats in the US. The Republicans are much more courageous taking this on and will force the Democrats on the defensive, whereas the Tories are chicken and so the issues will be kept off the agenda and the left will continue to get away with these things and Labour won’t have to address them and so won’t pay a penalty for backing [some of these ideas]. But Democrats have already had to find some realism and back away from the likes of ‘defund the police’. Yet none of this is to say that academia will change. It’s going to take repeated drubbing, repeated Trump-like victories, to bring change that might percolate down into intellectual culture.\nSDPTALK: Do you ever feel marginalised in academia for your work on these often touchy topics?\nEK: Oh yeah I’ve been an absolute pariah amongst 50% of the social sciences people who are aware of what I’ve written. It’s not a tolerant environment. That said, there are more shades of opinion in academia than might be apparent from the outside and the liberal tradition is aware that there’s a problem with campus culture and don’t really like it – they are a bit embarrassed by the cancellations and other stuff that’s happening – though it’s more oriented towards the right wing as the main threat. But certainly anything around the validity of white identity, they’d all be signed up to the taboo on those things. On the moderate stuff they’re more free speechy, but much less attracted to defending things like the idea of Britain not being racist. There’s not much collegiality [in my place of work] – and that’s a good thing. But there’s still that awkwardness that people know that other people are after you, cancel campaigns, internal investigations and so on, so there’s definitely pressure and attempts to censor. It’s all part and parcel of being an academic that takes the kind of stance that I do.\nEnds\nThe Social Democratic Party must offer an alternative to the Labour and Conservative parties it’s becoming more and more Apparent that neither party offers real change anymore as they’re part of the problem not the solution, We deserve much better than Starmer and the jury is still out on Truss, I have regularly mentioned to my family and friends about the SDP and have had letters published in my local and National newspapers about giving the SDP a look I myself am appalled at the tired old Liblabconsnpgreen thanks for the excellent interview with Eric Kaufman\nAs a member of the Social Democratic Party since 2020 I hope the Party reaches out to disillusioned voters from the Liblabconsnp parties We deserve better than Truss and Starmer",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2019_03_12_a-party-for-the-politically-homeless/content_683.html": "This article by Giles Fraser was recently published on the UNHERD website.\nA party for the politically homeless\nThe SDP’s new pro-community, pro-Brexit manifesto is for the ‘Somewheres’\nGiles Fraser\nIt feels like I have just met a ghost. “This book bears a disconcerting resemblance to a biography of someone who showed early promise but died young”, so begins Ivor Crew and Anthony King’s doorstopper of a book on the SDP (a snip at £76). I too thought the SDP were dead. Dead, buried and ancient history. Monty Python parrot dead. But here’s the thing. A tall man in a neat dark blue suit has just walked into a trendy Soho brassiere and handed me his card. It bears the familiar (now retro looking) SDP logo on it. William Clouston, it reads. Party Leader. And he looks like flesh and blood to me.\nRemember the heady days of 1981? You may not, of course. Formed as a break-away from the Labour party at a time when Labour was being infiltrated by the hard left of Militant, and when the party itself was led by an allegedly incompetent, scruffy and equally hard-left leader, Michael Foot, (the comparison with today’s situation is easily made) the SDP burst onto the political scene with unprecedented enthusiasm and success.\nEighty thousand people joined up that year. 28 Labour MP’s defected. By the end of the year a Gallup poll had an alliance of the SDP and the Liberal Party running at over 50% support among voters. “Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government” the Liberal leader, David Steel, told his party conference.\nBut it was not to be. Two years after the SDP was founded, in 1983, the SDP/Liberal alliance contested its first general election. It won 25% of the vote and gained just 23 seats, only 6 of which were SDP. Something similar happened in the 1987 election, and a year later most of the SDP decided to merge with the Liberals creating the Liberal Democrats. A few under David Owen resisted the merger, but less than a decade after the SDP was formed, its leadership threw in the towel.\nWilliam Clouston sips his tea and explains to me how, then, the SDP is still alive. There were those who kept the faith at local level, he explains, small groups and a handful of local councillors in places like Glasgow, Port Talbot and East Yorkshire. But most people forgot about them.\nThen last November, something curious happened. Signs of life began to re-appear. The UKIP MEP Patrick O’Flynn quit his party because of its links with Tommy Robinson and joined the SDP. In the same month, the SDP published a New Declaration, written mostly by Cloulston. It is a communitarian, pro-Brexit, social democratic manifesto very much in the style of Maurice Glassman’s Blue Labour – a political manifesto aimed at David Goodhart’s ‘Somewheres’. And about as far away from the liberal ‘Anywheres’ as it is possible to imagine.\nBack in the 80’s, I remember thinking that the debates between the Owenite faction of the SDP and the Liberals was all a bit People’s Front of Judea vs the Judean People’s Front – that is, a narcissism of small differences. But it wasn’t.\nDavid Owen has long been a passionate pro-European. Indeed, he was one of the Labour rebels who voted with Heath to take Britain into the EU. But Owen was always more nuanced in his appreciation of the European Union, resisting its continual expansion. In 1989, the Owenite branch of the party, at their party conference, ruled out a united states of Europe. And the SDP has been tacking in a Eurosceptic direction the more the EU has sought to aggregate new powers to itself. In February 2016, Owen himself came out as a Brexiteer.\nAnd now, for the first time in years, people are joining up again. There are green shoots of Twitter activity and a few more local meetings. But it still has the feeling of something worthy about it.\nFor those who have been a part of keeping the faith alive, meeting in chilly church halls, it feels a little like some survivalist protestant sect. And Clouston – softly spoken, kindly face – has just a touch of the local vicar about him. He would be the sort of vicar who has made a few quid in a previous career, and now wants to settle down to do good works. His father was an original SDP convert from Labour in 1981, and the SDP was passed down, father to son.\nIt is the New Declaration that has awoken this renewed interest. Clouston explains that it is a “love letter to people who think like us who don’t have a political home.” Culturally, they will appeal to natural Conservatives – pro-family, pro-community, and patriotic. And yet they resist the neo-liberal model of economics that has devastated traditional working-class communities, especially in the North and the Midlands.\n“Free from vested interests” the New Declaration begins “the SDP seeks the common good in Britain’s national interest. We represent neither capital nor labour, not private interest nor the public sector, but only the welfare of the British people and residents of these islands.” Later it states: “the power of the market has over-reached, fraying the social bonds that bind us together.”\nOn Brexit, the Declaration is equally trenchant. “First and foremost we are democrats. The scale and vehemence of the reaction against the result of the 2016 referendum by Britain’s cultural and political elites was striking. The evident distain of the Westminster class for, among others, many elderly and low income voters revealed that the powerful only tolerate democracy when their view prevails”.\nSo the SDP are not just a little bit different from liberals, ideologically, they are the liberals’ sworn enemies. “Liberalism is all about the individual and we have had enough of that,” explains Clouston. “The antagonism is very deep.”\nBut it’s not just the association with the Liberal Democrats that confuses potential supporters. The new look SDP now faces another potential point of confusion: their association with former UKIPers.\nThis week Patrick O’Flynn was selected as the SDP candidate for Peterborough, in the expectation of a by-election. Clouston supports this selection, explaining that O’Flynn had his MEP constituency office in Peterborough and retains a lot of support there.\nKeen to push me off the UKIP line of questioning, Clouston explains that the majority of those now joining the SDP are either from the Labour party or those who have politically been of no fixed abode. I explain to him that I think UKIP is electoral kryptonite to middle ground voters. Clearly not a natural poker player, Clouston’s face shows signs of discomfort. The SDP are in a bind – O’Flynn brings them some much needed name recognition. But they really don’t want to be seen as the party for UKIP dropouts.\nWill the SDP do well? Probably not. History is against them – even though the Labour parties’ current leadership means that the stars look similarly aligned to what they were in 1981. First part the post will always block the emergence of new parties. Theirs would be the finest comeback since Lazarus (to borrow that great phrase from darts commentator Sid Waddell).\nBut, in terms of political philosophy, they are still the most interesting thing to emerge in British politics for a long while. And, so unlike the professional political class that dominate the Westminster bubble, there will be many who will warm to Clouston’s open manner. Living in Corbridge, Northumberland, hundreds of miles away from the political bubble, the dog-walking chap-next-door hasn’t been bashed into shape by spin doctors.\nPersonally, I wish him well. The New Declaration – getting their basic position right – was a terrific start. But that was the easy bit. Now they have to grow the party. And not ruin what they have already achieved as they once again emerge into the light.\nThe article can be found here",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_write-for-sdptalk/content_168.html": "Since launching in April 2020, SDPTalk has grown to an insightful, adventurous, and thoughtful outlet covering the state and future of social democracy and British society. Featuring contributions from both within the SDP and friends of the party, SDPTalk is always on the look for new articles that may be of interest to our members and readership\nOur articles aim to appeal to not just our membership, but any curious and non-partisan member of the public. We aim for our articles to be interesting and readable, ideally exploring a complex or challenging issue that will connect with our readers.\nSDPTalk does not merely exist to raise the profile of the SDP. We believe in publishing high-quality writing that stimulates and inspires our membership, and seeds new ideas both within the party and beyond. Like the best outlets, we aim to develop a consistent and solid editorial reputation that our readers can come to trust: we aim to be a platform that readers will regularly return to.\nTopics\nThere are three types of content we typically publish. In general, any one of articles tends to be some mix of these:\n- Political and Social Analysis: These pieces explore a trend, a major piece of news, or some other fact of British social and political life. In these pieces, authors dig into details and often offer an insight into why something is happening.\n- Philosophy and Ideology: Building on the groundwork set by the New Declaration, these pieces explore ideas about why and how society should be structured. In these pieces, an author draws off philosophy, developments that challenge our existing ideas, and their own intuitions and experience.\n- Policy and Proposals: Building off the SDP’s existing policy set, these pieces explore policies that can improve our society. In these pieces, an author investigates how a policy proposal can alleviate a problem and explores how such a policy could be implemented.\nForm, Tone, Style\nTypically our articles are 500-1,000 words in length, although we may consider articles of up to 1,500 words if they’re sufficiently high quality and their length is justified.\nArticles should have a clear thesis running throughout, with a strong and interesting hook at the beginning and every paragraph serving the piece’s central argument. Logical flow and a strong narrative are essential, along with the piece being crisp and engaging.\nIf possible, hyperlink sources. If not, then provide citations on authors and book names inline.\nHow to pitch\nIf you’re interested in writing for us, send a pitch to the SDPTalk editorial team at: sdptalk@sdp.org.uk\nYour pitch should be a 100-200 word synopsis of your piece, followed by anything we should know about you. Explain what it is you’re arguing, and any intermediate points you’ll make to demonstrate your argument.\nWe aim to respond to all pitches within a week of receipt. If your pitch is accepted, we’ll share any relevant deadlines or editorial steers with you.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_wayne-dixon-the-sdps-leeds-council-hopeful/content_265.html": "Wayne Dixon is the leader of the SDP’s Yorkshire campaigning base and is challenging strongly for a seat on Leeds City Council.\nRooted in the community, his campaigning background comes from running a football club in Leeds. Founded by Wayne in 2004, Middleton Park F.C now has more than 200 members.\nWayne says of starting it up,\n“It was just to get the kids off the street on my estate, because there was nothing to do. Football clubs, rugby clubs, cricket clubs, they are massive to communities. I think they’re really undervalued, and it’s great for local community networking – I’ve seen some of the juniors getting jobs because people know them [through the club].”\nThis was also how he got his first taste of how political power in Leeds works. For when he lobbied Leeds City Council for some minimal support for the club – just sharing training facilities – he came face to face with official indifference.\n“The council is just so short-sighted. One of the local councillors told me I didn’t know what I was doing – that was after running [the club] for 10 years. They kept banging on about us being self-sustainable, but when I asked for the tools to help make us self-sustainable, they wouldn’t do it.”\nEventually, with a group of other community clubs, he put together a plan to use a former golf club. However this was ignored by the council.\n“They didn’t even ring me to explain. So I decided to stand for the council,” he says.\nWith some votes behind him and the prospect of his tally rising, councillors became much more amenable: “How can we help you, Wayne?”\nThe process of getting involved taught Wayne how the system works. Or rather, how it doesn’t work: “That’s what got me into politics: they promised the world and just didn’t deliver.”\nRegardless, Middleton Park F.C has mushroomed in popularity – and one of its players has just graduated to sign for Sheffield United.\nFor Dixon, this story demonstrates the same thing that has driven radical leaders in Yorkshire over the centuries: how our political settlement keeps disadvantaged communities disadvantaged. He wants that to change.\nHe asks,\n“Why don’t people on council estates get involved in politics? One of the biggest barriers is some people not knowing much about the electoral system. Straightaway at schools we’ve got a failure to educate us on how our country works. But also, it costs money. It’s not just money on leaflets, but also fuel costs and those kinds of things. If you are struggling financially why would you do that?\nWhen people don’t understand the electoral system, they just don’t vote – so they end up with someone who hasn’t done anything for them in decades, and who nine times out of ten doesn’t live in the area and a lot of time doesn’t even go to the area. So there’s no representation as such. All there is is someone appointed to your area from a political party, be it Labour or Conservative. If you’re not from a community, or at least live there, how can you understand that place?”\nLocal elections in Wayne’s ward are due next May.\nThe SDP is hopeful that Wayne will unseat Judith Blake, the Labour leader of Leeds City Council, in Middleton Park ward. “She lives 45 minutes drive away, and we never see her,” he says. However she survives on a turnout of 22 percent.\nUnseating Blake would be a huge moment for Wayne and for the SDP, but would also bring focus onto issues and policies.\nSome of the SDP’s policy ideas will be small and relatively uncontroversial, such as allowing local sports clubs to lease their own grounds. “It sounds small but it’ll be massive, because clubs will be able to get so much more funding to build on their facilities, and they’ll have incentive to make it more of a community club.”\nSome will be more contentious, including the SDP’s stand against positive discrimination.\n“For me it’s about equality, genuine equality: treating everyone the same, not just picking and choosing. People should think about a person’s situation rather than just race. You won’t bring all of us together by discriminating for and against people because of their skin colour. That’s wrong. Things like police recruitment have to be fair.\nI get why they do it, because they want to present an idealistic view of the country, but when you’re looking at kids off the estate like mine, they hate the police, but they’re the ones they’re wanting in some respects. If you want build respect, you’ve got to get people from all backgrounds.\nThe good thing about the SDP is that we cross across the right-left wing divide – everyone can find good in us. It’s not racist to be genuinely concerned about immigration. People around here are concerned that their family members can’t get a council house because there’s a shortage. The council will prioritize housing for those who are most in need, but those who meet this test tend to be new to the country. So obviously the council gives them priority – it’s a bit of a catch-22.”\nWayne is now using the same organizational drive and talent which he brought to the football club to help build the SDP organisation in Yorkshire. The party has the same focus on building communities and supporting families that he has demonstrated.\n“[Middleton] has a rough reputation, but as funny as it sounds, my neighbours were probably the most trustworthy people I’ve met. Sounds really daft, but as kids you could leave your house door open, and no-one’s going to walk in. The mentality on the council estate was looking after their own, so that’s what they do.\n“You don’t have to have financial stability or be rich to have a good community spirit where everyone looks after each other. That’s what we hope to build in the SDP.”\ngood luck get rid of Labour\nGood for you Wayne.\nThe last ward election for Middleton Park Ward (20190 Labour won with less than 10% support of the electorate.\nTurnout of 22% (sadly typical for most of the country for parish/town/council elections) just hands it to the entrenched candidate.\nTurn out is key. If you can increase turnout – Labour is toast.\nGood luck.\np.s. Can you amend this post to show the actual date of the election?\nWayne’s is an example to the rest of the SDP. Without this sort of approach the SDP will not develop as an organic party, of the people and for the people. Campaigning needs to be the lifeblood of the SDP and thankfully is beginning to take if in some regions.\nRoger Hill, Chairman SDP.\nAn inspiring article. If you are prepared to build from the ground up and work for your community then you will succeed.\nIt sounds like Labour is there for the taking.\nGood luck.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_a-localist-model-for-higher-education/content_512.html": "Since the 1990s, the higher education sector has ballooned at the expense of technical and craft skills training. The model which has been taken for granted – of specialised, residential, collegiate, academic training taking place away from home – was based on an assumption of spatial and social mobility.\nChildren of just eighteen leave the places where they grew up, often never to return for any length of time. This weakens their aesthetic and affective attachments to these places; dissolving entanglements of mutual reciprocation in the community; undermining the habits of cohabitation, mutual care and understanding between inter-dependent adults in nuclear and even extended families.\nWhatever purpose this model may once have served, it has become an enormous and wasteful burden on public finances. The over-expansion of putative academic subjects and frameworks has undermined the status and resources directed towards technical and craft skills. Grade inflation (an enormous distorting incentive for institutional expansion), the proliferation of self-serving and self-regulating grievance disciplines like Gender and Postcolonial Studies, and the imposition of poorly-taught, fashionable nonsense on students who often don’t acquire the most basic academic skills, have produced an appearance of academic education that often produces very little by way of useful knowledge and very few skills.\nThis model is about to collapse under the pressure of three forces. Economic contraction and geo-political tensions with China will likely reduce the lucrative flow of overseas students to a trickle. At the same time, the disruption of the residential model and the rapid delivery of online courses is pulling away the Emperor’s robe, revealing the reality that many courses and institutions are offering very little value.\nA whole generation is beginning to see the cost/benefits of the traditional model in a new light. At the same time, entering a period of permanent economic stagnation and fiscal crisis, with an aging population and a growing crisis of care, the health and welfare systems will be under unprecedented pressure. In such a context, communities and extended families will be forced, once again, to pick to some of the burden. Finally, in a post-pandemic political economy there is much to be said for an education and training system that facilitates the risk-taking, backyard entrepreneurialism, garden shed inventers and free-booting technical innovation that will drive the incipient 4th industrial revolution – technical change based on ubiquitous information economy, 3D Printing and other developments in micro-fabrication that are making possible a low-overhead, highly distributed circular economy.\nWith such drivers in mind, a pre-emptive restructuring of British higher education could start from the following principles.\n- Education should embrace the reality and necessity of a society in which individual rights are tied to structures of mutual obligations, and in which individuals are enmeshed in place-centred relationships of interdependency (rather than contracts) extending over time. Such relationships with individuals (as in marriage), groups (family, church), communities, interest-based associations, will reduce social and spatial mobility but increase cohesion, security and availability of reciprocal care.\n- The ‘away from home’ residential model should be reserved for higher-level and meritocratic and elite-level institutions (e.g. the much smaller flow of PhDs in the social sciences and humanities).\n- The reduction in the number of people doing fully academic training should be matched by an increase in quality, standards and thresholds for entry.\n- An increase in the quality of training and opportunities for hands-on experience in technical and craft areas, especially in burgeoning domains associated with electronics, computing, the Internet of Things, micro-industrial/fabrication technologies (in areas such as additive manufacturing, bioscience etc).\nOn this basis, points of departure for an H.E. strategy would involve first of all, a large reduction in the number of university institutions, together with abolishing subsidies for ‘grievance’ disciplines that train students as political activists, versed in dodgy ideologies. Second-tier institutions would revert to a focus on craft and technical training with colleges acting also as tool-libraries, innovation accelerators and industrial resource centres, also serving as hubs for re-emerging forms of guild organizations.\nWith the proliferation of online resources beyond the STEM disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the typical degree will shift to a model of extended adult-education, self-study and periodic residential retreats. To counteract grade inflation, assessment will shift entirely back to rigorous anonymous final examination (in some cases managed by guilds). Finally, maintenance subsidies would be largely phased out with the expectation that students would, for the most part, live at home. The rationale for this change is not primarily expense, but the re-consolidation of the relational rather than contractual basis of civil society.\nIn the emerging milieu, policy will be driven by the contradictory imperatives of fiscal austerity, social cohesion, the need to increase the rate of innovation, reindustrialization and the re-localization of production chains. The goal would be for smaller, more rooted and place-attached universities and technical colleges to become the beating heart and centre of revived city-regional economies.\nThis would be reflected in a renewed emphasis on procession, public affirmation, rites of passage – not only with regard the award of degrees, but guild membership, public holidays and street parties, (possibly) compulsory local service, relationships with local hospitals and schools and relationships with the local food and farming sectors. Rather than the transience of mobile individuals, localist higher education would instead dramatise the vivid, experiential and lived fabric of relationships reaching into every home, business, garden shed, allotment society and church, mosque and temple.\nLooks like the over expansion of university education is starting to happen as it has recently been reported that eleven institutions are on the verge of bankruptcy. No surprise here when the whole educational rational of only having as legitimate university degrees when in fact what is required is an expansion in apprenticeships. This mat tackle the problem of generational selfishness which refuses to see that adults have responsibiliteies as well as rights.\n“self-serving and self-regulating grievance disciplines like Gender and Postcolonial Studies”. This article, along with that in the Progressive review on ‘shimmy-ing’ reads like an updated: Travail, Famille, Patrie – though now it’s a local state, and travail is 3-d printing in sheds. And once we get those activist-training, dog disciplines out of the way, filling those kids’ head with all that nonsense, we’ll be well on our way.\nIndeed – that’s a little snide but fair summary 🙂 – at least of the point of departure\nFantastic article. We need ideas like this embedded in a real political movement. How do we do that?\nWholeheartedly agree with the thrust of this article.\nAside from those studying STEM subjects, or the more rigorously academic courses, society really doesn’t benefit from most graduates entering the work force at all – unless you believe that what the UK needs is an ever swelling cadre of Diversity-and-Inclusion Officers, HR managers and professional activists.\nAs armies of teenagers, fresh from several years of instruction at the hands of marxist teaching unions, march into universities to study from a de-colonised syllabus, (to be taught by academics, 80% of whom identify as being left or very left wing) and are enjoined to worship false idols like St Greta, the end-times-prophet Hobbit, and believe that our history is only something we should feel guilty for.\nThankfully, plenty of these students will have the sense and the spirit to push back against this indoctrination – but plenty won’t – and so we find our heritage and culture threatened by this woke Taliban, these Children of the Quorn.\nThe drive to push half of all young people into universities has done no one any good. Not the universities, not the more academic students, nor the less academic, not the employers and certainly not the country as a whole. (Indeed the only beneficiaries seem to have been vastly over-remunerated University vice-Chancellors).\nTruly, is there ANY innovation of the Blair / Brown Govt’s that actually proved a benefit to the country?\nI know ‘Elite’ is now universally applied as a pejorative, but that seems daft in the context of higher education. Universities should be elite institutions, attracting the brightest and the best, and pushing them to fulfil their potential. If we returned to that model – say 10% to 15% of each generation attending university – then the taxpayer could afford to remove tuition fees, and the University’s finances could be re-focused. Earning a degree would then actually mean something again.\nUniversities are not a “business”, and trying to run them as such has been to their detriment – both academically and financially.\nInstead we have seen successive governments pushing to get as many students as possible into universities just as a stated goal without thinking through the unintended, though wholly predictable, consequences. So now we have huge numbers going to university, piling up substantial personal debt, studying non-academic courses that will not lead them into research or academia nor even benefit them in the jobs-market. No wonder we’ve seen reports of graduates looking to sue their alma mater. Under the current system they paid handsomely for a “product” that didn’t live up to its advertised worth.\nIn the past, those people who went into Further Education – rather than Higher Education – would have gained the benefits through colleges or polys without being saddled with £40k – 50k worth of debt for a degree that, given the saturation of the “graduate” jobs market, means little more than a decent set of A-level results would have done 20 years ago. The trouble is, in this country, the idea of HE and FE is the U and Non-U of the C21st.\nThe current model needs to change but there have been painfully few politicians, of any stripe, with the sense or courage to point out that rather obvious fact.\n(Steve, as I say, I agree with all you’ve written, but my inner pedant feels compelled to pull you up on one thing: You write, “…the disruption of the residential model and the rapid delivery of online courses is pulling away the Emperor’s robe, revealing the reality that many courses and institutions are offering very little value..”\nThere’s no need to pull away the Emperor’s Robe, the point is it isn’t there. Did you perhaps mean pulling back the curtain to reveal the mundanity of the Wizard of Oz? )",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_living-together-a-story-of-community-and-loss/content_29.html": "The Government promises a massive house-building programme, yet there’s little mention of how to build communities. I don’t mean the specious so-called communities of BAME-this or trans-that. I mean the real ones, where neighbours of every kind look out for one another, share a sense of home, and show it by their actions.\nModernity does little to nurture communities, more often leaving the fabric of neighbourliness in tatters. Attempts to preserve or renew a communitarian culture come and go, most invariably ending in failure. Money is thrown at the problem. However, ultimately idealists perhaps pay the highest price, in disillusionment. Two such idealists are Jan and Mike Davis.\nWhere London meets Essex, on the Havering council estate where they’ve lived for 30 years, the Davises run the Petra Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). TMOs give social housing tenants and leaseholders a chance to take on responsibility for managing their own estates. A TMO enters into a legal agreement with its landlord and is paid annual management and maintenance allowances in order to carry out its duties. Grassroots democracy begins here.\nThe Davises have been at the helm since Petra’s inception in 2003, taking it in turns to be chair, steering a small staff team and variably attentive committee through the day-to-day challenges of managing an estate of 150 households.\nAn elderly couple, old school ex-Labour councillors and divorcees both, they met in the chamber of Havering Council. Community activists to their bones, these comrades became soulmates, and their thoughts turned to making a home together. Naturally for the Davises this home-making extended beyond their own cosy flat to the Parkhill Estate as a whole.\nSome may be unaware of the fact, but Parkhill residents have benefited greatly from the Davises commitment to community. It’s no coincidence the estate and its grounds are among the best maintained and least crime-affected in the borough, with many former tenants taking the opportunity to become leaseholders.\nBut now in their 70s, fed up with the lack of support, and with health problems mounting, they have decided to retire. Properly this time, even perhaps moving away from the estate. Perfectly understandable decisions these, of course, but there’s a problem. No one in the community appears remotely interested in, or capable of, filling their shoes.\nIf social reconciliation is the essential task of democratic politics for the next generation, how is it to be achieved when even a couple as capable and committed as the Davises cannot stir that civic spirit into life?\nWe can’t, as Bertolt Brecht once fantasized doing, dismiss the people and appoint new ones. We have to work with what we’ve got: an increasingly fragmented, poorly-informed, easily-distracted miscellany of ‘world citizens’ largely oblivious to history and what it took to achieve all that we have in this country.\nWe social democrats talk about a ‘values and virtues-led cultural renewal’ because we know how fundamental – how radical – the change needs to be. All must play their part, from grassroots to government, the latter reshaping our institutions and democratic structures to stimulate interest and effective participation from below.\nCommon-good constitutionalism would be a great place to start. It’s why the SDP supports electoral reform, the creation of an English parliament, the abolition of the House of Lords, and increased powers for local councils and backbench MPs.\nBut an even greater challenge is the one the SDP must tackle from here at base camp all the way through to that electoral Everest of a summit we intend to scale one day – that of successfully nesting common-good ideas in the hearts and minds of the British people.\nThe fate of the Parkhill Estate hangs in the balance. Will all that Jan and Mike have achieved over the years be lost, their former home becoming just another sink estate? Or will, at the eleventh hour, their example inspire others to step up, shoulder responsibility, and help themselves to a brighter, shared future?\nA really great blog post! The word community has been misappropriated for far too long. We as communitarians are instead preoccupied with how to achieve it’s true meaning- A group of individuals who place the ideal of the community at the heart of their actions. SDP is the only political contender bringing such important questions to the forefront of British politics.\nSo much sense spoken by the SDP on so many issues. The problem is hardly anyone knows the party exists. I might be out of order but the party needs to find a way to get greater exposure. A big backer with financial clout would be most welcome. So many people I see speak to echo the sentiments of the SDP but always say we need a new party to speak for us blissfully unaware that this party already exists.\nWe need to get rid of the Tories and keep out Labour as well\nGreat article that emphasises how far the deterioration of civic responsibility has gone. The aim of the SDP must be to somehow counter the dominant idea of celebrity culture that all young people seem to aspire to.\nI live in Havering and I have heard of there charitable activities I wish them well We need an alternative to the rotten Tories & Labour ineptness\nPicking up on your “common good constitutionalism would be a great place to start. Its why the SDP support electoral reform”. The trouble is the electoral reform the SDP support doesn’t have a sense of purpose. It doesn’t show what it will achieve or how it will achieve it. It will not lead to common good ideas being nurtured.\nWe should reform the House of Lords and not abolish it. We should turn it into an unelected revising chamber which represents all the institutions operating in our society. It cant be an elected chamber as democracy cant be doubled but it can be split.\nWealth and power will always have its say. So if we create a conduit for their influence directly into the legislative process. They will spend less time, effort and money subverting the democratically elected House of Commons.\nPolitical parties should only be allowed to campaign and get elected to one tier of government. They must choose from local, national or UK Government. Party loyalty can affect all levels of government when prioritising the needs of their party ahead of their elected duties. There are many people either elected or who want to be elected as a councillor who campaign intensively during a General Election, not to get elected themselves but to establish or consolidate their position in the local party. This is one way in which established parties prevent smaller parties and independent candidates from gaining a foot hold in Westminster. Thus insuring that British politics continues to stagnate.\nWe need to reduce the impact that national campaigns have in a General Election. We need to force the integration of the national campaign into the local campaigns and not vice versa. The national campaigns should not have their own expense allowance. Each constituency should still have its own expense allowance plus an additional allowance that it can spend on the national campaign. When the national campaign comes to that constituency and when that allowance is used in that constituency. This should prevent the established parties from using their safe seats to subsidise their campaigns in their target and marginal seats.\nParty political broadcasts should be ended as they further entrench the established parties. Broadcasters and publishers who cover the election shouldn’t just offer equal coverage; they should actively seek and enable equal coverage. This should be done a constituency level. So that when a national campaign rolls into a constituency the independent candidates get as much coverage as the national campaigns and their local candidate combined.\nThis article demonstrates how much can be done for communities with committed individuals taking the lead. It is very sad that nobody wants to take on the responsibilities, but sadly is typical of a modern malaise where people want this that and the other but are not prepared to get involved. From the SDP point of view, grass roots involvement in community organisations presents the opportunity to start a ground up movement to get councillors elected and eventually MPs.",

One such intrusion coming down the road at speed is, I believe, a Central Bank Digital Currency.\nMuch talk has been made of a cashless society and the latest trends suggest that a very large proportion of people in the UK already use credit cards and phone wallet payments as a normal way of paying for goods and services. A large section of us already have online banking facilities and think nothing of going out without any cash in our pockets knowing we can easily access our accounts to keep track of all those expenses.\nNo doubt if HMRC had its way we would be compelled to carry out all transactions in just such traceable ways. And if banks have their way, cash – a perfectly legal way of tender – may soon come to an end, as strange as that idea may sound. You’ll have noticed the disappearing bank branches have been followed by disappearing ATMs. Other nations are considerably further down this road already.\nBut let’s consider how today’s system works when we buy something. We offer our card to the cashier and the electronic transfer of funds is registered with the card issuing bank. All that has happened is an electronic check with the bank to ascertain your ability to pay by that means.\nNo one knows what you have purchased other than a record of the supplier’s name and the amount you spent and at the end of each day all those millions of transactions are reconciled by all the parties involved. It is a clearing operation that has gone on in one form or another since banks came into being.\nSo far so good. But then comes a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), if the kind being explored by a join Bank of England/HM Treasury taskforce comes into force.\nThis is different from privately-issued cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Instead, it would be a form of electronic (digitized) money issued by the Bank of England that could be used by households and businesses to make everyday payments – in essence a ‘digital banknote’. Over 90 central banks are currently exploring CBDCs too.\nIt will be argued that just as cheques have mainly had their day and cash isn’t far behind the need to further simplify payments is the way to go.\nYet the new way seems to depend on the Central Bank, The Bank of England, creating a system that will in effect render all the many individual banks semi-obsolete, even though they will still exist to act as agencies for the Bank of England. Of course, we will be assured that the commercial private banks will continue to operate in conjunction with the Bank of England but one suspects that will only be for a limited time.\nIt will mean that the existing system of anonymity will go and each and every transaction will be identifiable back to that individual or entity. The BoE will be the clearing bank, making it the one place able to assess the spending of any given source.\nThat works for the banks – central banks are concerned that big tech companies, such as Meta/Facebook, have attempted to issue their own digital currencies to the users of their vast networks, enabling them to accrue excessive market power.\nSecond, many central banks are concerned by the decline in the use of physical cash – the ultimate form of anonymous transactions – which some have said helps to maintain public confidence in the monetary system.\nThe problem? One is that such power will be wide open to political interference and mark an increase in central bank power without sufficient scrutiny. The formation of a CBDC in the UK could also create fears about who is actually in control and who decides where money goes to and for what purposes. If we look to today’s economic and political model, we see extraordinary measures being introduced without parliamentary scrutiny.\nThe introduction of a CBDC may have far-reaching consequences for households, businesses, and the monetary system for decades to come, and may pose significant risks depending on how it is designed.\nThese risks include the state surveillance of people’s spending choices, as already mentioned. Indeed, this seems baked into the system. With full implementation the need or, indeed, the use of cash would in time become obsolete. A time frame could be set for all our monetary assets to be converted into a digital currency, where funds in an on-line account will only be accessible using software provided by The Bank of England or an agent bank. To prevent their use in large-scale criminal activity, any CBDC system could not support anonymous transactions, not in the way that cash can be spent anonymously.\nWhile there are design options that would provide some privacy safeguards, technical specifications alone may be insufficient to counter public concern over the risk of state surveillance. The Bank of England risks being drawn into controversial debates on privacy.\nOther risks? They could include financial instability as people convert bank deposits to CBDC accounts during periods of economic stress – potentially causing feverish activity and even panic should there not be sufficient investments left in place for pensions or other long term liabilities; and through the creation of a centralised point of failure that would be a target for a hostile nation state or criminal activity.\nThe overall conclusion of a House of Lords report suggests we have yet to hear a convincing case for why the UK needs a retail CBDC. Yet to date there are no safeguards to the introduction of a UK CBDC. Even some of the larger banks have expressed their reservations. And they will be at the heart of things. Under the Bank of England’s proposed CBDC model, the Bank would not provide direct CBDC accounts to customers. Instead, it would operate the core digital infrastructure to enable CBDC payments while commercial banks and other financial services providers would connect to this infrastructure to provide CBDC wallets and related services.\nA Discussion Paper produced by the BoE said this model could encourage innovation and enable “the private sector to create services that support greater choice” for consumers. But many people are sceptical that a UK CBDC payments system would provide significant advantages to consumers over the existing payments system.\nIndeed, this scepticism is underscored by the evident utility of the cash-based system we already have, for all that many people do not like to pay ‘contactless’ – not least that at the end of 2019 there were around one million people in the UK without access to a bank account. For some this has been a matter of choice. For others it’s a matter of computer illiteracy. For others simply a lack of internet access or a smartphone – costly items by some measures. The educational, technological and disposable requirements for CBDC transactions may exclude these people from accessing it.\nSure, there is a tendency to take a slightly sniffy attitude to ‘cash in hand’ work as a means of avoiding paying tax, or in some sense as cheating the welfare system. Others suggest that it suppresses wages and side lines employment rights. Yet cash still accounts for 10% of the UK’s GDP and cash-in-hand work is more often a matter of need and not greed – cash is vital for those unable to secure formal employment or as a means to supplementing an official low income, or while training. The Cost of Living Crisis is only going to encourage a wider reliance on cash-in-hand work for many.\nBut surely the most important benefit of cash is that it keeps government noses out of individuals’ private business. That’s why we should be very wary of any CDBC introduction until and unless parliament has had a say and the BoE and the Treasury produce some very convincing reports to ensure we are not being led by the nose into a situation that further undermines the democratic role of parliament and those that elect it. It is essential that there are more straightforward and targeted ways to support access to financial services than to launch a CBDC.\nI never buy from businesses that refuse to accept money the Sunak Government and the woefully useless Starmer led opposition are completely signed up towards a cashless society the SDP has until 2025 to be the alternative Government not Labour who would continue with Torylite policies\nThe right to use cash should be enshrined in law. Simple. “They” go on about freedom of choice, let the customer decide etc etc but then make it impossible for the customer to exercise that choice.\nThe Government will switch off our right to use their digital currency the moment some alleged crisis comes along to which we do not respond in the desired way. And the banks will switch off our right to use their electronic systems if we do not behave profitably for them. This is not fantasy – it is happening every day in the UK banking system and it is happening at Government level in China.\nI am completely against digital currencies and the abolition of cash. I urge SDP members to use cash whenever possible and I would like the party to make a formal commitment to keep cash and improve access to it.\nI also think that the Bank of England should issue a £100 note, as they do in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nI see an opportunity here to get the banks to oppose a CBDC. The Bank of England should be under direct government control and used to promote cash. I would like to see the party make a commitment to keep cash and never start a CBDC.\nI would also like the Bank of England to issue a £100 note to bring England and Wales into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_demographic-change-will-we-run-out-of-workers/content_252.html": "Speech by Hilary Salt at the Battle of Ideas, 19th October 2024\nWith my actuarial hat on, I did think it might be important to start by explaining some of the complexities of measuring fertility so we don’t misinterpret the data – which is very easy to do.\nYou can measure fertility using a cohort approach – this means waiting until women born in a certain year have reached the end of their childbearing years (that in itself a tricky concept though generally assumed at 45) and say how many children did they on average have. This is reliable but very delayed. Using this approach, we can now assess the fertility of women born in the late 1970s.\nUsing this approach, we can see that women born in 1977 have a completed family size of 1.94 children compared to their mothers’ generation of 2.07 and a high (at least for generations alive today) of 2.42 for women born in 1933. Much more striking is the difference in the number of children women had before they were 30 – 0.98 for the 1977 cohort and 1.54 for their mothers – so a move to later maternity. Of the 1977 cohort, 16% had no children compared to 14% of their mothers and with more of a contrast 18% had one child compared to 13% of their mothers. Two children families do remain the norm – for 38% of the 1977 cohort and 44% of their mothers.\nThe alternative is to use a period total fertility rate. This applies the recent rates of live births by age to the current female population split by age to produce a hypothetical average number of children. This approach is much more current and reactive but it can be misleading if the age at which women have children is changing – which it is – with a switch to late child birth. This means applying previous age specific rates to this year’s age structure can give the wrong answer. On this basis, the total fertility rate in 2022 was 1.46 children per woman – a significant fall from 1.94 as recently as 2010. This does seem to point to a significant fall in expected births but do note the earlier caveats about the unreliability of this approach when the age at which women give birth are changing. I am not saying there has not been a change but rather than we do need to wait for more evidence before we can be sure.\nThe need for care with the statistics has not stopped an almost apocalyptic popular discussion about the collapse in fertility. (Interestingly, a map showing total fertility rates by region does indicate a big difference between the regions of the somewhere and the anywhere twitterati regions). So should we be panicking? My view is that we shouldn’t panic but we should care.\nIt’s important to note that the relationship between the size and age structure of a population is complex. As David Bloom, the Harvard demographer and economist notes: “it is an overstatement to say that demography determines all, as it downplays the fact that both demographic trajectories and their development implications are responsive to economic incentives; to policy and institutional reforms; and to changes in technology, cultural norms, and behavior.”\nThat complexity is drowned out in popular discussion by what we might term “demographic thinking” characterized by a tendency to fatalism. We can tell these approaches are a priori thinking because at different times directly opposite claims are made. With a rising population, the doomographers say “more people, limited resources, less for all”. With falling fertility they cry “fewer people, less growth, less for all.” There does seem to be a particularly visceral worry about falling fertility – going back to Walter Bagehot claiming in 1872 that “the most successful races, other things being equal, are those which multiply the fastest”.\nIn reality, there are far more important drivers to the growth of an economy. Some are participation in the workplace (and we have a real issue here with people unable or unwilling to contribute), the quality of infrastructure and perhaps most importantly levels of business efficiency and productivity – all things we can tackle more easily than fertility rates.\nThe other reason I think we should push back against the panic about fertility is that it provides a pretext for intervention in ordinary people’s lives and in particular women’s lives. We have seen in the past how policies to address what the West saw as too many births in the underdeveloped world were couch in terms of women’s rights to education and independence. Sometimes this was done quite explicitly. Paul Ehrlich (of The Population Bomb) for example noted:\n“Women have traditionally been allowed to fulfil only the roles of wife and mother. Anything that can be done to diminish the emphasis on those roles and provide women with equal opportunities in education, employment and other areas is likely to reduce the birth rate”.\nToday we have intervention in the West with the opposite aims. Whilst I’m very happy to see financial help for those choosing to have children, I’m worried about Macron’s health checks, attacks on abortion and what seems like a concerted attempt to normalise surrogacy – the renting out of women’s bodies for reproduction.\nFor all these reasons, I want to argue against panic. But at the same time, I think we need to recognize that many young people do want to have children but are hampered by inadequate, unaffordable housing, a taxation system that provides no help to parents, exorbitant childcare costs and a general social attitude that the world isn’t fit for their children.\nWe need to support that generation in forming families by building houses and providing the financial and human support they need to allow them to share the fulfilment parenthood brings and to give them a real investment in the future.",

I’ve listened to most of the talk – really should not yet be writing – but I don’t get a sense of the nitty gritty details of what you would have done.\nDo you publish some of the ideas anywhere? Either in an essay or podcast?\nIt’s one thing to say that we need to protect children but you don’t flesh this out with information about how their parents and grandparents would be protected if all places of education are kept open.\nMy niece has an underlying health condition and is on a thumping immunosuppressant. She is at Edinburgh University. We have all kinds of discussions as many of her views fall into the area of The Great Woke !

A professional gardener who is 35 years old joked in my company that he saw Covid as revenge for older people having voted for Brexit.

These young souls who have had their educational and social experiences strangled by these lockdowns , many wont even be able to return to the service industries as that will be very much smaller. I remembered that irony of students being in quarantine whilst the pubs were open nearby for elderly people to drink as Joanne stated. I currently work in retail and you would be amazed at the number of maskless frail people buying sleeves of 100 cigarettes .As Neil Oliver says rights do come with responsibilities. Part of the reason why we have had many deaths in this country is testament to the quality of the NHS which has prolonged lives in this country to enable people to live in care homes. In other countries life expectancy is shorter and they have had less Covid deaths because they have simply died younger of other causes of which they would have survived here due to NHS treatments.\nWe have to get on with our lives these restrictions must end and if that deaf mop haired buffoon Johnson doesn’t listen then He needs to go take Hancock Witty and Sage with him\nThis government has handled Covid19 disastrously not as bad as Trump in the US or Bolsanaro in Brazil but Johnson and the 2nd rater’s in this government need holding to account",

Professions have historically been services from the educated and able intended to help people with the problems thrown up by existence in civilisation, hence medicine attends to illness, teaching to ignorance, accountancy to taxation, law to government. His corollary of honest manual work does hold true however. The difference is that the professions exist for when things go wrong for someone. The profession of priesthood stands apart as it’s origins are political, though it did much to enable the education that gave us William Harvey, et al.. As the son of a GP and a teacher myself, my father and I have largely worked in helping with people’s and pupils’ ills and ignorance, toward their forward autonomy. I liked this speech – it should be revisited in any gentle professional’s mind daily just to check that we “first do no harm”. The elites are indeed sneering and arrogant – they mightn’t have become so if the subject discoursed on was remembered. Corruption has a grip, especially today – legislated moral authority is not the professions’ to dictate; rather true professions should counter such.",

The SDP supports this move for three reasons.\n- Oil and gas remains a necessary part of the UK’s fuel mix given the interruptible nature of renewable supply. It makes neither economic nor environmental sense to import it in large quantities – and in so doing harm the nation’s balance of trade – if production is possible from domestic sources.\n- As last winter showed, energy security matters. We will improve Britain’s energy security by reducing reliance on unstable supplies from abroad.\n- A viable oil and gas industry will retain the skills to develop large-scale carbon capture in the North Sea, such as compression, pipelining and geological mapping.\nWe recognise that investors in new oil and gas fields will find it increasingly difficult to obtain bank funding for such enterprises due to the banks’ Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) pledges. The SDP’s plan for a new body ‘British Energy’ will underwrite the necessary investment to bring new fields emerging from the drilling licences into production.\nSDP leader William Clouston commented:\n“For too long Britain’s need for energy – for homes, transportation and re-industrialisation – has been subject to the whims of politicians and corporations who don’t have the nation’s interests at heart.\nThe SDP strongly supports the construction of a new generation of British nuclear power stations to help us decarbonize. However, since oil and gas are a necessary bridge to this future, it makes sense for us to produce our own rather than import it from others. The SDP supports the new licences and will underpin the finance to make it happen.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_one-cheer-for-free-ports/content_125.html": "One good reason for leaving the European Union is the opportunity to experiment and discover policy ideas which can deliver better outcomes for all of Britain than those cast fully-formed in Brussels. So the news that the Government is thinking of allowing up to 10 new ‘free ports’ is welcome: it is a start.\nBut only a start, and as things stand, the Government’s minimalist free-market plans are unlikely to make the best of the opportunity. For the policy appears to be geared principally towards establishing export-processing zones touting for European business. It’s a low-end ambition, and likely to yield low-end results.\nThere are two glaring shortcomings.\nFirst, and crucially, there’s no mention of how, or if, local democratic consent is to be won. If implementing free ports is to involve significant alterations to tax, planning, labour and environmental regimes, then the people of that area must give their consent. This is a basic democratic necessity. Without local democratic consent, every regulatory ‘relaxation’ will be seen as Westminster downgrading protections for people and communities which are already disadvantaged. The SDP is in favour of Special Economic Zones with the ability to try different policy-mixes, but not at the cost of forgetting the ‘Democratic’ centre of our ambitions.\nBut there is an equally important economic principle at stake: these SEZs need not only local democratic ‘buy-in’ (perhaps involving community shareholding), but also local control of policy development.\nThis cannot be done from Westminster. The people on the spot, struggling to make the project work, will know better and quicker what needs to be done. Controllers in Westminster probably won’t. We already know the damage done to England outside the Southeast by the Treasury’s Green Book criteria for public investment. It is unthinkable that the same people will suddenly develop the vision and courage required to driver a successful Special Economic Zone project. Even the Communist control-freaks in Beijing recognized that if Shenzhen SEZ was going to be successful, it had to be allowed its own administrative control, its own room to develop the policies it needed to grow. Will the Treasury prove less flexible than Beijing’s cadres? Quite possibly.\nThis morphs into the second shortcoming: if these free ports are to be nothing more than export-processing plants, they are likely to generate only low-margin, low-productivity companies and jobs. Any potential economic and technological gains from industrial clustering will be lost: lost because not even attempted. Worse, if implemented with minimal imagination, these free ports will simply siphon industrial activity away from their immediate hinterlands.\nThe alternative would be to designate these ‘free ports’ as SEZs dedicated to particular sectors or technologies. For example, I would love to see the Humber River Delta allowed enough regulatory flexibility to invent itself as a Circular Economy SEZ. A Circular Economy is one designed, top to bottom, to generate maximum resource efficiency, recycling and minimum waste.\nCircular Economy ideas are ambitious, but also among the best opportunity we have to start to tackle environmental issues whilst at the same time growing the economy. What’s holding back Circular Economy ideas? The core problem is that by definition the Circular Economy is completely integrated in an almost holistic way. Individual firms cannot build a Circular Economy on their own: clustered in a dedicated SEZ, they might. Imagine if a British Circular Economy SEZ discovered how to make it all work: it would constitute a new Industrial Revolution.\nSo raise one cheer for the Free Port proposals, but reserve the other two for democratic buy-in, and for industrial vision.\nA Circular Economy Special Economic Zone is all well and good, but a bit of a mouthful – such a concept will take some explaining to the ordinary voter.\nI know, and I agree. The fundamental problem of a ‘Circular Economy’ is that no-one, not even Ellen Macarthur, can fully describe it. And that’s because if it is to be a reality, rather than just companies making an effort, it has to involve considerable vertical and horizontal links in all phases of the design, production and distibution process. My belief is that this will only, and possible can only, be discovered in something like a specially purposed SEZ.\nI have wrestled, probably unsuccessfully, to make the case here, and would absolutely welcome others making the same attempt. I wish them more success than I evidently had.\nThe flip side of that, of course, is that the first country/area that can manage it, will have initiated the next industrial revolution.\nInteresting piece. Surely, whereas the lofty goal may be 100% circulatory, achieving, say, 60% would be a great improvement on the status quo and justification for this approach to be implemented.\nAgain, I agree. If a Circular Economy SEZ could get to 60%, then I’m pretty sure that you’d get a sort of Moore’s Law process going that could keep raising the ratio year by year. The concentration/clustering effect ought to be very powerful.\nI want to add something else. The current environmental movement has failed: despite all the billions spent, CO2 concentrations are still growing, and still growing at an accelerating pace. There is literally no chance of current approaches succeeding: it’s Environment WW1 out there, with the Green Generals always and only seeking one more big push, no matter what hardship that involves. We’ve got to be able to offer something better, and discovering how a Circular Economy can actually work would be more than a start – it would be the next industrial revolution.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-2021-budget/content_362.html": "The shape of the budget is right, and inescapably so. There was no option but to double down on immediate post-Covid recovery programs in all areas, whilst at the same time setting out a plausible medium and longer-term plan for guiding UK’s public finances back towards sustainability. At the same time, Rishi Sunak tiptoed towards re-balancing the UK’s distorted profit model back towards investment and productivity led growth, with a smorgasbord of tax incentives and direct government investment funding.\nFor now, this was about as sensible and ambitious as a budget could be. But this year more than any other, it is impossible to know exactly how the massive distortions in private spending, saving and investment generated by the lockdowns will turn out. Sunak hinted that he hoped that we will see a rapid return to normality, and the budget would provide ‘consumers with more opportunities to spend some of the additional £125bn of savings accumulated so far during the pandemic.’\nThis snippet reveals a glaring problem baked right into the heart of this Budget. Rishi Sunak was not celebrating the fact that household savings have risen by £125bn, nor was he happy that business deposits had grown by £100bn. Instead, the entire budget has the tacit assumption that the only value to be found in those deposits is to get them spent as soon as is possible.\nBut can anyone say for sure that the country will go on a consumption binge? Or, more profoundly, if families across the country should want to burn through their newfound savings? Perhaps many of us will find that we rather enjoy our share of that £125bn improvement in our bank balances, and don’t want to see it frittered away.\nHere, then, we see the problem: the budget had absolutely no concern with encouraging saving. Whilst trumpeting time and time again the hope for investment-led growth, Sunak never once acknowledged the link between investment and saving. If the government is serious about changing Britain’s economic model to one that’s based off investment and productivity growth – rather than a model fuelled by debt and rentierism – then you cannot ignore the role of the saver.\nThis is because, in the long run, how much you invest is determined by how much you save. In a time of near-zero interest rates, this may not seem an economic truism, but it inevitably will reassert itself with frightful force. It is simply impossible to perpetually finance the economy through pumping it full of cheap money and avoid inflation or the crowding out of productive investment spending. The concern of financing debt is especially true with the UK’s government debt, which has risen by £400 billion amid the crisis.\nThere was just a dim recognition of this awkward truth, with Sunak saying that ‘while interest rates are currently forecast to remain low, there is a risk that they could rise sharply, which would have significant consequences for the affordability of debt.’ But if this is the case, then wouldn’t it surely be a good idea to encourage a stable investor base for UK government debt? The alternative is the incredibly precarious situation we have right now, where the national finances are dependent on perpetual money-printing from the Bank of England and the confidence of the banking system.\nIn earlier times of massive crisis such as war, governments encouraged people to buy government bonds, such as war bonds and savings bonds. The reasons for this were a) to grow a stable investor base to moderate the volatility of interest rates, and b) to moderate the possibly volatile swings in consumption which can be expected in an immediate post-crisis environment – both these would be incredibly useful in 2021 and 2022.\nYet there is not even a nod in this direction. The government has plans for a UK Infrastructure Bank, to be based in Leeds apparently able to deploy £12 billion of equity and debt capital. But is it a bank? Will I, as a saver, be able to deposit my savings in it? If not, in what sense is it a bank, rather than simply another government fund? Why even call it a bank if it has no ability to collect and allocate savings profitably? The Budget tells us of plans for a Levelling Up Fund, a Futures Fund, a Community Renewal Fund, a Community Ownership Fund, and Towns Fund – will it be possible for ordinary people to directly invest in these, so they can both build their own wealth while helping the country to recover?\nThe only nod towards the saver is the possibility of a ‘green gilt’ National Savings Bond sometime in 2021, after £15bn of green gilts have been sold to banks and institutional investors. But the bottom line is this: this budget envisages net borrowing of £297.7bn, of which national savings bonds are targeted to bring in a mere £6bn – ie, 2% of the total, which is effectively a rounding error. That paltry £6bn is just 5% of the £125bn increase in household net deposits seen during the pandemic.\nWhen the government is serious about encouraging and rewarding saving, we’ll know it’s serious about pushing the UK’s growth model away from debt and towards investment and productivity. But right now, it isn’t.\nPicture by Harriet Pavey/ No 10 Downing Street\nWhat other policies would you like to have seen in the budget besides some of the ones that you had mentioned? Capital Gains Tax in line with Income Tax; LVT replacing Business Rates…\nYet again there is no mention of Adult Social Care and how the Government intend to create a sustainable solution to the rapidly crumbling system. Also, there is nothing on funding for local government. Currently local government has no certainty as to it’s future finances.\nThis Government and the current opposition in parliament is utterly awful they must be held accountable sooner than later I was proud to join the sdp last April and will so again once my membership is up for renewal in 2 weeks time, We could be an alternative Government in waiting if the sdp put themselves forward to the British people, who will soon get wake up about Johnson like they already have done with Starmer\nAtlast a party that champions saving. So long overdue. I have always been schooled by my parents to only buy something if you can truly afford it, and if you can’t work to raise the money. Also to plan for a rainy day. It has a terrible time for savers since the financial crash, yet the more you owe or borrow the more the government and banks seem to want to help. 95%mortages are back, will they ever learn? The tories credibility as a party of sound money and thrift is totally wrecked. But with an economy that buys in more than it can sell, what chance is there of ever paying the debt off? The balance of trade used to be the definitive gauge on how our nation fortunes were performing. Harold Wilson found to his cost in the 1970 election how important a bad set of trade figures could prove to be! . Now the balance of trade is just written off, as the chancellors of the last two decades continue to write “I owe you letters” for the nation’s budget spending requirements to be met. Yet everywhere wealth continues to be racked up by ‘the haves’ whilst “the have not’s” are left by the wayside. Thoughts of a humble gardener.\nComma after can’t… Sorry!",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-way-ahead/content_117.html": "Chair, conference, fellow social democrats…\nGood to be here. The way ahead – that’s the title. And we picked it because on a long march it’s a good idea at some stage to put your bags down, take a rest, look back over the ground you’ve covered and look ahead towards your destination.\nLet’s start at the start – not 1981 but seven years ago. Put up you hand if you attended the 2017 conference in Birmingham. That’s three of us then… There were fifteen people there. The party was on life support. It had 60 members, virtually no money, no votes, no regional organisation. It lacked a governing Rule Book and had barely any election capability. It had a long history and a registration with the Electoral Commission but no clear political philosophy. Be under no illusion – the task of reviving this party was huge.\nSo we started to build some foundations. The first was a structure. The SDP is a democratic party with an elected leader and a member-controlled National Committee and Regional Parties. You can’t pretend to be a democratic party. The SDP Constitution and Rule Book is a contract with members. Candidates and policies are approved by democratically – never imposed from the top.\nThe second foundation – equally important – was our political philosophy. The space we occupy in the political landscape. This is The New Declaration. In a world where most political parties are really quite unprincipled – with little idea as to their values – our little grey book has served us well. It has given the SDP something very precious – clarity, intellectual bearings and coherence.\nMichael Oakeshott said that politics was the art of persuasion. True. The New Declaration was certainly persuasive. Of the many endorsements this one is my favourite: “I couldn’t have dreamt of doing such a good job myself and didn’t want to change a single comma. I thought it was such a true transformation.” David Owen. That means a lot.\nSo we went on putting in more foundations. The End of Indifference is, I think, a brilliant work of political economy, a sharp critique of the debt-based model which has beggared the country. Our film – 10 Truths About The Migrant Crisis – properly diagnoses the causes of the chaos and points to solutions. Our agriculture green paper Farms, Fields & Food is a timely call for ecological sense, healthy produce and national resilience in food supply. On many of these issues the SDP is ahead – way ahead – of the ruling parties. That work culminated in our election manifesto – Homecoming – which was by a country mile – the best manifesto on offer.\nOur philosophy is important, but the SDP is not a think tank. It’s a political party and the currency of political parties is votes. And on that, great progress has been made. The record is as follows. In the 7 years prior to 2018 we secured a total of 594 votes in all elections. In the 7 years since we’ve secured 196,428. A little different. We’ve contested 8 parliamentary by-elections – on 4 occasions getting better results than some in the 1980s. But sometimes even taking a tank to a by-election doesn’t get you the votes you want.\nWe’ve contested 3 major metropolitan mayoral elections increasing our vote every time. In London Amy Gallagher built on Steve Kelleher’s efforts in the London Mayoral by quadrupling the SDP vote to over 34,000. Dave Bettney doubled our vote in the South Yorkshire to over 20,000. He retained our deposit, beating the Lib Dems and Greens in Doncaster, and coming within 800 odd votes of beating the Tories – the governing party remember – in Barnsley.\nIn general elections we’ve shown exponential growth. After barely registering in the 2015 and 2017 we fielded 20 candidates in 2019 securing 3,295 votes. This year we pushed up to 122 candidates and over 33,000 votes – with 6 SDP candidates getting over 1,000 votes and 2 saving their deposit. More broadly, among full-spectrum national parties – only the 5 major parties now lie ahead of us. Astonishing progress.\nBut leading a party that hadn’t taken a seat since the 80s, my first priority was simply to win an election. But where? The answer came in the form of a young man called Wayne Dixon and a place called Middleton Park. You all know the story… We took the seat from Labour and have taken two more since.\nA few years ago, people might have said… well, we don’t take the SDP very seriously. I can promise you – the Labour politicians losing their seats to us in Leeds don’t share this view.\nThere have been so many highlights on this journey. I’d like to mention a few… Patrick O’Flynn joining us – as Member of the European Parliament. Receiving an e-mail from Robert in early 2019 saying “Rod Liddle has joined” – breakthrough moment.\nDave Bettney meeting a Liberal Democrat who wasn’t a vegan. Actually we need that verified. Perhaps the BBC could help? Updating the party’s logo in 2022. Being the only party that consistently opposed pandemic lockdowns and the only party honest enough to criticise BLM’s rather flaky political philosophy. The electoral pact with Reform UK was also an achievement – although it was a bit like the supermarket trolley with the wobbly wheel…\nThe brilliant work over the years on the party’s Twitter and YouTube channels – engagement growing month by month, year by year. Getting all our candidates nominated and over the line in the general election and putting out two party election broadcasts. Phenomenal. Rod referring to the other parties’ candidates as morons on the Telegraph podcast. It could have been worse… he could have called them idiots or imbeciles…\nWayne explaining to a member of the public the central problem with Labour’s governance in Middleton Park – “They don’t do owt”. Mrs Dixon’s fantastic reaction to Wayne’s election win. The call for Andrew to Fetch The Dogs…\nI have some personal highlights. Being a regular guest on Mike Graham’s show on TalkTV and building up the SDPtalk interview series. Smoking rollies on House of Lords Terrace with Lord Glasman. Always remember what Maurice said: ‘The essence of politics is to retrieve the sense of home from the de-humanising forces of the market and the state.’ Correct.\nManaging to persuade John Cleese over tea and cake to speak at our conference – after drinking five pints and smashing a packet of camel with my favourite UnHerd writer. And reflecting after that meeting the surreal experience of spending an hour and a half with Basil Fawlty…\nBeing part of Rod’s ‘Gang of Four’ pub quiz team at St John’s Chapel in Weardale and seeing his reaction when we eventually lost. Don’t tell him it’s just a quiz. Defending Rod live on LBC after the Chancellor of the Exchequer had intervened about a controversial column he’d written in the Spectator. – It was a joke…\nSo that’s it – that’s the path we’ve taken. To be part of this journey is to have contributed to a unique period in the SDP’s 44-year history. Why? Because the past seven years is the only period in which the party has actually grown. Interesting fact. And always remember that the SDP’s revival is of us, in us and because of us. We can be very proud – not of what we started or completed but of what we’ve built. And I’d like to thank every single one of you for making it happen – particularly my core team of Valerie, Robert, Ross, Dan, Paula and Paul – but all members, candidates, activists, officials and donors. All of you. Thank you!\nNow everything I’ve described is already history. It’s in the past. We can learn from it but this conference is about the future. And we must turn to the future now.\nLet’s be clear – our aim is to build the SDP into a national political party – with a national profile, a membership sufficient to challenge every seat, and the resources to do so. This is a huge task – bigger than the one we’ve accomplished. And it will require a step change in the party’s performance.\nSuccess, I think, depends on three things – Our direction, the necessary resources and our values.\nFirst, direction. I think our political bearings are correct. In Britain we are the post-liberal conservative left, the top left quadrant of the political compass. Under my leadership, that’s not going to change. We are uniquely positioned. Most people agree with the SDP on most things. The problem is that too few of them know it.\nWhich gets us to the second pre-condition of success – the necessary resources. We need the means to tell our story, to mobilise our offer. That means a professional headquarters – Hilary may say a few words about that. It means growth in membership and bigger annual income. It means greater support for the regional parties which are the campaigning heart of the party. It means greater capacity in press and media functions. It means greater capacity in production and distribution of campaign materials. It means a broader political leadership team. Success depends on this.\nBut it’s not just about direction and resources it’s also about values. There are certain qualities needed to reach our goal. We require loyalty and fidelity to our party. We need comradeship and friendship – to fight and win together. All those messy evenings in Leeds… merriment, broken chairs – thankfully, what happens in Leeds stays in Leeds… We require tenacity – progress arrives in fits and starts and surges, sometimes you’ve just got to hold things together. Some roads ahead will be rutted. We need to show bravery – cowardice is the main failing of our ruling class and the cause of many of our problems.\nWe need to retain our seriousness. We must stay on the high ground. The test is simple – we should never be in a position where any member of the public – in a pub or cafe – wouldn’t be proud to say they’re a social democrat. That’s it. That’s the test. This matters, I think, because merit comes before progress, effort before achievement and in politics recognition and respect precedes success – something that Ernie Bevin said and understood.\nGoing forward there is considerable uncertainty. We know Labour will fail but we don’t know how Reform will perform, nor what progress Kemi Badenoch’s Tories will make. But we do know one thing – we must row our own boat and not get distracted in doing so.\nTo finish. The revival of the Social Democratic Party is an act of defiance to the way our country has been governed. To spit back at the gale – against the rottenness of the ruling parties. But it’s also an act of belief – of faith if you like – that we can do better and we must.\nA friend said to me recently – I love the SDP. It’s the soul of the country.\nI agree. Thank you.",

This means increasing the number of students doing BTEC programmes and increasing access for students to move into employment through this pathway.\n- Outside English and Mathematics, school assessments will accord the same value to technical and vocational courses as to academic subjects, provided that a healthy balance of both technical and academic courses is offered.\n- Employers who take on a graduate apprentice from a technical school / BTEC programme at the age of 16 will receive a rebate of 25% of the first year’s wages for that employee. Employers who take on a school leaver without a basic qualification will be rebated 75% of the apprenticeship wage for two years, subject to a suitable training programme.\n- Suitable technical courses (equivalent to the current BTEC Level 3 at age 18) will be the normal requirement for acceptance into paid on-job training for public sector roles such as nursing and policing, which presently require degree courses.\nAcademic and general\n- New grammar schools will be established across the country in regional towns with relative disadvantage. Students will be admitted to these via examination and teacher assessment at KS3 (age 14).\n- Free school meals will be provided to all state school educated children during term time only.\n- We will reinforce the teaching of British history, politics, geography and literature up to GCSE level. Teaching in humanities subjects will be balanced and honest, and reflect Britain’s important contribution to the world in the context of its time. Teachers will avoid advocacy of unorthodox or sectarian agendas.\n- A new subject, Wellness, will be introduced to the national curriculum in place of the current PHSE. This will instruct students in good psychological and lifestyle habits, including nutritional and physical fitness goals, money management, home economics, cyberhealth, self-control, good manners, the destructiveness of drugs etc.\n- We will widen existing pathways for experienced people with relevant experience to come into teaching via a six-month on-job training probationary programme. A CV with significant life experience and demonstrated subject mastery will be required.\n- A national programme of resources and online support will be developed for parents who wish to home-school their children. Children who are home-schooled will sit invigilated key stage examinations and undergo safeguarding and socialisation checks at the appropriate ages.\n- Arbitrary limits on school exclusions will be scrapped. Students who are excluded for persistent disruptive behaviour will attend specialist schools where additional psychological and parenting support will be provided.",

A successful business woman who stood as an SDP candidate in the recent general election, Hilary is the party’s first deputy leader.\nHilary says: “I’m proud and honoured to be appointed as Deputy Leader. I’ll be joining forces with William Clouston, the Party Leader, to meet the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. We saw a huge increase in the number of party members standing for election this year, and we want to build on that and get our message out.”\nIn the recent general election, Hilary stood as an SDP candidate in the Wythenshawe and Sale East constituency.\nShe says: “Election campaigns are a great opportunity for political parties and activists. It’s the only time when we can ask members of the public what they think about the world and how they’d like to change it. As John Stuart Mill argued, we support free speech because it sharpens our ideas and makes us better at expressing them. I’m keen to draw on the experiences of SDP members in the coming period.”\nHilary was a founding partner of First Actuarial, a leading pensions consultancy. Over 20 years, she helped grow a commercially sustainable business which today employs more than 450 employees. In 2012, she was named Actuary of the Year. Hilary retired from the company before the general election, but continues to sit on the Council of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.\nAs a leading finance professional, Hilary will have a central role to play in the development of the SDP’s distinctive economic policies, which were the centrepiece of the party’s election manifesto.\nHilary says: “Only by growing profitable and high-value businesses can we make the social changes in areas like housing and health that are desperately needed. You can’t just leave economic growth to the market – the state has an important part to play. We want to see universities, businesses and the state in partnership to foster innovation throughout the UK.”\nWilliam Clouston, Party Leader of the SDP, concludes: “Hilary brings the right qualities to the role of Deputy Leader at the right time. We see eye to eye on policy – we’re left-leaning on the economy and sensible on cultural issues. Her appointment comes after an election in which the SDP was the only party to increase its vote by an order of magnitude. It was a great campaign for us – we doubled our vote per candidate and experienced a rapid growth in membership. Hilary and I are justifiably excited about the future.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_crossroads/content_423.html": "Could the road less travelled be the path to power?\nAn SDP member and former parliamentary candidate – @AlbionsBlues on ‘X’ – writes:\nMembers of the SDP will gather in Manchester shortly for their annual conference. With Labour securely installed in government, the Tories limping on, the Liberal Democrats gifted 72 seats, and Reform set to attract the growing disenfranchised, there’s much to discuss. Namely, where do we go from here?\nOlder members take inspiration from the original SDP, but we would do well to remember what gave David Owen and co their impetus and near breakthrough. It was the promise of a new kind of politics.\nA recent UnHerd interview with Dr Owen suggested – at least to this listener – that this promise was built on little more than wariness at Labour’s drift toward militancy, an admiration for Willy Brandt’s West German Social Democrats, and, perhaps, something of that Eurocommunism vibe present in Europe at the time.\nStill, those ‘80s pioneers recognised there was an appetite across the country for something new. For something ‘politics as usual’ could not deliver.\nFast forward 40 years and in a recent interview William Clouston said: “Part of our political project as a party is to bring people together, to try to find a new us.” Later, in conversation with Mike Graham, he suggested, “What I’d really like to see is a grand coalition”.\nGrand coalition\nYou could argue this is an idea born of desperation. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong. If you believe as I do that the crisis we face is existential, then the stakes could not be higher. There is a growing constituency of people alienated and all but excluded from power in their own land. ‘Politics as usual’ will not deliver change. A different approach is urgently needed.\nPolitical parties large and small assume their focus must be on elections. But for us, here and now, electorally insignificant and nobbled by a grossly unfair electoral system, is that true?\nThe Brexit referendum showed what an extra-parliamentary alliance can achieve, while in the US, Trump’s recent triumph was built on an unprecedented, remarkably diverse coalition. There appears to be potential for a similar coming together of disparate groups here in the UK. The key questions: How? And for what?\nBen Cobley wrote recently: “This social and political deficit is also a deficit of democratic society. Democracy doesn’t just consist of voting. Indeed voting seems to achieve relatively little (just ask Conservative or Brexit voters of recent times). In the years between votes, civil society keeps up its own pressure on whoever happens to be in power through constant activity and intervention, amplified by 24-hour media and social media.”\nHere then should be our focus. As Cobley says, “Those who are not represented in this arena are easy to ignore or manage away and their democratic participation will be markedly inferior as a result.”\nReform would likely spearhead any such coalition, but may now be too captured, too enticed by ‘politics as usual’ and the lure of respectability to initiate and champion the idea. Someone or some group must step up, must be prepared, at the risk of appearing naive, to inspire and champion this coalition, and define its goal.\nWhat exactly would be the purpose of this coalition? It should be to secure a referendum on an issue of profound importance, either 1) Immigration, or 2) Proportional Representation. Choosing between these is a strategic decision for another day; the aim here is to persuade you of the merits of this complete reset of our party’s objectives for the next four years.\nAn opportunity for the SDP?\nI believe so, but I’m not talking merely about a continuation or even expansion of our previous pact with Reform. This is about radically changing the way we as a party do politics, by making advocacy for and development of this coalition our sole focus for the duration of this parliament.\nDepending on the subject of the referendum, this coalition could attract all those currently unrepresented in mainstream politics other than by Reform (immigration), or a broader group still, including such unlikely allies as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens (PR).\nEither way, it’s clear ‘the based’ must initiate this. I’m talking here about those who recognise this as an emergency; who know the mainstream media for what it is; who don’t need the term ‘duopoly’ explained to them; who watch, aghast, at the return of antisemitism; who understand the significance of the ‘culture wars’. For the SDP specifically, it’s the chance to be seen to lead.\nDay to day\nHow would this work? What exactly would we be doing? Advocacy, in all its forms, acting as a think tank-cum-campaign group, with membership participation to the fore, and using all means and channels possible to promote the idea of a coalition. We would of course continue to support (and cherish) our elected councillors, but our resources would not be spent trying to add to them – at least, not unless, as part of said coalition, we were nominated to put forward candidates.\nThis is about facing up to reality. Our society is being destroyed. Time is short. Reform has tremendous momentum. On the most fundamental issues facing the country, we are in broad agreement. On other policy areas, our influence can already be seen to be bearing fruit. And in the absence of power, influence is a very good thing.\nIt’s not about us being modest. There’s potential here for the SDP to more than pull its own weight in any such coalition, providing the backbone, radical edge and intellectual clout that Reform lack.\nLike me you no doubt want to see William Clouston, Cllr Wayne Dixon and others elected to Parliament in four years’ time. As leading members and chosen candidates of the aforesaid coalition, forged and battle-hardened over these next few years, their chances would be greatly enhanced.\nI believe an extra-parliamentary coalition could be what William Clouston has called left conservatism’s last chance of steering the UK away from disaster. We have four years max. The SDP claims to be aligned with all the key political positions favoured by the majority of the country. It’s time we proved it.\nThe “Make Votes Matter” group already has a loose alliance of interested parties etc on their website; @AlbionsBlues suggests an extra-parliamentary campaign group spearheaded by the SDP, I definitely think this would be a good and also culturally necessary idea, I would favour the theme of the campaign as voting reform rather than immigration if these are the two options as suggested in the excellent article.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-waiting-game-small-parties-needs-to-breakthrough/content_57.html": "As a Brexit supporter I was disenfranchised by the Labour Party. Much of it was conspiring to reject the mandate, to dilute or even prevent the delivery of it. I did not vote in 2017 and reluctantly willed the Conservatives to win, only campaigning for pro-Brexit Labour MPs. Then the Tories messed up the election and Mrs May made a similar dog’s breakfast of the negotiations.\nEnter Mr Farage with The Brexit Party. Here was a weapon against both of them – a plague on both their houses. I went to their rallies, put up their posters and voted to return two MEPs in their landslide victory. Mr Johnson was then leant my support in 2019 – a support he enjoyed from many voters like me – and he romped home. Then he locked us all up a year later.\nIn the aftermath of the 2019 General Election I watched The Brexit Party, soon to become Reform UK, with interest. The Social Democratic Party then appeared. “What?” I asked. “Those 1980s Europhiles who bailed on Michael Foot?” No, I found – they were different now, pro-Brexit and socially conservative since the Lib Dems split away. Reform was the more prominent, but the SDP was closest to my economic politics. It seemed to me here, potentially, were the new Tory and Labour parties. They were economically opposed but both common sense and patriotic – the answer to their aged parents now captured by globalism and ‘social justice’.\nYet in election after election I have watched neither party manage to make much impact. Council elections, mayoral runs and by-elections have sped by, yielding nothing. Sometimes the vote tally has only reached double digits. Between them they have a handful of council seats, with the SDP doing especially well in Leeds.\nI know how difficult building a party or political base is, but I feel more should have been achieved. The Reform Party especially has been underwhelming, whereas the SDP, with its smaller profile, can be let off somewhat. It’s not just about the parties, it’s about people not looking beyond the traditional duopoly, or not believing there is an alternative, or simply being tired of the constant political psychodrama. Nevertheless, in my estimation, the SDP and Reform have to break through for anything to change in this country. So what are the causes for their underperformance, and what can they do?\nTHE VOTING SYSTEM\nThe obvious cause – as other contributo- rs have recently discussed before on SDP Talks is the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system, which keeps the two main parties in power and makes it very difficult for anyone else. Despite the potential risks involved, some form of proportional representation (PR) would be purer democracy, and is the only realistic chance of smaller parties making the big time.\nFPTP doesn’t make breaking through impossible, and parties such as the Scottish National Party, UKIP, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats have become influential to varying levels. The SDP itself was impactful for a time when it formed. UKIP won council seats (and admittedly European Parliament seats under PR) to apply pressure on the Tory government to call a referendum on EU membership. The Brexit Party picked up that baton and ensured the Conservatives actually delivered (mostly) Brexit.\nEARLY PROBLEMS\nThe notion of ‘job done’ on Brexit, mixed with the new interest in Johnson’s Conservatives and then the stasis of Covid, killed a lot of Reform’s momentum. Both Reform and the SDP opposed extended lockdowns and, despite plenty of Tories and Labour voters being disgusted at the policy, this didn’t translate into votes. Perhaps the ‘anti vaxxer’ and ‘Covid-denier’ labels levelled at both may have put some of the public off. Ironically, of course, many Covid-sceptics considered the parties too tame on lockdown measures and vaccine coercion – especially Reform, with a few unfortunate comments from Farage and others.\nFARAGE\nFor Reform, Farage really is the key factor. Without him The Brexit Party or UKIP would not have had the success they did. His presence would immediately ignite the excitement of Reform’s support base, and voters beyond. You get the impression he is biding his time, waiting for the optimum moment and leaving Tice as a placeholder. But it could be he is happy being a broadcaster on GB News and won’t return to the fray even when he is needed. As for him rejoining the Conservative Party as recently discussed, that’s for the birds.\nMEMBERSHIP MODEL\nMy main issue with Reform is that it is not a democratic party. It is a company that puts out candidates. Its leader cannot be elected and its policies are chosen at the top. I understand why, having seen the situation with UKIP, where it slipped Farage’s control and led to an anti-Islam faction becoming prominent. To rectify this, and keep broad support for Brexit, he used the Brexit Party to kill UKIP off. He now keeps Reform there waiting should he need it again. It is clever power politics, but it is not sustainable for a political party – especially one dedicated to delivering on a referendum. The SDP has no such problems – it is fully democratic.\nSMALLER PARTIES\nTo discuss for a moment the other smaller parties, on the right we have UKIP, the Laurence Fox vehicle Reclaim, and David Kurten’s The Heritage Party. These are rather too ‘toxic’ for mainstream voters, in particular Reclaim, considering recent unwise behaviour by Fox. This is not intended as a slight on these parties – just an observation of public perception.\nOn the left, meanwhile, there are some small socialist parties. George Galloway’s Worker’s Party of Great Britain is the most prominent, which has similar issues of toxicity. Galloway’s unique selling point is he’s a ‘based’ socialist with no time for identity politics other than class, and a distrust of internationalism, where others such as those in Momentum have embraced both. There is also the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) and older groups knocking about. TUSC caters more for the Corbynite exiles from Labour, and perhaps will shortly be joined by Corbyn himself.\nI do believe there is a place for a socialist party, but these are all far too left-wing for me, and the same will go for the British public in general. The SDP meanwhile promotes centre-left, more free market economics – as Labour traditionally do. However, their socially conservative aspect sets them apart, and also pitches wisely at the public mood. Most people don’t want to badmouth the country, or rail against ‘white supremacy’ and the family, or question what a woman is. Neither do they want a hyper-capitalist neoliberal approach. They want well-funded public services and a strong community, which the SPD offers with its ‘communitarian’ ethos.\nNEOLIBERALISM\nAnother issue with Reform is they are, at their hearts, neoliberal Thatcherites, concerned with free markets, low taxes, deregulation and fiscal discipline. There is a place for a party that genuinely offers this, as the Conservatives have become high tax and high spend, as well as influenced by ‘progressivism’. However in its pure form, neoliberalism is to be avoided. It was a massive wrong turn for the Western world and is not what we want as a country.\nIn a nutshell the ethos is about markets ruling most aspects of society, with the government mainly concerned with preventing inflation through interest rates and keeping law and order. Privatisation, anti-union action and spending cuts are the means of doing this. It has caused misery and social destruction, and by putting key issues outside of the public realm it is inherently antidemocratic. In the industrial areas, especially in the North, it cheated a whole generation out of work, prosperity and purpose.\nThis is why the voters of those areas will not go for a party they suspect of Thatcherism. They are even less likely to do so if Tice persists with clumsily labelling the Tories the ‘Consocialists’. Many backed The Brexit Party in the EU elections because it was a weapon against the elites ignoring their decision. They went for Johnson for the same reason, and also because of the question marks over Corbyn’s patriotism. These were unusual circumstances and these preferences were not about economic concerns. Johnson and Cummings tried to engineer a realignment of politics and keep these voters on board with their ‘levelling up’ splurge, but in the aftermath of Covid and the fall of Johnson that has failed.\nThese Red Wall voters will revert to Labour without a social democratic alternative, despite Labour being a little neoliberal itself – despite its mass immigration, Brexit hatred and ‘progressivism’. These voters, of course, are much more the natural supporters of the SDP, though the party may struggle to make itself known to them.\nBecause they are populists, Reform have a few socialistic policies, such as nationalising 50% of ‘key’ utilities (and having the other half owned by British pension funds). Even Thatcher had some, because the post-War consensus demanded it. Nevertheless, compared to the SDP’s proposals to nationalise power, water and the railways, mass build council housing and have a national investment bank, Reform pales in comparison.\nIndeed, plenty on the dissident right despise Thatcher’s legacy as well. They bemoan the market forces that have led to globalism and supplanted our national identity and our independence. These people are now actively cheering on the destruction of the Tory Party, and are not likely to be too enthused by similar tendencies in Reform. My advice would be for Reform to distance itself from neoliberalism and embrace the dissident conservative view.\nDEFECTORS\nThe SDP could do with some Labour figures defecting on points of principle. Goodness knows people like Rosie Duffield and Paul Embery have taken enough abuse from the party – their admirable loyalty not returned. It would raise profile and, if involving MPs or councillors, obtain some power. However, it would be the honourable thing in such an instance to have them resign and run in a by-election. The SDP are not the caddish Change UK, after all…\nEXPOSURE\nWilliam Clouston appears often on Mike Graham’s Talk TV show. While Reform is seen quite a lot on GB News and sometimes more mainstream channels, the SDP features much less. Apart from times during elections where they have to be given airtime by law, they have not appeared on mainstream media since they were the third party in the 1980s. The SDP should hustle harder for appearances – although because they might present a threat to Labour, perhaps this explains why they are being denied.\nAnother reason could be that because of its Farage associations, Reform has a more controversial edge, and that gets more ratings than the comparatively moderate Clouston. That’s not to say the SDP should be needlessly provocative, but perhaps it could be punchier to woo the TV producers.\nOf course, we are in the era where broadcast media can be outflanked and is becoming less important compared to alternative media online. The SDP should appear on large video platform channels to reach the hundreds of thousands of subscribers they have. There are a lot out there that share the same socially conservative ground. Clouston has been on Triggernometry and New Culture Forum, but there are many others. Podcasts and live-streams are long form and contemplative, which is perfect for getting complex ideas out there, rather than the quick bursts on news channels.\nDoubtless the SDP is attempting this, but the party needs to up its game on its social media too. It needs teams of young, creative, tech savvy folk maximising exposure and keeping a high standard of quality control.\nTHE TOP TEAM\nClouston cannot do the heavy lifting alone. There need to be several prominent people within the party. Rod Liddle and Patrick O’Flynn are the only publicly known lieutenants – and neither are very active with their SDP hats on. The SDP conferences feature fairly well-known guest speakers who don’t then take up the flag. People with star power need to do this. Imagine for a moment if a figure like JK Rowling got on board over the trans issue… The SDP shouldn’t take any celebrity just for celebrity’s sake, or compromise their polices to secure one – but surely somebody could be found to fit the bill. Parties are like bands or football teams – you need recognisable figures with distinct skills and styles to build a sort of public mythos.\nLOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE\nLocal events are another key factor in campaigning. Clouston and Co should tour the country, addressing meetings, raising funds and signing up supporters. People really respond to live events. It brings them together and increases morale, as well as letting them appreciate (hopefully) good public speaking. Besides, the key thing for any party is the ordinary members on the ground. Until there is a community and people willing to put leaflets through doors and take elected positions, a party gets nowhere.\nMONEY\nOf course the most important factor in a political party is funding. Nothing can get done without it, a major cost being printing and distributing literature, as well as advertising. Paid staff and office space are needed to really professionalise the operation. The larger parties rely on rich donors, corporations and, in the case of Labour, trade unions. Another major source of money is the membership paying their subscriptions and occasional extra donations. The bigger the membership, the bigger the coffers. It is also a lot heathier to get income this way then being beholden to vested interests. Certainly that has been the downfall of Labour and the Tories.\nReform – for now – has better funding than the SDP. However, the SDP announced at its conference that it has secured a million pounds from an undisclosed donor, which is a great start. Nevertheless, political parties are renowned for burning cash. Without a steadily growing membership and committed donors, progress can easily stall. Thus all effort has to be put into maintaining these aspects.\nPOLICIES\nOne thing that can boost membership is having flagship policies that differentiate a party from its competitors. It is effective to hold a stance that will have popular backing, but which the main parties are too cowardly to touch. UKIP, The Brexit Party and the SDP had leaving the EU, an issue that had been simmering since the EEC ballooned into something not advertised in 1975. The three key issues today, which are not served by the mainstream parties, are immigration, the Channel crisis and energy and ‘Net Zero’. None of the main parties are willing to fully change position on either, when what we need are radical departures from the norm.\nBoth Reform and the SDP do offer such departures. With energy, both parties are against the Net Zero targets (while still asserting manmade climate change is real and a problem). Reform politicians are more anti-Net Zero in their public appearances, but the SDP’s literature is just as strong. Both parties are in favour of fracking and extracting North Sea gas and oil, at least while fossil fuels are important in the energy mix. Both are clear development of nuclear energy is essential.\nThe SDP is more resolute than Reform on immigration – pledging a pause on mass immigration (above 50,000 a year) while we take stock and prioritise integration of those that have come. I notice with some disappointment this has been diluted from the total ‘moratorium’ on immigration promised before, but I understand the new policy is a little more realistic. Reform just wants a tougher points-based system than the damp squib the Tories have presided over. On the Channel Crisis, both parties have a tough stance and advocate leaving the ECHR and UN Refugee Convention. Both support refusing asylum to anyone who turns up uninvited, which would necessitate this, and offshore processing. The SDP want the processing on remote British territory so we have more control over it. The ever subtle Reform is a little more ‘tow the boats back to France’ than the SDP.\nBoth parties need more of the same on these key issues. They need also to find other topics that will be electorally lucrative (as well as useful for the country). Often the large parties can be quite myopic in spotting things and sluggish in forming policy.\nLocal policies are also vital in appealing to voters. This is often another blind spot for the big parties. They tend to fixate on their national agenda. The majority of the public often write off the national parties on this basis, which explains why council elections have such low turn-outs. The more successful councillors of major parties might take it upon themselves to champion certain local issues, while independents are even freer to do so. The SDP and Reform don’t need to pull a Lib Dems and change their very ethos depending on geography, but they should still keep a keen eye out for issues local residents care about, and once elected should take action to address them. The SDP’s Councillor Wayne Dixon has done well at this in Leeds, by all accounts.\nI would suggest planning is a policy area both Reform and the SDP are rather too ‘Yimby’ [Yes In My Back Yard] on. Others will approve of this, but I do feel the imposition of mass developments on communities can be very detrimental, particularly ugly and low quality builds, or builds nobody can afford. Both parties should balance the urgency of the housing crisis with honouring local democracy and mitigating these concerns. The answer is not only deregulation.\nPACTS\nWithin the SDP, there has been much controversy about the limited election pact made with Reform. The SDP has agreed not to stand against Reform in its top six target seats, and vice versa. This is sensible. There is no point in cancelling one another out, as there is an overlap in their current support bases. They can win these seats and then do battle with each other once they’ve done this. Yes, Reform is controversial – but then so to some extent is the SDP. Both parties get tarred by the ‘far right’ brush, whatever they do. The SDP seems especially hated because it’s of the left. The type of person saying these things is not going to be won over whether there is a pact or not. Average voters, meanwhile, will be much less bothered. We will see if the scheme bears fruit. If it does yield results, more comprehensive pacts might be considered – not just with Reform but perhaps with independents as well.\nIN SUMMARY\nThere are no easy answers here. The system is rigged against any small party. It is designed that way by the red and blue teams, to benefit them and safeguard against any ‘extremism’ seen in other nations. In our current dire straits, of course, common sense has become ‘extremism’, and certain points of extremism have become the status quo. Mass immigration, pandering to absurd minority views, curbing of free speech, economically flawed green agendas and medical authoritarianism have all taken centre stage. Thus the hopes of the SDP and Reform seem dashed before these parties can even get a glimpse of government.\nNevertheless even within FPTP, powerful political movements can grow and if not lead, they can be influential. And even if it is hopeless, it is human nature to try, to rage against the dying of the light. Doing something is better than doing nothing. The endeavour of building – if not a new government – a likeminded community with political clout is enjoyable and worthy in itself. If it can provide something to the debate others do not, it is still a public service.\nNever underestimate the moral majority of this country. The SDP and Reform are both saying common sense things that ordinary people – be they on the left, right or centre – agree with. These people might not be comfortable in saying some of it out loud, but given the right conditions they will vote for a party pledging such policies. Most folk do not spend all day steeped in politics and current affairs. They have general instincts about issues, but not necessarily the full range of information in order to have strong positions. They may not even know about these smaller parties, or perhaps they do not believe such players can break through. Maybe they reluctantly vote Tory or Labour, possibly switching between the two, or they might not vote at all out of weariness.\nWhatever their motives, the key is to reach those people and give them confidence, to provide on the ballot paper a box for them to put their tick against. Once you get a vote, you get someone more likely to join and stand for your party. What follows is everything needed to take the project forward – money, publicity, manpower, greater organisation and so on. That’s the name of the game. Except of course it’s not a game, it is the only way to address the dreadful ills besetting our nation.\nI care little for the Reform Party I would like to see the Destruction of the 4 useless parties it will happen sooner rather than later, Sunak will be gone by the New year or Spring hopefully earlier, I do not believe the British People have little time for Keir Starmer either I just switch to television or radio off when I Starmer’s irritating voice appear his Shadow cabinet are mediocrities, We can organise a movement to encourage the British People to boycott the 4 useless parties\nI honestly don’t know how long Rosie Duffield MP will last as a Labour MP…..she has been treated very badly, even in the Commons.",

The SDP vote was particularly strong in the Doncaster division where the party knocked the Greens and the Liberal Democrats into fourth and fifth places respectively. David Bettney’s total vote increased from 10,177 in the previous Mayoral contest – a increase of over 204%.\nSDP candidate David Bettney commented:\n“I’d like to thank the voters of South Yorkshire. I massively appreciate every single vote. This is the one chance people have of making their voice, beliefs and needs heard by the people in power, and they gave their vote to the SDP to magnify that voice.\nIncreasing numbers of people in South Yorkshire have shown that they are willing to look at other genuine alternatives, and get behind us.\nTo beat the Lib Dems and Greens in Doncaster, and get roughly the same votes as the Tories in Barnsley, shows that the SDP can start genuinely competing with the establishment parties.”\nSDP Leader William Clouston said:\n“I’m delighted with this landmark result in South Yorkshire – the first time the SDP has retained its deposit in a major election since the 1980s. I’d like to thank David Bettney and his team for all their work within the communities of South Yorkshire – that’s the basis of this achievement. This result did not come about overnight.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_how-to-leave-a-gift-to-the-sdp-in-your-will/content_55.html": "But building a real alternative to the tired old two-party system will take everything we’ve got.\nBy leaving a gift – large or small – to the SDP, you can continue to make a difference even when you’re no longer with us. You’ll be helping us to work towards a positive political future, as we continue to grow as a political force.\nHow to leave a gift to the SDP\nWriting a will – or amending an existing one – is the most effective way to leave a gift to the SDP.\nThere are various types of gift that you can leave in your will, and a solicitor can advise you on the most appropriate:\n- Pecuniary gift – A set amount of money.\n- Residuary gift – A percentage of your estate after debts, taxes and other gifts have been paid. Because this isn’t a set amount, you won’t have to keep it updated as circumstances change. And you won’t have to worry about inflation.\n- Reversionary gift – A gift which prioritises any named family members and friends, making sure they are cared for before the SDP receives your gift.\n- Specific gift – One or more specified items, such as a property, jewellery, or investments.\nTo avoid confusion or delay, it’s vital that you or your solicitor write the SDP’s full name and address correctly in your will:\nSocial Democratic Party\n272 Bath Street\nGlasgow\nG2 4JR\nWe recommend you seek advice from your solicitor when you draw up your will. They have the skills and experience to point out any pitfalls or gaps. And always remember that you can update your will at any time, as and when your circumstances change.\nKeep copies of your will safe and easily accessible upon your death. And keep it up to date, particularly if your circumstances change.\n“I decided to leave money in my will to the SDP, as it’s the party that I agree with most. It turned out to be easy to arrange. I did it through my solicitor when he wrote to me – as he does every five years or so – to ask if the provisions I’d made in my last will were still appropriate. I decided to ditch some of the charities I’d previously named as their values no longer align with mine, and replaced them with the SDP.”\nAnne, North West\nGet in touch\nIt would be really helpful if you could let us know that you’ve left us a legacy in your will. But if you prefer not to tell us, that’s fine too.\nIf you’ve got any questions, or simply want to discuss your legacy, email us at legacy@sdp.org.uk. We will respect your privacy and treat you with sensitivity and respect.\nFAQs\nDo I need a will?\nWithout a will, you have no control over your estate. You may not be passing it to the people and organisations you most want to help. The legal system will decide who receives what, and none of your estate would be passed to the SDP. Your estate is also unlikely to be tax-efficient without good planning.\nHow can I change an existing will to leave a gift to the SDP?\nPeople’s circumstances change, and you may want to update your existing will. For simple changes, you can add a codicil, which is like an appendix to your will. But complex changes will require a new will, and you should make sure that any previous wills are destroyed or clearly marked as out of date.\nDo I need an executor for my will?\nYou will need at least one executor who will be responsible for carrying out the instructions in your will. Most people have between two and four executors. You may also wish to appoint a (chargeable) professional executor such as a solicitor.\nCan I write my own will?\nYou can, but it makes sense to hire a solicitor, not least because just one small error can invalidate an entire will. To save money, you may want to plan ahead of your appointment with a solicitor by listing all the gifts you’d like to leave.\nHow do I find a solicitor?\nThe Law Society provides a number of contact to help you find a solicitor, depending on where you live in the UK\n| Location | Website | Phone number |\n| England and Wales | www.lawsociety.co.uk | 0870 606 2555 |\n| Scotland | www.lawscot.org.uk | 0131 226 7411 |\n| Northern Ireland | www.lawsoc-ni.org | 028 9023 1614 |\n| Channel Islands | www.jerseylawsociety.je | 01534 601 700 |\n| Isle of Man | www.iomlawsociety.co.im | 01624 662910 |\nWhat is the SDP’s full name and postal address?\nIf you’re planning to leave the SDP a bequest, you’ll need the correct wording, which is:\nSocial Democratic Party\n272 Bath Street\nGlasgow\nG2 4JR\nShould I inform the SDP of my plans?\nIt would be helpful if you would let us know that you have named the SDP in your will.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_integration-into-what-immigration-and-multiculturalism/content_400.html": "Speech by William Clouston at the Battle of Ideas, Sunday 20th October 2024\nThe challenge – amid atomisation and the loss of the common life – is to find a new us.\nTHREE OBSERVATIONS:\nWe’re living through the latest stage in a progressive project to re-make society. Large-scale immigration and multiculturalism is an experiment which carries very high social and political risks. It’s unprecedented – but warnings of the risks have been largely ignored. In-group preference, clannishness, that hardy perennial – racism – and even the fact that human beings can at times be violent animals should be weighed into any multicultural project. The lack of any plan for integration is concerning in a country currently filled with self-doubt and self-hatred – culturally, at war with itself. This session poses the question – integration into what? And it’s good question…\nQuote:\n“Europe has contrived to weaken national identities at a time when the legitimacy of its institutions has never been more widely questioned. It is a dangerous place to launch an experiment in liberal utopianism.”\nJohn Gray\nIt’s vital to grasp that immigrants make the places they go to a lot like the places they’ve left. Assimilation – full assimilation – is a myth. Cultural traits, beliefs, practices are highly persistent across generations. They’re sticky. It’s unreasonable and unrealistic to expect people to simply shed their beliefs – particularly religious and cultural beliefs – on arrival. It won’t happen. If you import millions of people with belief x – do not expect them to change it to belief y. Culture migrates.\nSuper diversity is not a strength. The slogan ‘diversity is our strength’ is an unscientific cliche – a piece of crude political propaganda.\nBob Putnam was correct in saying that some diversity can be a strength but that super diversity lowers social trust, solidarity and sharing.\nThat’s what the data says. David Goodhart was right to ask the question – Too Diverse? The lesson is that diversity must have limits – or Beirut will be our likely destination.\nHOW TO IMPROVE NATIONAL SOLIDARITY?\nFirst, bring the question of immigration and border security under democratic control by aligning it to public sentiment. The survival of the nation state – as a coherent and safe dominion – depends on border control. This will be harder than we might realise. Our political elites have lied to us for over a generation. And policy is outsourced to trans-national legal architecture.\nSecond, end our chronic addiction to mass immigration. Stop using immigration as a short-term fix – a sticking plaster – to plug labour market gaps. Do some sensible labour market planning. Train British people, give them the skills they need.\nThird, heresy… adopt the principle that immigration should benefit the British people. Therefore, it must be highly selective and at much lower levels. Despite what our ruling class thinks… our country is not a shop and it is not a charity.\nFourth, end all DEI appointments and ban Critical Race Theory in public institutions. Accusative anti-white gaslighting and agitation is not helpful. It’s not going to bring anyone together and the state should not be paying for it.\nFinally, I believe that strong civic nationalism is our only hope – the only chance we have of finding a new us.

This poses a grave danger to local government accountability across Surrey, while also reducing the relative power of individuals and communities throughout the county.\n“As a communitarian party, the SDP believes councillors or officers of local government are firstly and foremostly representatives of the people for whom it provides services,” says Pip English, SDP South East Chairman. “This proposal from Surrey County Council shows a complete failure to comprehend this truth. Through regarding the value of local government only in financial terms, this proposal would create an impenetrable bureaucratic mess that would be inflexible to the interests of people across Surrey.”\n“It is the people of Surrey who should ultimately decide how their local services are delivered, and this proposal by the council has fundamentally failed to consider this. Instead, Surrey County Council plans to conduct a cursory survey of the local population that will fail to take into account their desire to have accessible and local representatives and institutions,” added Ian Woodley, SDP Surrey Organiser.\nThe SDP calls upon Surrey County Council to abandon this proposal, and instead investigate the counter-proposal of the Surrey Leaders’ Group of splitting the county into three equally-sized local authorities of 400,000 people. This would preserve accountability, improve administrative efficiency, and ensure the council can focus its energy on its main task – delivering vital services for local people.",

Our language and laws are being altered to fit this new ideology.\nChallenging these assertions tends to provoke a serious backlash, yet most people instinctively know that biological sex is real and crucially important in contexts such as healthcare, sports and women-only spaces.\nKathleen and William explore the philosophical ideas behind gender identity theory and discuss the social, political and legal impacts of denying biological reality.\nWell.

We have the British Middle class, especially the young metropolitan elite, many of whom see free speech as threatening, almost illegitimate. But then there is also our whole legal system, swamped by a new set of rules – some imposed socially and some, for example, by employers – that are forcing people to adopt beliefs that they don’t really believe. Self-censorship follows.\nIn many respects, people almost seem to have given up on traditional enlightenment ideas of liberty. Or to at least have been slowly awakened to the notion that the rights that many thought we enjoyed, and which we have cherished for centuries – the right to know what one is being accused of and by whom, for example – have withered. This may not be the case in the law courts perhaps, but certainly in many other institutions in which a large number of people spend their careers, or under whose influence they live. This is something that is worrying. Yet we seem to have acquiesced to it over the last 20 to 30 years.\n“People who have offended progressive norms or who are seen as the enemy of the progressive alliance are visited by the police, whilst extremists who preach jihad seem to get a relatively easy ride,” as Ed West has noted on Substack.\nAccording to Professor Robert Paul Tombs, professor emeritus of French history at the University of Cambridge, we are now witnessing the resurgence of a kind of Victorian level moral policing by the respectable woke, in which people who are thought to be not respectable – for example football fans or middle-aged women or men questioning transgender – are people who should be properly brought under control.\nIt was the 1960s that witnessed the decline of Victorian morality and the advent of a kind of moral free-for-all in which it seemed you could say or do anything. It amounted to a very clear, if necessary corrective – and a deliberate dismantling of social control. Now it appears Britain is returning to a state in which speech and morality are to be policed once again, but in a different way – by one’s employer, but also by the mob, empowered by social media.\nProfessor Tombs believes that in many ways it is rather like Foucault’s Pendulum – it goes backwards and forwards, but because the earth is turning it never quite goes backwards and forwards in the same place. So we’ve had swings towards periods of licence – the 18th century was a time of relative freedom owing to the revolutionary movements – but then swings back to a period of repression during the Victorian period; then the swing of the 1960s, in some ways like the 18th century, with people determined to assert their liberties again.\nSo now we’re experiencing a swing back to a period of Neo-Victorianism. Whereas the Victorian working classes were kept pretty much under control – through quite a lot of harassment of one sort or another i.e. by the police, by their neighbours, by their workmates, by charities (the Victorian equivalent of today’s NGOs) – we see similar things happening now. The ‘do gooder’ class – which in Victorian times would have seen the Lady Bountiful visiting the poor and telling them that they have to smarten themselves up and not drink so much – is now echoed by the censoriousness of the descendants of the Victorian middle classes. Now as then, these are the people largely running the country – and our universities have been turned into what the historian Rafe Heydel- Mankoo refers to as ‘woke madrasas’, churning out their highly-politically correct indoctrinated graduates.\nThe 1990s was a period when people could say very much what they liked in public forums without being castigated for their views or censored in the same way they are today, so perhaps this was a utopian period for freedom of speech and belief in the benefits of open debate. Now, we are witnessing a puritan streak in moral progressivism. We have the likes of Greta Thunberg and her climate protests, the climate activist group Just Stop Oil, and the pro-Palestinian protestors and other contemporary radical causes are all morphing into one – what can be described as a kind of all-encompassing ‘omnicause’, with some commentators viewing these activists and their actions as seeking the destruction of Western civilisations.\nIt can be argued that these are simply youthful rebellions – no different to the rockers, the hippies, the punks etc. who have all challenged the estanblishment and come and gone before. Whilst the modern-day woke Puritans are currently in the ascendant, there are positive signs that Western Civilisation is being regenerated. Because the omnicause in Britain is so much hated by the increasingly vocal silent majority for its destructiveness and seeming hostility to the country’s historic values and traditions, there are now signs of green shoots of push back against these ultra-liberal progressives.\nThis might be evidenced by the fact that already across Europe there has been a swing from left of centre to right of centre parties – as witnessed in Sweden, Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands. The National Rally in France under its charismatic 28-year-old leader new president, Jordan Bardella, along with other far-right parties in Europe, are also poised to do well in the European Parliament elections in June.\nThe Netherlands, in particular, is a very positive development vis a vis mass migration. Fed up with untrammelled immigration’s impact on their country, the mainstream Dutch voters gave Geert Wilders a shock election victory. After some months of haggling, a coalition government has now been formed under an agreement which will not see a four-party coalition saying it will try to put in place the “strictest-ever asylum regime”. This will involve stronger border controls and harsher rules for asylum seekers who arrive in the country. To achieve this, the pact says that an opt-out clause for European asylum and migration policies will be submitted as soon as possible to the European Commission. And despite the EU’s new migration pact, the bloc is facing growing demands from more than half of its member states to allow them to control their own migration policies and asking for the right to introduce Rwanda-style deportation schemes.\nSo for many of us in Britain it seems we’re in a waiting game. We will probably come to see a Labour government that will continue to aid and abet the omnicause, and as such this will stimulate many – those who have so far sat on the sidelines – to actively stand up to protect those values, traditions and beliefs that they hold dear. We are already seeing this in the growth of think tanks like the New Culture Forum and an increased interest in parties like Reform and the SDP, those which are much more nationalistic – in the good sense, in terms of pride in country for its ways, culture and achievevments – than the two main parties.\nIn our society we are have to constantly seek a balance between liberty and licence. Whilst for now it has swung much more towards the latter – and so it’s repression and moral censoriousness for the time being – events being played in Europe show there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe future of British Politics is the Social Democratic Party there is little enthusiasm for Keir Starmer or Rishi Sunak both parties are on the way out\nVery eloquently put.\nThe Tories and Labour are politically bankrupt. Vacuous.The same old duopoly. Both are currently selling slightly different shades of stodgy, techno-cratic centrism. I just hope that Starmer (who has absolutely zero following in the country) realises that he will achieve power not because of his winning personality/policies/platform but only because the Tories have failed. The electorate are voting Labour by default and not because they have been entranced by Sir Keir’s ideas (whatever they are) Sadly, the political system with its 19th century voting system and an unreformed upper chamber is designed to protect the duopoly not the people of our country.\nJust signed up for the newsletters.\nHaving read the Election Manifesto and other comments as above, I now feel that the SDP is the only Party I could probably vote for. I suspect where I live, that might mean the PPC and a few others, that’s ok with me(for now)",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_there-is-no-mandate-for-another-referendum/content_13.html": "Having failed to achieve an overall SNP majority in the recent Scottish Parliament election, Nicola Sturgeon was forced to postpone her political manoeuvrings for a second independence referendum which now routinely follows every election her party contests. However, the finalisation of a cooperation agreement with the pro-independence Scottish Greens has brought this grace period to an end and plunged us back into the constitutional turmoil which perpetually plagues Scottish politics.\nAny hopes that independence would take a back seat until Scotland had recovered from the pandemic, as promised by the SNP in May, were dashed upon the release of the “shared policy programme” that accompanied the new quasi-coalition. The first pledge of this document was to “secure a referendum on Scottish independence” within the first two years of the new parliament. This was predictably followed by the First Minister’s proclamation that she now had an “undeniable” mandate for a second referendum, and the announcement that civil servants were to start working on a new case for independence.\nThe SNP face a major issue in attempting to translate the pro-independence majority in the Scottish parliament to a mandate for another referendum. Notably, the party did not campaign on a clear pro-referendum platform during the election.\nInstead, sensibly, they chose to focus on Nicola Sturgeon’s pandemic leadership and the recovery that was to come, with the independence question taking a backseat. This was shown clearly in the final debate of the campaign when Glenn Campbell pushed the first minister, saying “they don’t want another independence referendum during the period of the recovery, so what are they meant to do? If they want you as First Minister but don’t want independence?” Nicola Sturgeon replied clearly “they should vote for me.”\nIt is not that SNP voters were unaware of the party’s support for independence in May, to claim that would be absurd. However there is a clear disparity between the set of priorities used to bait voters during the election campaign and the set of priorities the SNP have switched to in power. Not only does this dishonesty destroy the argument for a second referendum, it also undermines Scottish democracy.\nThis is understood by the electorate. Recent polling that shows only 12% of Scots think independence is amongst the countries most important issues, with the COVID recovery, NHS, economy and jobs all ranked as more important. Another poll shows that only 38% of Scottish people believe there should be another referendum within the First Minister’s timescale of 2 years, with 52% opposed to this plan.\nDuring the May election Nicola Sturgeon also rubbished Alex Salmond’s idea for an “independence supermajority”, labelling it as an attempt to “game the system” for his new Alba party. In this assertion the First Minister was, for once, correct. Using parties that do not seriously contest the constituency votes to achieve a majority cannot seriously be taken as popular support for independence.\nSince then the First Minister seems to have had a rapid change of heart on the issue. She now argues that the Greens’ support gives her a clear mandate for a second referendum despite the fact that only 68% of those likely to vote Green on the list in May supported independence. Both parties using these unscrupulous political tactics underscores the notion that they have no interest in representing the will of the Scottish people, only twisting it to fit their agenda.\nThis distortion of Scotland’s political will continues when we compare how votes cast converted to seats won at the last election. The Scottish Government pushes their parliamentary majority into the spotlight at every opportunity. What they prefer to hide is that even when combined their parties only received 49% and 48.4% of votes on the constituency and regional ballots respectively. No serious democrat can demand another referendum when it was Scotland’s electoral system, not the Scottish people, which delivered this government’s majority.\nWith all of these factors considered, and the polls showing a clear majority for remaining in the UK, it is hard to see the Scottish government’s second referendum push as anything but desperate, cynical and ideologically driven. Despite this, the major UK political parties have failed to offer a serious critique of this nationalist narrative. In pushing back, supporters of the Union must not hide behind the “once in a generation” comfort blanket argument. Instead it must be clearly detailed to voters why Scotland has not given a democratic mandate for another referendum, and why they shouldn’t fall for Nicola Sturgeon’s sleight of hand separatism.\nSadly, there are a lot of so-called democrats who only believe in democracy when elections or referendums give them the result they seek.\nPlease support the idea of the UK becoming Federalist it works well enough in other Countries why not here after two years of Johnson violating our freedoms and rights over a virus that Will not kill every person in the world we need a codified written constitution like that Germany has\nAgree fully !

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_policies_transgender-and-biological-sex-based-rights/content_6.html": "Sex-Based Rights\nThe liberal pursuit of individual autonomy and desire must be balanced by the common good. Some citizens feel at odds with the physiology and social role associated with their natal sex and can suffer distress. Transgender people should be treated with dignity and respect, in keeping with their acquired gender in most situations. However, these rights must be balanced against the need of natal females for safety and sporting fairness. Biological sex is real and politically significant. This requires an absolute stance on relevant legal definitions in some domains.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- We support segregation by biological sex in sport. Fair competition is not secured if male-bodied transgender athletes are permitted to compete in women’s sport and, in the case\nof contact sports, the risk of injury can increase significantly.\n- We support segregation by biological sex in prisons and women’s refuges in order to safeguard the safety and privacy of natal females. Separate prisons or prison accommodation should be provided for transgender citizens to ensure their safety and privacy.\n- Transgender individuals wishing to change their sex marker should be allowed to do so. However, we support the continued necessity for medical gatekeeping in any legal change of sex marker. We oppose proposals that would allow someone to change their sex marker by self-identification only.\n- The Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act will be amended to ensure that sex-based\nrights which require protection in key domains are not undermined by a change in sex\nmarker.\n- Healthcare spending and resources for gender dysphoric individuals, including long-term psychological intervention, should be provided at sufficient levels. Physical or drug-based medical treatments for gender dysphoria should be prohibited for anyone under 18 years of age.\n- We support the retention of biological sex and gender identity as distinct categories in public sector data gathering such as crime statistics, poverty metrics or public health research.\n- We support the use of plain English for discussions of biological sex in health and reproductive care.",

He argues that Britain needs a robust civic patriotism which understands that a stable family unit is the best form of social security.\nThe SDP rejects the current obsession with grievance and identity which divides our society into hostile and opposing camps. We favour strengthening the common bonds which unite us and, in so doing, reinforcing communitarian impulses in public life. Our policies seek to defend and support traditional family life, particularly in welfare and economic policy, education and housing.\nRakib and William discuss the impacts of tribal identity politics on social cohesion, and identify the steps that need to be taken to create a more unified and tolerant society.",

Ultimately, we aim to remove dependence on subsidies by aiding transition to more profitable farming methods and ensuring producers are paid a fair price, but support will be guaranteed for as long as needed.\n- We will invest in agricultural technology and farmer-led research and innovation to make high-yield farming less environmentally damaging and small-scale farming more efficient.\n- At least 90% of existing farmland will be maintained for agriculture. Nature restoration projects will be targeted to non-food producing land and least-productive farmland. Best and most versatile farmland will be protected from all other land use types.\n- Through tax incentives and planning reform we will reverse the decline in small farms and restore diversity of farm size across the UK. A land acquisition scheme funded by inheritance tax will be used to create new market gardens, orchard villages, small farms and smallholdings. We will prohibit the sale of county farms by local authorities, and prevent the sale of any food-producing land to non-UK citizens or entities.\n- Community Housing Groups will be established to provide affordable housing in rural areas ring-fenced for local working families. We will reverse decades of economic neglect to reinvigorate rural communities through investment in infrastructure, mobile and broadband connectivity, public transport and policing.\n- We will re-establish land-based colleges and invest in apprenticeships and mentoring schemes to facilitate access to farming, forestry, horticulture and other rural careers. The integration of food and farming into the school curriculum will be strengthened and will include farm visits and practical home economics and cooking classes.\n- Trade deals will not be allowed to disadvantage British farmers and food producers. A Buy British policy will be adopted for public sector procurement, with an emphasis on local sourcing. Both raw and processed foods will carry clear country of origin and animal welfare labelling.\n- We will support the establishment of regional Charter Co-operatives and marketing boards, enabling farmers, food producers and retailers to work together to process and sell food locally at viable prices. The Charter Co-op scheme will make healthy food universally available and affordable. We will establish infrastructure grants to improve the resilience and sustainability of local food networks.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-not-so-beautiful-game/content_8.html": "To social conservatives and communitarians, the public reaction to the abortive plans of Europe’s leading football clubs to form a ‘Super League’ were depressingly familiar. The announcement prompted expressions of outrage from fans, pundits and even the Prime Minister, and eventually strangled the league in the cradle. All of this was bizarre, because the things they were complaining about already pervaded every aspect of football. A breakaway Super League would have changed the official rules, but little of football’s reality. Stopping this move will ultimately mean nothing, as the war for football’s soul was lost years ago.\nIt started in 1983. Before then, clubs in the Football League (which comprised the top four divisions of the English league pyramid) were obliged to pay their opponents 20% of their match day gate receipts. This allowed smaller clubs to enjoy the financial benefits of playing at Old Trafford, Anfield or Villa Park once a season, somewhat evening the playing field between the larger and smaller clubs.\nUnder the guise of fostering a more commercially minded approach to the game, in 1983, the big clubs successfully pressured the Football League into removing the gate-sharing agreement. Now, the bigger clubs would get to keep their entire match day revenue. This gave them an advantage in the transfer market they had not previously enjoyed.\nManchester United’s 1989 signing of Paul Ince from West Ham United was a good example. Previously, West Ham had prided themselves on being able to keep their best homegrown talent. But in 1989, representatives from Old Trafford turned up at Upton Park and blasted anything West Ham could pay Ince out of the water.\nThis transfer market advantage bought the top clubs more success, and thus more lobbying power. In 1992, led by ‘the Big Five’, the top flight of English football broke away from the Football League to form the Premier League. The main difference was that the Premier League would negotiate its own television rights, and keep the money itself, with only token redistribution to the rest of the professional game. Before that, television revenue had been shared equally between the 92 clubs in the league.\nThis concentrated yet more money, and thus spending muscle, within the larger clubs, and made them even more powerful. The same year, UEFA changed the format and branding of its European Cup. Since 1955, it had been a straight knockout tournament including the previous season’s winners of each of Europe’s leagues. From 1992, it would be called ‘the Champion’s League’ and involve a league stage that preceded a knockout phase.\nThe idea was to prevent clubs from being eliminated in the first round after only one European home game. Reaching the league stage guaranteed three. Further, the television and sponsorship revenues would be channelled primarily toward Champions League clubs, rather than divided between the three UEFA club tournaments.\nOver time, Europe’s biggest clubs pushed UEFA into broadening the tournament to ensure more guaranteed matches and a greater likelihood that the big clubs from the major TV markets would qualify every season. This diverted evermore of the game’s money, and spending power, towards the larger clubs.\nThe establishment of the Champions League and Premier League coincided with renewed public interest in football. Television executives realised that sport had an unrivalled ability to generate advertising revenue, and so came the advent of “pay television.” This meant that the big clubs were not simply taking a bigger slice of the pie; they were taking a bigger slice of a pie that was getting larger at an astonishing speed.\nThis breakneck accumulation of money attracted the interest of global financiers, sports magnates and the super wealthy as surely as dumping a pale of bloody fish heads into the ocean lures sharks. The families who had held stakes in British football clubs for generations were suddenly able to sell them for hundreds of millions of pounds. The Hill-Wood family had been involved with Arsenal F.C. since the 1920s, and eventually sold to the moneymen in the mid-2000s. The Moores family sold to American investors at around the same time, after having owned controlling stakes in Liverpool F.C. for half a century.\nIn a saner world, the clubs would not have been theirs to sell. The existing owners would have been seen rather as custodians, running the clubs to ensure their longevity for the fans and communities that had built and sustained them. Indeed, the original FA rules restricted dividends to 5% of the face value of the shares, prohibited the payment of directors, and said that if a club were wound up, any surplus had to be given to charity or another club. Owners were simply not expected to gain financial reward for their involvement in the game. Now, they made unfathomable fortunes selling to sheiks with briefcases full of cash and to plutocrats who funded their deals by loading the clubs they bought with debt.\nNobody cared about any of this. On the contrary, most of the pundits who spent much of last week mewling on Sky Sports about the European Super League once celebrated the massive injection of cash into the top tier football – be it from the Premier League’s ever richer television deals, the Champions League’s development into an virtual closed shop for the big clubs, or mega-rich club owners.\nHow many of those complaining can honestly say they felt similar outrage when ticket hyperinflation meant the working class fans who sustained the clubs for a century were suddenly priced out of the game? How many campaigned against the vast sums of debt piled onto clubs’ balance sheets? Who cared about the disparity between the top five or six clubs in England and the rest, or between the Premier League and many other leagues in Europe?\nWhere was the outrage about club money being funneled into the pockets of an small group of club owners and players, rather than being spread around to help the game as a whole and the communities the clubs serve?\nTo argue English and European football is still meritocratic because it has promotion and relegation is like saying Russia is a democracy because it holds elections. Consider Manchester United. In 1969, Sir Matt Busby, a great manager who had been in charge for decades, retired. The club made a series of poor managerial appointments and blunders on the transfer market. Eventually, they were relegated to what is now the Championship. When Sir Alex Ferguson retired, the club made the same mistakes, but this time the weight of finance was so heavily in its favour that the extent of its fall was to seventh place.\nThe rules still permit relegation, but the facts on the ground do not. Smaller teams still have a chance to play a superclub, but are given no realistic chance of winning in the end. In other words, the proposed European Super League was simply an effort to codify reality.\nIn this sense, football reflects our economy. Like many businesses that were privatised or deregulated in the 1980s, football clubs have become unmoored from their communities and purpose. Craven regulatory authorities and an indifferent government allowed them to be sold to rapaciously greedy foreign investors, and be thence transformed from organisations sustained by their communities into corporations that exist to maximise the returns on their shareholders’ capital at the expense of everything else.\nUnlike the broader economy, football now has a second chance. The failure of the ESL offers us a chance to clip the wings of the superclubs and their rapacious owners. Central to any effort to reform football must be an understanding that the clubs serve their fans and communities, and that genuine competitiveness drives interest.\nMoving to a German model, in which fans own a 50% and greater share of the clubs, might seem ideal, but it is difficult to see how that could happen given that clubs are all limited companies. Either the government would have to expropriate the present owners, or stump up big money to nationalise them. Neither is politically realistic. However, fan societies could and should be given seats on their clubs’ boards of directors.\nWe should return to the pre-1983 model in which 20% of gate receipts were shared, and television royalties were equitably shared between the four divisions. Champions League money must be rolled into this, too, given the riches involved.\nIf we returned to a state in which clubs were more closely connected to their communities than their shareholders, and any team had a strong chance of beating any other on any given Saturday, we might find we enjoyed it more.\nVery good summary of how it is and what needs to be done.\nNow make it happen people…its up to all football fans to tackle this now.\nI think the first step is for people to realise the truth. At present, the defeat of the European Super League is being treated as a huge victory for fan power. However, it changes nothing. We still have a monstrously uncompetitive League that basically allows the big clubs to win everything by weight of transfer spending. The new Champions League rules for next season, for instance, aren’t too far away from the closed shop ESL proposal. Manchester United could finish sixth, yet qualify ahead of a league winner from a smaller TV market, or a more deserving English team.\nExcellent pieve Andrew.\nMuch appreciated, William. Thank you\nExcellent analysis.\nWon’t hold my breath on any changes happening though sadly.\nVery kind words, tank you. And you’re right. Alas, I fear that what will happen is that the failure of the ESL will come to be seen as a great victory for fan power, and we’ll go on as we were before.\nSpot on, thanks\nThank you. Very kind.\nExcellent article, thank you. But while I find it persuasive, there are some difficult facts to deal with. While the game might’ve been financially equitable pre-1992, it had problems we don’t miss: low attendances, hooliganism, terrible pitches and stadiums. The greed has brought some good.\nThese are fair criticisms, and I would have dealt with them in the article, but it was long already.\nYou are right that football had terrible problems in the 80s, and it was badly affecting the viability of the clubs. However, I do not believe that the EPL and UEFA CL greed solved those problems. First, policing and CCTV was and would have continued anyway to have an effect on hooliganism. Secondly, the Taylor Report meant that grounds were going to be redeveloped into all-seater, new stadia anyway. Thirdly, the popularity of the Italia 90 World Cup saw renewed interest in football, as did Sky’s involvement. All this would have brought more money in the game. The tragedy is that it was funneled to a few big clubs, rather than being spread around the game.\nPersuasive and interesting – thanks. But what of the game pre-1992, with its small crowds, hooligans, terrible pitches and stadiums? The greed has brought much good\nA good article, but what about Bosman which has given untold riches to players and their agents, it is the drive for success which has caused the clubs involved in the ESL to incur massive debt to buy players and pay their exorbitant wages (incidentally to transfer fees do trickle down). Now they want to protect their income and remain permanently on the gravy train, it is not unsurprising that three of the English clubs are owned by Americans whose major sports follow the franchise system with no promotion or relegation.\nNo mention of the footballing authorities who singularly fail to move with the times and ignore many of the pleas of fans. These “Blazers” appear to be in the sport for their self in port, basking in the perceived glory the glory of finals and international tournaments, whilst ignoring the demands of the fans. When has anyone heard the FA talk about VAR problems, the International breaks that football supporters hate, when has anyone heard a referee explain their actions? I challenge you to ask a simple question of the FA , see how difficult that is, see if you ever get a response. What influence does a football fan have in the game they love, how are FA members elected?\nSo yes ownership needs addressing, as does player power and the football governing bodies.\nRegarding the Bosman ruling. Yes, it did give more money to players — although once clubs realised its implications and got themselves organised, they realised they had to sign players to extensions at least a year before the left (usually two) so they would avoid losing them in free-transfers. Furthermore, their accountancy practices now account for that. They book a signing as an asset (say, you buy a player for 20 million, you book that 20 million as an asset on your balance sheet) and then amortise the amount over the length of the contact (over a five year contract, the value of the asset falls by 4 million a year, in this example). That means that their accounts aren’t affected too much. Further, if there was less money among the big clubs, there’d just be less money for players and agents. That’s what people don’t get: a lot of the increased TV revenue doesn’t touch the clubs. It literally goes to players and agents, almost directly. The clubs therefore never have enough, because no matter how much more they get, an equal amount goes in signings, agets fees and wages. It’s unsustainable.\nWhen will British clubs start being owned by it’s supporters like the German bundesliga clubs are, and why is bumbling Boris, chinless Dowden,and just William sticking their noses in get their own houses in order first",

The tax-free threshold is inherited by a surviving spouse and rises to £500,000 if the beneficiary is a child or grandchild, meaning that no tax is paid on the first £1m inherited by direct descendants of a married couple.\nOver £7 billion per year is raised through inheritance tax, which is spent on public services.\nThe Conservative Party are said to be considering abolishing inheritance tax entirely as part of their next general election manifesto. Is it reasonable for parents to expect to build up wealth and pass it on tax-free, or would this simply entrench existing inequalities?\nWilliam and Michael explore the practical and ethical problems with this proposal.\nMy suggestion is to move to an accessions tax where individuals are given lifetime inheritance allowances of, say, £250k. This would include anything that they have inherited so far in their lives. Above the allowance, individuals would be taxed at a rate of 40% and they would declare what they have inherited in an annual tax return. When they make their first declaration, they would declare all historical inheritances, large capital transfers and gifts.\nOne option is to retain Inheritance Tax as an ‘Advance Accessions Tax’ applied at 40% on an entire estate, with beneficiaries using their annual tax return to reclaim the 40% tax, if they have qualifying inheritance allowance available.\nThe benefit of this reform would be encouraging redistribution through people’s own decisions to spread their estates to multiple beneficiaries, with the option to prioritise people who have not inherited much before. Special provision would be made to allow genuine family businesses to be passed on as going concerns, with taxation deferred until future sale.",

The two-party duopoly – locked in by the first past the post voting system – is harming our nation, stifling political competition and denying new entrants a chance to contribute. Meanwhile, England – the United Kingdom’s largest nation – lacks the democratic voice granted to all others. The House of Lords remains an unreformed chamber of political appointees and the nation remains fettered by outdated post-war international protocols.

The devolved parliaments of England, Wales and Scotland will have powers equivalent to, but not greater than, those of the current Scottish Parliament.\n- Westminster parliamentary elections will be conducted under system of proportional representation comprising multi-member geographically based constituencies using the D’Hondt voting method.\n- The Human Rights Act will be replaced by a new Bill of Rights drawing upon the British tradition of liberty, free speech and free association and incorporating established principles such as Habeas Corpus and the rule of law. The Supreme Court will be abolished and the Law Lords reintroduced.\n- The House of Lords will be reformed. Hereditary Peers and the Lords Spiritual will be removed and the system of political honours abolished. A new independent nominations commission will appoint a house of 400 peers to serve for a maximum of 15 years with selection criteria to include political balance, competence and capacity to function in a revised upper chamber.\n- We will withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Council of Europe, the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and all other international instruments which deny UK border sovereignty.\n- Political and economic power shall be further decentralised via existing devolved regional bodies and the creation of additional such entities within geographically and culturally coherent areas.

Ironically, for liberal centrists that purport to despise populism, this is exactly that, designed to prompt a visceral response. It’s also a tool for crude humour (see title). The truth of the matter is not as clear cut. Yet again, it is a distortion the usual suspects want to become gospel, without anyone questioning it.\nWhy is sewage being released? Sewage is usually sent to treatment plants where it is filtered and treated in three stages. The solids and bacteria are removed, leaving water which (although not fit for human consumption) is clean enough to release into the sea and rivers. Treated solids are used as fertiliser and burned to generate electricity. However, this process is not always possible.\nThe problem is nearly half of England’s sewers are ‘combined’. This means both sewage and rainwater go into them, and thus it is easier for the system to be overwhelmed, especially during heavy rainfall. This is made worse with the problem of ‘fatbergs’ and the tendency for people to flush away items like wet-wipes. When the system is overloaded there is not the capacity or the time for the sewage to be treated. In order to stop it bursting into the street and up through our toilets, it has to be released into bodies of water where in theory it will disperse. Should it happen, ideally? Of course not – but it is certainly preferable to towns full of effluent.\nIn the Victorian era, when these sewers were built, the population was much smaller. Indeed for some while there was no technology to treat effluent at all, nor the ecological and medical concerns about discharging into waterways. Thus separating rain and effluent was not considered. It wasn’t until 1858 after the ‘Great Stink’ of London that sewers were built to take the effluent out of cities. The combined sewer approach continued until the 1960s, when all new sewers were built to separate wastewater. With these systems, the rainwater is immediately released into waterways but the pipes containing sewage go to the treatment plants.\nAfter a half-century of mass immigration (skyrocketing in 1997), sewers – combined or otherwise – are seriously overstretched. Therefore the need to discharge sewage in emergencies is more frequent. With record immigration numbers of over a million people a year it will only continue. Of course we could fully replace the remaining combined sewers, and in time we should. However the cost is estimated to be at least £150 billion, according to the Storm Overflows Taskforce. A House of Lords report has the true figure at £350 to £600 billion. With the current setup this would inevitably be passed onto the consumer through their water bills. The price does not only include building the new pipes, but also the cost of digging up the old ones and everything built on top of them. As well as the practical costs, the legal costs and compensation would be astronomical. To put the price tag into context, HS2 and renewing Trident are costing well over £100 billion each and the Covid spend was north of £300 billion.\nEvery time Labour or other parties promise to solve the problem, we must then ask if they intend to replace those pre-1960s pipes, and how they intend to pay for it. We could also ask why the last Labour governments did not perform the necessary upgrades. After all, they began the unprecedented immigration which exacerbates the problem so.\nCombined sewers are not particular to our squalid ‘plague island’. Countries all around the world have them, and there are 333,000 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in Europe. England has 14,500. As a result the EU have intervened against most of its member states on effluent pollution multiple times, including the UK while we were in the bloc. However, in 2012 the ECJ did rule that releasing of sewage was allowed in exceptional circumstances.\nAs the usual suspects will delight in telling you, there is indeed data that shows increasing numbers of sewage discharges, and this goes up significantly since 2016. In 2016, 12,637 incidents were detected. In 2022 there were 301,091. However, the reason for this is that much more monitoring now happens. In 2016, only 5% of CSOs were checked. Now 91% are scrutinised, thus the numbers are higher.\nIndeed if it was down to Brexit, then how come the releases were increasing between 2016 and 2020, before we had actually left? And why did they then decline after 2020 once we had departed? In 2020 there were 403,375 and in 2022 there were 301,091.\nThere are only two tenuous aspects linking the issue to Brexit. Firstly, by definition the government is freer to make decisions on sewage policy without fearing punishment from the EU’s courts. That doesn’t mean they want to release more, but like all policy areas the government can now be more flexible. Secondly, after the pandemic there was a shortage of chemicals needed to treat sewage. This included ferric sulphate, much of which is produced in the EU, with four EU countries among the top exporters (2021). Many goods saw shortages, price-rises and logistical problems in that period, and still do. The shortage of lorry drivers – many of whom had retired during Covid – was a major factor, compounded by a sluggish DVLA. Brexit was only a small element exacerbating these issues, with the increased paperwork and non-tariff barriers for imports/exports.\nAs a result of the chemical shortages and heavy rainfall in the summer of 2021 the government adopted a different approach towards the water companies. There has long been a system of permits allowing companies to release sewage, issued for specific CSOs. Firms are only allowed to do so in certain situations stipulated in that licence – usually heavy rainfall. In normal circumstances if they dump effluent outside of those terms they are fined.\nHowever, because of the difficult scenario, on September 1 2021 the government announced that if a firm could not get the necessary chemicals it would be allowed to release sewage outside of the terms of its permit. It would however be required to get written agreement to do so. The move only applied to sewage that had been through two stages of treatment, rather than the normal three. The temporary arrangement was terminated in January 2022, and we returned to the established permit system.\nEmergency releases were also an issue discussed in the Environment Bill, introduced in 2021. The bill was concerned with bringing sewage discharges and pollution down. It obliged the Environment Secretary to intervene in these matters and required public transparency about releases. With the passage of the bill through Parliament, a Tory peer, Lord Wellington, proposed an amendment to legally require companies to bring down the amounts they were releasing.\nThe government initially rejected this amendment when the bill went back to the Commons, whipping its MPs to do so. This prompted a huge amount of performative outrage from the opposition parties and their allies online. ‘Tory Sewage Party’ became the online hashtag, with ‘Tories just voted to dump sewage on our beaches’ the only detail you needed to know. The usual celebrity figures pushed this endlessly.\nThe government’s reasoning was that the need for emergency discharges was too great, and therefore frequent fines would be too costly for the water companies, with these losses passed onto the customer. You can object to the stance and consider it soft, perhaps even believe there is an element of corruption or collusion with the private firms. However it is dishonest to overlook the progressive nature of the Environment Bill, the fact emergency sewage releases are sometimes necessary because of the infrastructure, and the fact that Labour won’t commit to fixing it.\nBecause of the political backlash over the amendment, the government decided to draft a similar amendment of its own to compensate – another factor that is overlooked. With this written in, the bill went through and was signed into law. Labour still tries to come up with essentially hollow opposition bills to keep hammering home the ‘Tory sewage party’ narrative.\nAs the data about emergency releases is misleading, so too is that concerning water quality in rivers. 14% of England’s rivers were deemed to have ‘good’ ecological status in 2023 – ahead of Germany’s 8% and Holland’s 4%. The scale is set by the EU Water Framework Directive, enacted in 2009 to monitor bodies of water across the continent of Europe. England’s score (as with other countries) has declined since 2009 – it was 25% in that year and 16% in 2015. However this is largely because the EU’s standards went up in that time. They increased the list of substances required to be tested for in 2015. Even then sewage does not count for much of the increase (36% according to Ofwat). Nitrogen and phosphorous from agriculture is a bigger factor (40%). Urban and transport pollution is also a significant contributor (18%).\nRivers are not only graded on ‘ecological’, but also ‘chemical’ status. Biased articles are keen to point out that none of England’s rivers managed to score ‘good’ on both counts. Out of 3,740 rivers, 75% were rated ‘moderate’ with 21% ‘poor’ and 4% ‘bad’. ‘Moderate’ grading is hardly much to boast about, but it could be worse.\nEngland is the outlier in the United Kingdom. In Scotland and Wales respectively, 66% and 45% of rivers are at overall ‘good’ standard. In Northern Ireland, 52% of ‘inshore coastal waterbodies’ are good or above. Of course, England has a much larger population, surface area (meaning more rainfall and agricultural runoff) and has more industry. Commonly, the usual suspects also blame England’s lower standards on its privatised water companies, and uphold the other UK constituents as poster children for public ownership.\nEngland is indeed the only nation in the world to have a fully privatised water industry, which has been the case since 1989. The government retains regulatory overview through the Environment Agency, but the water companies own the infrastructure and deliver the service.\nI believe that water should be in the full control of the state, and thus under the scrutiny of the voters. It doesn’t make sense for private companies and the markets to be entrusted in something that is a basic need of life and society. They will always prioritise profit over performance, especially as they are monopolies. On top of that nationalisation would provide secure job opportunities as well as government revenue (once the billions are spent buying out the private companies, that is). Nationalisation, however, is not necessarily a panacea. It still requires competence, proper funding and transparency. Neither would it solve the current problem of combined sewers – the time and money to fix this will still have to come from somewhere, no matter who is running the show.\nIndeed, despite the public ownership, combined sewers are still in operation in the home nations – they have 7,000 CSOs between them and these are in regular use. There is also less investment than in England, and proportionally more clean water leaks. Between 2020 and 2025 England invested more in water infrastructure than any other nation in Europe.\nBoth rivers and beaches have vastly improved since the bad old days. The UK meets the average of the EU – 93% of bathing waters were rated excellent. It was 70% in 2009 and was around 45% in the 1990s. Of course, we do not want to go backwards on any of these issues. Sewage releases continuing or increasing will jeopardise this record. It is therefore essential to deal with the increasing population, the dated infrastructure and any supply chain problems. As with other products, we should be able to make the treatment chemicals we need ourselves, and we should rebuild British manufacturing. Wet-wipes should be banned as planned and solutions to fat disposal should be found. Nationalisation should at least be considered, and tried out in some areas to prove its efficacy.\nThe purpose of this article is not to downplay the problems in our sewage system and our waters or to belittle peoples’ genuine concerns. Wanting a country as free as possible from pollution is noble. Nobody would dispute the need for a clean and safe environment, to be enjoyed by wildlife and our descendants. However, the current framing of the issue is often dishonest and political. It doesn’t consider the realities of our infrastructure, the (lack of) policies of all previous governments, the international context, the flaws in the statistics or what the proper solution must be. It simply says to the uninformed voter ‘this is bad and the fault of the Tories’ – not ‘your house will fill with effluent if we don’t discharge sewage elsewhere’.\nIt is yet another parlour game to propel the Labour Party into power and blame the Brexit that the liberal establishment and deep state wants to cancel. The type of people pushing the narrative will always blame the government, conservativism and Brexit, because all they are interested in is their agenda. It is the duty of fair-minded people to call this simplistic framing out wherever we see it. To engage, wearily, in some crude populist humour: we’ve got to cut the crap.\nYou can read more of Ed Pond’s writing here:\nThat’s all really interesting. Thank you.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_from-europhile-to-brexiteer/content_372.html": "I used to be a card-carrying Europhile.\nI had travelled the world declaring myself a Londoner, British and European as Europhiles still like to boast today.\nMaybe I didn’t want to see my political views morphing.\nHowever, almost imperceptively, they were.\nFor years and with growing distaste, I observed how EU leaders were becoming more remote from their citizens, exemplified in the perfunctory way they brushed aside referendum and election results that were inconvenient to ‘the European project’.\nStudying economics gave me another shove in the direction of what came to be known as Brexit.\nOnce you understand the basics you realise how utterly bonkers the Euro is. No sane person would have created it because it was obvious it wouldn’t work. Plenty did warn about it but were brushed aside. Again they were inconvenient to ‘the project’. Like any ideology true believers rarely want things like facts to get in the way.\nThis all came to a head with the Eurozone crisis.\nThe ‘facts’ of the crisis are well known. It was a standard morality tale as told by the North. The South had run up debts it could not repay which required the frugal well-run Northern members to come in and sort it out.\nHowever the most important facts concerned dysfunctional governance across much of the south, lying bankers and politicians at all levels, misaligned currency exchange rates, differing real interest rates and a wall of money from northern countries’ trade surpluses searching for a yield.\nYou can see why the morality tale is so convenient. Everyone understands greed. However what I saw was democracy and millions of people lives being stamped on daily.\nI watched expert after expert use the technical term ‘internal devaluation’ as the solution to the South’s problems. This is the simple, cruel idea that to make a country competitive you need to bring down wages and remove social protections.\nIt is exactly what the EU did in Spain, Greece, Portugal and even Ireland.\nThe way the EU stamped down on democracy when it got in the way of ‘the project’ and the damn currency was, if anything, worse.\nI watched two democratically elected heads of state forced out of office by the European Central Bank (ECB), an election in Greece ignored and both Ireland and Greece forced via the barrel of an EU-created banking crisis to take bailouts which their grandchildren would have to pay back. Elected politicians and governments were put to the sword for daring to argue.\nThere are no words to fully describe the terrible treatment meted out by the EU to people they are meant to care for.\nPerhaps the saddest part is the way so many people still parrot back the same old morality tale, such is the power of this simple story. The facts are there but people don’t want to see them. That would challenge their new religion. And that is discomforting. I guess I can understand that.\nAs for the EU, it got to keep its currency and project a while longer and, well, if people had to suffer then so be it. But for me it was the beginning of the end of my support.\nLike Daniel I was a supporter of the so called European project of greater co operation between states to halt the possibilities of another European war. Who could not support such a project. However the project became caught up with its own hubris and from co operation to a project of forming a unitary state which could never be achieved. In fact behind this delusion of a single state the dominant trend was for Germany to become the dominant power and all policies were aimed at securing German domination. The cost of this has been human suffering especially in the souther European states. Now Covid comes along and leads to increasing bankruptcy as the cost of lockdowns across Europe was and is astronomical and will lead to bankruptcy of most states.\nOne last point is that this crisis hopefully will lead to the recognition that what is needed are sovereign states committed to a social contract between their citizens and the state to create conditions for capital to thrive while ensuring the vulnerable are supported. A new contract is needed and not the old failed way of doing things.\nbefore Brexit I started to dislike the EU especially the way it treated Greece and the other Nations that got into financial difficulty the EU only benefits Germany or France I actually was once in favour of the EU the Remoaners can go to hell and shove their insults\nChina Virus will accelerate the inevitable collapse of the Euro, Europe, then the EU. A Trading Bloc that attempted to become the United States of Europe, through the backdoor, by disingenuous means.\nThe poem that best describes the EU starts “Come into my parlour, said the spider to the fly…”\nThere used to be an idea called “subsidiarity”, the notion that even within the EU, decsions could be taken at a local level. What ever happened to that ?\nThe SDP has the potential to challenge the tired LibLabConSNP they are becoming more and more unpopular Johnson’s handling of Covid19 is beginning to bite Him all Starmer wants to do is mimic the Tories, the Liberals are irrelevant, and Sturgeon is opportunistically using Covid19 to pursue independence which is a no go\nSo glad to have found you again Dan. You are missed on Twitter.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_david-goodhart-on-how-to-transform-uk-training/content_253.html": "Training. What a turn-off. The very word casts a shadow over the page. That is partly because it has become such a specialised field, awash in hundreds of different programmes producing less and less of what we need as a society. Most policymakers don’t understand it, let alone citizens.\nThe Covid-19 crisis is a chance to change this. The economy is on the point of a great reshaping and if the state can pay the wages of millions it can support the retraining of millions.\nToo much of our education/training spend now goes on 18-19 year olds in higher education doing full-time residential courses lasting three or four years, meaning we over-produce then grade-inflate too many bachelor degrees. One third of graduates are not in graduate jobs, while we suffer debilitating shortages in skilled trades, construction and middle-skill technician jobs (including the vital lab technicians we see on television).\nPeople in policy circles talk endlessly about ‘lifelong learning’, yet adult education and re-education are in freefall and the apprenticeship system is not working for school leavers.\nHere are three ideas for an emergency training package—aimed mainly at non-university bound school-leavers and adult retrainers.\nFirst, an “opportunity grant” of £3,000 for every individual over 21, the money to be drawn down by the providers of approved job-relevant courses. Individuals cannot see the costs and benefits of different courses of action so need an official training map to describe available courses and their costs, the job opportunities after a course, the average pay for that skill etc. The Government could use the map to guide people to skill shortage areas and might offer higher grants for a coder or construction electrician.\nSecond, suspend the current apprenticeship levy and replace it with a simplified model focused on school leavers (less than 10 per cent now enter an apprenticeship) with Government and employers splitting the full cost 50:50. The current levy covers less than one third of the total cost, so employers have used it on discretionary training for older workers.\nGovernment should also promote good training by employers via public procurement rules.\nThird, current bail-out conditions provide Government with leverage to weed out weaker university courses and create a sub-set of ‘applied universities’, undoing the mistaken abolition of polytechnics in 1992. Many post-1992 universities are already largely vocational but Government should insist that they offer courses aimed at a wider range of students: 18 month/two year courses, part-time courses and so on.\nThe UK must remain a global centre of education and research; indeed it should look to develop even further in this direction, but not allow a global focus, especially in higher education, to distract us from sorting out the glaring problems in our own backyard.\nDavid Goodhart’s report A Training Opportunity in the Crisis is available on the Policy Exchange website https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/a-training-opportunity-in-the-crisis/\nYes, agree entirely. Higher education is for many a terrible con job: £40,000 debt for a degree in urban studies from the “University” of Spalding. And no chance of employment. An imposition and a delusion aimed at our poorest kids. Meanwhile, thousands of engineering jobs remain unfilled in the UK because there are too few apprenticeships, too little learning on the job.\nQuite right.\nIt can only be a matter of time before the wholesale debasement of university degrees leads to a ‘buyers strike’.\nI think the above is worthy but it misses the mark. When we were Industrialised we had an effective and efficient system for producing all the engineers, chemists etc which we needed through the ONC/HNC City and Guilds systems operated through the colleges of technology and similar. Doncaster had hundreds of very competent analysts. ( there would have been no difficulty in recruiting the analysts needed for Covid 19 testing then because there were huge numbers of labs and people working in them with the necessary skills.) The system was demanding with day release 9am to 9pm and a further 6 till 9 evening done after work. After Thatcher dismantled our industry the Technical Colleges scrapped these excellent courses. Post HNC there was lots of opportunity to go on to get degrees and degree equivalents via the professional institutions. –Osbourne with his extremely stupid ‘ march of the makers’ idea seemed to have the idea that we could just wave a magic wand and overnight restore the damage to our industrial capacity and the educational systems which underpinned them. Lots of the subsequent training systems set up by private operators were little more than money making rackets which provided very low level skill sets via their training programs.\nSome great ideas, but £3000 may be too much now People have been bumped into doing more online ?\nPart time attendance seems necessary: linked either to part-time online learning, along with decent coaching/ mentoring.\nOr part time éducation with part time work: learning while having real life applications.. as in apprenticeships , but ideally less rigid and less minutely assessed item by item.\nI am also v suspicious of the suggestion that public procurement\nRules should be encouraged: as a Small consultancy we endlessly find perfectly do-able research projects are ruled out by the overheads involved in the tender process. Fine to have procurement principles, but don’t require every bidder to evidence Compliance with every Aspirational requirement: why not allow self declaration, and if you really don’t trust them ask the winning bidder to evidence! I’m not sure what this remark was aiming to address.\nIt is, I think, remarkable that there is an almost complete lack of private coding schools/academies in the UK. We’ve seen that in places like India, the initiative of private coding academies has equipped hundreds of thousands of Indians with core software & coding abilities which we need, but all too often lack.\nThese could initially be ‘summer schools’ for school and student age people. But in addition, I think there would be huge demand from slightly older people who appreciate that right now they really do need to be able to work in Python, C, or at the very least SQL.\nhttps://www.newchartistmovement.org.uk\nMany countries have ideas worth emulating – the recent decision by the Australias – to increase greatly the cost of humanities course whilst lowering the fees for vocational training and STEM courses.\nSingapore subsidises all those who wish to train in medicine – so Drs and nurses receive a bursary whilst training. On completion, they are given a job within the country – for the next 5 years nurses pay back some of the subsidy, Doctors for 7. Then they are given a bonus for staying and go up the pay scale. It means they are less reliant on importing medical staff from abroad. They train and retain their own workers.\nIt may also be worth looking at the Guild system in Germany which allowed Germany to circumvent freedom of movement rules for many trades. In order to operate in many German trades you have to have received your training by the German Guild for that trade. The guild itself pays for the training – then the qualified craftsperson pays a subscription to the guild for the rest of their working life (in that trade) which pays for the training of other apprentices. As a result, standards of work are high, and wages protected from the free market.\nMany good ideas to be had…\nI agree, but there’s a cultural change to be made as well as fiscal. Most people who end up in Further Education accompanied by a sense that they have failed in some way. They are assessed and streamed away from A levels very promptly by schools so they do not affect league tables and schools themselves attach less value to vocational training. In Germany for example, there is no gulf in perception like there is here.\nThe danger of unpicking the polytechnic/quasi university problem is that you create competition between HE and FE colleges. That would be an unfair fight given the chronic uderfunding of FE and the resources of the universities.\nI’m also concerned the government are overcommitted to private sector training providers, who are potentially going to be the beneficiaries of much of the financial stimulus without an effective contribution.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2021_03_29_david-bettney-announced-as-sdp-candidate-for-hartlepool/content_431.html": "29th March, 2021 – The Social Democratic Party (SDP) today announces that David Bettney will be the party’s candidate for the Hartlepool by-election.\nDavid is a former soldier who served in the Army for 22 years, which included operational tours in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. After joining the Army as a Trooper at the age of 17, David rose through the ranks to eventually become a Regimental Sergeant Major in The Light Dragoons, Hartlepool’s local cavalry regiment. Since leaving the Army over a decade ago David has become a serial entrepreneur in the oil and gas industry, having built several construction, logistics and storage companies from the ground-up in the Middle East.\nIn standing as the SDP’s candidate in Hartlepool, David will be offering Hartlepool’s voters the unique chance to vote for a party that is patriotic, willing to invest in public services and determined to bring back jobs and industry.\nDavid Bettney, the SDP’s candidate for Hartlepool, says:\n“Hartlepool is a fantastic town with a wonderful community, and I’m proud that I’ve been chosen by the SDP to stand as its MP. Sadly, despite the potential of this town and its people, Hartlepool has been let down by politicians for decades. For too long, failed Labour and Conservative governments have destroyed Hartlepool’s jobs, gutted out public services, and undermined the ability of the police to maintain law and order.\n“Labour have held Hartlepool for 57 years and take the town for granted. They’ve failed to do anything about the loss of jobs and industry in Hartlepool, and instead have spent time pandering to radicals who hate Britain’s institutions and history. As a final insult, Labour has sneered at Hartlepool through parachuting in a failed MP who wants re-join the EU despite Hartlepool voting 70 per cent to leave – he literally wanted to undo the will of the people.\n“And despite their rhetoric, Conservative governments were the ones to strip Hartlepool of vital public services like Hartlepool Hospital’s A&E. The Tories have also undermined law and order by letting police numbers fall to rock-bottom levels, resulting in a town where many feel scared to walk the streets amid rampant antisocial behaviour.\n“If elected as an SDP MP, I’ll serve only the people of this town – not the party machines. I’ll work night and day to make sure the government delivers the investment and services that this town needs to prosper.”\nWilliam Clouston, Leader of the SDP, says:\n“For too long, both main parties have consistently ignored the needs of communities like Hartlepool. Neither party brings with it a real ambition to create jobs, fund public services, and ensure that the streets are kept safe. The two-party system has failed Hartlepool, just as it is failing the rest of the country.\n“This is not a time for politics as usual.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_school-daze/content_342.html": "As more teachers’ strikes loom, is it time to ask whether our school system is broken at a more fundamental level? The National Education Union, which of course has an axe to grind, has highlighted a rise in the number of teachers intending to leave the profession. Figures also suggest that many newly qualified teachers are deciding not not move forward in education, opting instead for less stressful jobs. Classroom management is also an issue with teachers having to spend too long dealing with uninterested and so often unruly pupils.\nTeachers are passionate and they want to support the younger generations in maximise their potential. But what if the school system can be changed to support teachers in this endeavour? To better enable this I argue that we need to consider what we have from a pupil perspective and to better understand where this potential lies in each pupil.\nAre our brightest academic pupils being given the opportunity in the classroom to fully engage in developing their knowledge? It would certainly seem not. But, likewise, are our more kinaesthetic pupils, who are much more practical in nature, being engaged to suit their ways of learning either? Answer as above.\nThe fact is we are setting our children up to fail by forcing them all down the same, singular educational pathway.\nIronically, one area of teaching practice is differentiation. This is where, as a teacher, you ensure your lessons cater for all skills levels in your classroom – you don’t run a task/activity exactly the same for everyone and you have different assessment criteria for those different pupil skills levels. And yet a broader differentiation between pupil talents – in type rather than in level – is overlooked.\nCould secondary schools be developed to offer two alternative pathways, each with its own specific benefits? Could we find a way of not squeezing square pegs into round holes?\nHere’s one proposal, in part with a mind towards Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, for those who want to do some further reading: after primary/middle school all pupils are allotted, through clear evidence-based assessment, to either an academically-focused school or a vocational one. One proviso to this is that after the first six months to one year each pupil is re-assessed to ensure they are in the right pathway.\nAcademic schools focus on pupils who have a propensity towards more traditional subjects – the sciences and humanities, IT, maths etc. This would enable the teachers to truly focus all their attention and levels of support to really drive pupil knowledge and skills, freeing up time and leading to far more enjoyable lessons for pupils and teachers alike. This focus could only benefit future arts, scientific and technological developments for this country.\nMeanwhile vocational schools would focus on all those pupils who are not fully engaged in their learning by sitting all day in a classroom but who would hugely benefit from much more active learning. Consider all the practical applications maths and English encompass. Plumbers look at diameters, water pressures. Hairdressers regularly consider ratios. Sports inevitably considers human biology, and so on. Lessons will be much more practical in nature but will embed all the same key knowledge and skills.\nFrom this we can also get a head start on shaping a workforce towards all the essential roles that keep a country moving. It would also lead to clearer referral links after secondary school towards apprenticeships and vocational qualifications. Over the longer run it could, I would hope, also lead a recalibration of attitudes so we don’t so readily privilege academic learning over more practical learning, as we – unlike many other countries – currently do to our detriment.\nSDP leader William Clouston has already noted how “we’ve gone down the route of massive over-expansion of university education, of over-credentialised professions and of easy labour supply disincentivizing training and apprenticeships. We need a rebalancing whereby not having a [traditional academic] degree doesn’t work against you.”\nIndeed, this dual pathway proposal would be a crucial part in changing attitudes, in shifting what has become an increasingly pervasive kind of snobbery towards those who have taken the vocational path. I am certainly not suggesting this would be quick or easy. It’s not just about pupils and teachers. Employers have to be encouraged to respect the legitimacy of vocational qualifications. Involving industry more in the content of post-secondary school vocational qualifications – helping to ensure they are up to date, when now they so often are not – may be one way of driving this.\nBut back to secondary school and its dual pathways first… The cost issues of this change cannot be ignored, of course, but I’d argue that the additional funding required would more than pay back in the dual pathway’s positive impact on the workforce, and by turns on society at large.\nI have one further proposal to better implement this dual pathway, one which might sound more radical than I believe it is. I would propose that no exams will be completed in favour of full teacher assessment of their pupils. It is not right that we favour those – often the more academically-inclined – who are able to cram knowledge. The exam system gives them an unfair advantage.\nTeachers know their pupils, see their development, effort and engagement is class. They see the quality of class work and homework completed. Termly grades will be completed to track development and highlight any areas of concern with final grades being allotted by the teachers themselves. This would immediately stop teachers, through no fault of their own, being pressured to teach a curriculum to ensure maximum pass rates to satisfy Ofsted.\nThis would also free teachers to take a broader approach to their subject – which most would love to be able to do – and not just teach the subject with a view to passing an exam. This approach would need detailed thinking before enacting – to ensure consistency and fairness in teacher assessments – but I believe it would be possible.\nWe can really engage our younger generations by supporting educational pathways that better target their individualised needs – and while the academic/vocational divide is not clear cut, and would not cater to all pupils (some of whom may be as happy in either camp, or neither), it is I believe a crucial step in the right direction.\nWe would have a younger generation that was more focused and career-orientated, rather just churned through the standardised system and spat out at the end. More importantly perhaps than preparing children for the working life, we could create a system in which they better enjoy learning for its own sake.\nToby is a quality improvement manager for Norfolk Adult Learning. Previously he was a teacher with YMCA Training. He is currently doing a Leadership and Management apprenticeship.\nContact the SDP if you have a policy proposal for consideration.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_fightback_wednesday-night-fightback-9-fighting-back-for-manchester/content_538.html": "In our ninth Wednesday Night Fightback, Michael Taylor and William Clouston respond to the recent Manchester Utd and Manchester City ‘slavery’ badge row, which was started by this Guardian article.\nMichael calls this an abominable slur on Manchester, whose working-class people played an important role in calling for abolition, even though they knew they had a lot to lose.\nWilliam and Michael discuss why workers in northern industrial towns empathised so readily with enslaved people, and ask whether there is a case to be made for slavery reparations.\nLink to Michael’s substack on Britain’s West Indian empire and the industrial revolution: https://michael665.substack.com/",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-end-of-indifference/content_532.html": "The lockdown will gradually recede, the empty pavements will refill and the task of rebuilding will begin. National crises, while painful, often herald a cultural shift. And so it could be here.\nFor years our leaders have been indifferent to things that matter. Now these things are impossible to ignore.\nLike naked bathers exposed when the tide ebbs, the Covid-19 crisis has brutally unmasked a series of liberal ideas whose time has passed. As the British Government scours the globe for medical kit we might ponder the West’s hollowed-out industrial base – unable to produce the goods in an hour of need.\nIndifference is the word which describes much of what we’ve been fed. Its effects – like viral droplets spreading through the air – are everywhere.\nIndustrially, we got here by our leaders listening to hyper-globalists who told us it doesn’t matter where anything is made. These people mocked anyone who cared about national resilience or indeed about national anything. But it takes a particular kind of progressive to completely detach vile, totalitarian regimes from the cheap products we buy from them. We shouldn’t.\nLikewise, the inequality caused by our form of capitalism is said to be tolerated ‘because it works’, but that’s only convincing if it actually… works. A system which feeds off unsustainable household debt – eventually causing the beggary of its people – is clearly failing.\nThis passive indifference has spread far and wide. Our leaders don’t care who runs our railways (German, French and Dutch state railways…) or where the trains and rolling stock are made. ‘It doesn’t matter’ they’ll say, although families in Crewe and Birmingham now working the ‘gig economy’ might disagree.\nNeither, apparently, do we need to train our own doctors and nurses because we can import these economic units (a.k.a. people) – an approach which betrays a callousness to impoverished nations losing their very best.\nNor, with a continent full of energetic and diligent workers, do we need to bother with vocational training for our young. The fact that Marek and Svetlana are so often a credit to their employers doesn’t help untrained kids sitting at home in Ashington.\nSocially, the pattern is the same. Tolerance is the word progressives use to mask their indifference but it’s a type of indifference all the same. It’s dishonest to disconnect widespread crime, unhappiness and other social ills from their root cause in family breakdown. To hear this never mentioned on the BBC tells a lot about the decline of that once-great national institution.\nIn this liberal world of ours, we’re invited to step over people begging in the street while passively inhaling wafts of skunk in our town centres without noticing something important… that it didn’t used to be like this. Must we be indifferent to this?\nIt’s not British people but, rather, their cultural masters who don’t care. They mistake their indifference for ours.\nSo, what next? While the evidently liberal Tories will no doubt tilt just as much as opinion polls tell them is necessary, the identity-obsessed and race-baiting Labour Party has nothing to offer. An NHS applauded and a lockdown honoured without complaint proves that people deeply value national solidarity and, as 2016 referendum showed, are prepared to work for it.\nLiberal indifference appears to be on the wane. But it needs a push. Perhaps it can be helped on its way by a political party which almost died young, recovered and is blooming once again: the revived SDP?\nPeople want a future which is softer and more communitarian; more secure but less individualistic; more domestic and less globalist; fairer and less unequal.\nFortunately, there’s a blueprint for that called the ‘Social Market’. It’s where the public and private sectors are not opponents, where free markets are regulated in the national interest and where taxes owed are collected to build a better society.\nreinstate the Bradbury Pound end the FIAT Money printing system good news the virus is in decline now\nIf you say that the root cause of all sorts of social ills is family breakdown, surely you then have to defend the term ‘broken family’ and the stigma and pity that went with it. You have to promote an understanding of ‘family’ that many will think reactionary and tyrannical. You will have to deny that families can come in an indefinite number of shapes and sizes. You will have not only to — let us say — revisit the meaningfulness (and legality) of ‘homosexual marriage’ but perhaps even raise the question of whether or not some ‘communities’ suffer more from the breaking of families and the absence of fathers than others. You cannot do any of this without being vilified.\nComing from a family full of nurses I suppose I am a bit biased when I say that it would be great if the SDP could support the people who are thinking about going into the nursing profession.\nI think the degree system we currently have is outdated and puts many of the students off. My fiancee has said that it was the worst degree she has ever completed. I saw how much she disliked it, even though she and many of her friends (on the nursing course) loved the actual work experience of working in the hospital environment.\nThis is why I think it would be best if the nursing degrees were restructured into an apprenticeship scheme where the apprenticeship nurses would be paid on full salary as this would be an incentive for students and poorer people from poorer backgrounds who may be thinking about nursing as a particular long term career. Remember when nurses were originally trained as they worked on the hospital floor? Maybe that wasn’t such a bad idea?\nI also think the SDP should financially help medicine students if our nation is in desperate need for more doctors. I completely agree that importing doctors from other nation states is not an advantage for those (usually poorer) nation states and is neither a good long term strategy for Britain either. Something needs to be done on policy if we are to increase the numbers.\nThe problem Chris Davie with putting student nurses on full salary, is they then become part of the work force. True student status means those in training remain supernumerary, protecting them from being left in dangerous situations due to staff shortage and allowing time to study.\nIt’s a debate that has been ongoing in the nursing profession for decades. I agree there should be far more work experience and better financial suppory, but don’t agree an apprenticeship scheme is the way. We’ve been there, done that and frankly it led to a lot of dangerous situations for both patients and nurses.\nHi. Could I just ask what you would say were the differences between the SDP and Blue Labour, – politically,socially and economically. Thank you.\nDear Mark,\nI think there are far more similarities than differences between the SDP and BL. When I’m asked I struggle to find substantial differences but I suppose there are a few. First, BL now says it is not ‘communitarian’ and yet the SDP is emphatically so. Secondly, I think the SDP is perhaps a little more paternalistic in its thinking than BL. Thirdly, we are strong supporters of the Social Market economic model but I think BL – or Maurice Glasman at least – is much more idealistic about industrial democracy than we are.\nI don’t think these differences should be over emphasised. We regard BL as political kin. They are merely using a different vehicle to achieve similar aims.\nWhy can’t an apprenticeship system work? It does in Engineering where if people do things wrong, then houses or factories would burn down through electrical faults or similar things? and guess what, they hardly ever do whereas the level of medical malpractice in the NHS is at an all time high in the current system??\nMedical staff would start off with basic training and they would be porters, they would be cleaners and they would wipe peoples arses.\nSome would stay doing that and there’s no shame for those that do.\nSome would want to take their training further and get more qualified and that would be great and when they were more qualified they would still appreciate the porters, cleaners and arse wipers because they would have been there and they would know how difficult those jobs are.\nStart them off on £10 an hour and there would be no problem filling the roles. It might take 5 years to see results but better than the appalling University driven system that we have today.\nA good and interesting article. I find it a strange experience to agree with every word!\nI suspect that many people in Britain (and elsewhere for that matter) would agree with these ideas, but it is going to be very difficult for your party to get a hearing. I would like to think that important parts of the media would give you a hearing, but who? Your message is too left-wing for the right-wing media and too patriotic and pro-working class for the snobby anti-British ‘progressives’.\nGood luck!\nAt last !!!!! A party that gives me a home. How we achieve all this is another matter though …..\nhttps://www.newchartistmovent.org.uk\nGood common sense views. We need to get back to making things\nThe most disadvantaged group in society are the white working class who have paid the costs of globalism and mass immigration. Labour have completely let them down. When I was in UKIP I advocated that this was a section of society that was totally unrepresented. Thanks to Farage and his neo liberal views we missed this opportunity to represent them. Theresa May started to take the Tories in this direction under the direction of Nick Timothy. Johnson has jumped into the void to hoover up the patriotic left behind working class. Those who have lent the Tories their support will soon realise that they have been sold a “pup”",

Others are more insidious, such as the ‘nudge’ tactics and fear propaganda deployed by the Behavioural Insights Team during the Covid pandemic.\nIn their bestselling book Free Your Mind, Laura and her co-author Patrick Fagan discuss how to spot and resist the increasing manipulation present in our everyday lives.\nWhy are some attempts at political or social manipulation more successful than others? Can such tactics ever be justified? And what are the implications for freedom of thought and for democracy?\nLaura is also a guest speaker at the SDP Conference in October 2023.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2021_09_14_sdp-opposes-moves-to-vaccinate-children/content_689.html": "14th September, 2021 – The Social Democratic Party (SDP) today announces its opposition to the government’s plans to proceed with a vaccination programme for healthy children aged 12 to 15.\nEarlier this month the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) concluded that while the health benefits from vaccination among children aged 12 to 15 are marginally greater than potential known harms, the margin of benefit is too small to support such a move. Despite this, the government and the Chief Medical Officer have chosen to set aside the JCVI’s advice.\nThe justification for this decision – namely, to reduce educational disruption – is spurious. Given the UK’s successful adult vaccination roll-out there is now no reason to further disrupt the education of the young on any basis, given that young people’s risk profile is so low and all the adult population has had a chance to embrace vaccination. The marginal benefit of vaccination for children indicates that, evidently, this decision is not being taken in the interests of children.\nAdditionally, the prospect of children being vaccinated without parental consent is a serious violation of parental authority and undermines the relationship between the family and the state. It also places undue responsibility on the children concerned and, indeed, runs contrary to all precedents regarding respect for the authority of the family in domestic life.\nSDP Leader William Clouston says: “For the state to ask a 12 year old to deliberate – without parental consent – on a matter as important as personal vaccination is totally unacceptable. The latest ONS data shows that vaccinations have been highly effective among the adult population, rendering this move pointless. It’s time to live without the spectre of emergency measures and stop undermining our civil liberties – we need to take the win, open up society, and move on.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-death-of-the-patriotic-corporation/content_18.html": "When John Cadbury first went into business in 1824, he did so firmly rooted in one place, and that place was Birmingham. The societal benefits that he and his brother produced have outlived their confectionary creations, and indeed themselves.\nToday the Bournville housing estate, built by the Cadbury brothers to provide their workers with high quality, low-cost housing, remains one the best places to live in the UK. As John said at the time “If the country is a good place to live in, why not to work in?”, and he set about making sure it would be, by providing his employees with days off, pension plans, unemployment benefits and much more besides.\nTwo hundred years on, the Cadbury foundation remains committed to the Birmingham area and its people and are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Today, James Cadbury, who is John’s great-great-great-grandson, runs the Love Cocoa company, which manufactures in the UK, and plants a tree every time you buy a bar of their chocolate. Though the spirit of Cadbury lives on through the deeds of their progeny and Love Cocoa, the Cadbury company itself exists today in name only.\nIn 2009, the American conglomerate Kraft launched a hostile takeover of Cadbury, and immediately thereafter set about closing the British Keynsham plant and relocating production from Ireland and New Zealand to China and Mexico.\nIn 1862, the Yorkshiremen Henry Isaac Rowntree and his brother Joseph first became chocolatiers, just as the Cadbury’s had done before them. They founded the model village of New Earswick for their employees, replete with football and rugby pitches, a swimming pool, tennis courts and cricket grounds.\nBy 1896, Rowntree employees enjoyed an eight-hour workday, by 1906 a pension scheme, and in 1923 they were eligible for participation in a profit-sharing plan. John’s son, Seebohm, used his wealth to conduct the now-famous York Studies, which shaped and influenced David Lloyd George’s Liberal reforms.\nBut in 1988, after the takeover of Rowntree’s by Nestlé, thousands of jobs were cut, and factories closed. Despite their commitment to honour the city of York and the Rowntree heritage, Nestlé has steadily began offshoring and besmirching that legacy, taking jobs from York and sending them to Hamburg and beyond.\nCadburys and Rowntree were not islands peeking above the degradations of Victorian industrial life but were emblematic of the philanthropic spirit of the time.\nThey were joined in their efforts by William Hesketh Lever and his model village of Port Sunlight, which he built on the Wirral for his soap factory workers. In Bradford Sir Titus Salt built bathhouses, a hospital, a concert hall, a laboratory, and a school for his workers. Edward Akroyd built two villages to support his manufacturing enterprises and formed the Yorkshire penny bank to help his workers create savings and was so beloved that some 15,000 mourners attended his funeral.\nThese men were the elites of the industrial world, and much of their generosity was born out of naked self-interest, no doubt. In an era which predated globalisation, offshoring was cost-prohibitive. It was good business sense to make sure that the workers upon whom your profits depended were in good health, good houses and sufficiently well-educated enough to operate your machinery.\nThe social provisions of the state were in those times thin, and any forward-thinking entrepreneur knew that it would be incumbent upon themselves to fulfil their worker’s basic needs. A limited state, in a pre-globalised world, with an added dash of Christian morality, lent itself to ethical business.\nFar from being rooted in place, they are owned by shareholders who are often domiciled in Monaco, or the Cayman Islands, or Luxemburg.\nFormula 1 teams, headquartered in Britain, alongside other automotive and vehicular specialists like JCB, all have a stake in the land, factories on the ground, and workers on the front lines who moved with rapid pace to build respirators and ventilators. It was Burberry who made our PPE in the North East, while Nike and Adidas were nowhere to be seen.\nBut these often-heroic efforts are exceptions to the otherwise pervasive and exploitative behaviour of the modern corporate class. When schools were shut, and the Government were bungling the distribution of laptops to the disadvantaged, What could be said of Amazon’s efforts to chip into the national effort, against a disease which killed hundreds of thousands of their customers?\nThe corporations who predominate in this country are not great oaks entrenched in our earth, but tumbleweeds which pass with indifference, dumping their products blithely. Their interest is not in the good of the nation, or her people, rather their bottom lines. And in this globalised world, there are always new and emerging markets to fence products, and impoverished countries to take their jobs. The responsibility of the corporation is now foremost to its shareholders. The notion that Facebook could be patriotic, seems farcical.\nThe twenty-first century has seen profits privatised and losses socialised. Companies who are entirely dependent on state education, infrastructure, and health provisions, now scramble to dodge tax by any means necessary.\nLet’s give the corporate class the benefit of the doubt and put it down to human nature. Let’s assume that they will do whatever they can get away with. Should we now assume that gainful employment can simply no longer support a family, increase social mobility, or purchase a house?\nWhy should the taxpayer foot the bill by way of tax credits because of your poverty pay? Is it right that couples can ill afford to start a family on actual wages?\nUltimately the enablers of these parasitic behaviours have been successive governments the last fifty years. While Labour claims to be pro-worker, their ideological commitment to uncontrolled migration is exactly the kind of policy the oligarchs would love as a means to further drive down their already pitiful wage rates.\nThe Conservative Party is equally galivanting around the world doing trade deals that jeopardise the continued longevity and viability of the few truly British producers still standing.\nNeither of the main parties sees the wisdom in wedding-controlled migration with ethical production and regulation. And while they might occasionally offer up one of these things, this is not sufficient to put an end to the corporate degradation of our social realm.\nThere are still good companies, of course. Nissan, when it set up its Sunderland plant, employed local workers, as is the Japanese way. Those workers now operate one of the most efficient car plants in Europe, and Nissan have shown their thanks by doubling down on their commitment to Sunderland, vowing to build a new Gigafactory there, and in doing so, creating a further 1650 jobs.\nBut the predominant spirit is not that of Nissan or Burberry, rather the proclivity to use agency workers, zero-hour contracts, to outsource wherever possible, and import immigrant labour where not. That this is allowed to happen, and the consequences of it being allowed, fundamentally land at the feet of our toothless political class, who for one reason or another, are content to allow corporations to profiteer and run roughshod over the obligations that their privileged position demands.\nIt’s time corporations be reminded of their duties.

The peaceful coexistence of independent nation-states is a fundamental social democratic goal and respect for national frontiers is indispensable to this aim. Military invasions of this type are counterproductive, inhumane and raise the spectre of the horrors of Europe’s past.\nThis invasion is in the interests of neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian people.\nPost-Cold War policy pursued by both NATO and the European Union – including overtures to Ukraine to consider membership – have proved counterproductive and destabilising. Strategic stability is paramount and is best served by Ukrainian independence and neutrality.\nSDP Leader William Clouston says:\n“The Russian Federation should immediately desist from all military action and withdraw its forces from Ukraine. We should know from recent experience that military adventures and invasions have proved disastrous.\nWhilst deploring Russia’s actions I don’t believe any case can be made for direct military intervention by Britain’s armed forces. Immediate priority should be given to strengthening NATO and, in particular, supporting our allies such as Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states. However, there must also be a realisation that too many NATO members act as ‘free riders’ and fail to honour the pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence. Going forward, this commitment should be a condition of NATO membership.\nEconomic and diplomatic sanctions should be considered but we need to bear in mind that Russia has made itself largely immune to such action – as the post-2014 EU sanctions have demonstrated. Russia has low debt and huge foreign currency reserves, and has ultimately made itself into a semi-autarky. At the same time, retaliative sanctions by Russia involving gas supply would economically cripple Europe. Western policymakers must work with this reality.”",

This has left millions of people feeling powerless, politically homeless, and stigmatised as being morally inferior. People are crying out for change and better representation, but there are promising signs that this dominance is starting to be challenged.\nLink to Matt Goodwin’s substack: https://mattgoodwin.substack.com/\nThe current Ruling class here in the UK and most of the Western World know they are on borrowed time Sturgeon Arden and Macron in particular have are in the process of being brought down how long will it be before Sunak and Starmer go the same way",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_2019-general-election-a-campaign-tale-from-tooting/content_244.html": "Every so often life throws you an opportunity that is just too good to turn down. Mine occurred one dark and stormy October night after a couple of glasses of Merlot in a backroom at El Vino’s in London’s Blackfriars.\nAt an SDP London meeting, branch chair Patrick O’Flynn was outlining how he thought a General Election was imminent. Patrick said he felt it was the right time for the SDP to make a soft launch in London and was looking for two volunteers willing to stand as SDP candidates.\nWhy did I put my hand up? Well, there were three reasons:\nFirstly, I was disappointed with the way Brexit had been mishandled by David Cameron and Theresa May.\nSecondly, an indecisive Brexit position, rife anti-Semitism and Jeremy Corbyn made me fear a Labour win.\nFinally it quite simply felt like the opportunity of a lifetime to be involved in a process I was brought up to believe is the single most patriotic act a citizen can do for their country.\nThat being the case, my sense of panic kicked in about two minutes after my hand went up and my anxiety continued to rise and fall till about 4.30 a.m. on 13th December when the final count was given! Truth be told, I had no idea what I had let myself in for.\nI stood for the constituency where I live, which is Tooting in south west London which has a voting population of 77,500. In the 2017 election, Labour achieved a majority of 13,500 and it’s in a borough where 75 per cent voted to Remain.\nAs a small pro-Brexit party we knew that it wasn’t just a hill we had to climb, but a whole mountain range!\nOur biggest task would be explaining to under-40s who we are and to the over-40s where we’d been since 1992, which was the last time the SDP fought a seat in London. Our assumption proved to be correct because throughout the campaign the most common doorstep response to our introduction was “I didn’t realise the SDP was still going”.\nWe had limited funds and few London supporters. Our only resources were copies of the A-Z, 10,000 leaflets, stunning rosettes, comfortable shoes, a sense of humour and loads of optimism!\nWhere I was extremely lucky was to have two totally committed members who knew their way around a campaign. They were life-savers. We dubbed ourselves The Three Leafleteers and thus began our charm offensive.\nFor six weeks we pounded the streets, deftly wielding our spatulas — a leafleting technique designed to get past the more difficult letterboxes and snarling dogs. We spoke to anyone and everyone who opened their door, listened to grievances, agreed with those who “just wanted to get Brexit done”, admired front gardens, attended a Jewish Hanukkah party and even sang with a Christian revival group outside St. Georges Hospital!\nI’m the first to hold up my hand and say I’m not a natural public speaker and I found the one hustings I attended terrifying. My brain turned to mush and my hands were shaking so badly that I had to turn to one of my opponents — a charming candidate from the Green Party — to help me turn over the pages of my speech. It will stay with me as one the most nerve-wracking three hours of my life. But much to my amazement people came up to me at the end to say how good it was to hear somebody who “sounded normal”.\nWe knew the odds were stacked heavily against us. Our opponents seemed to have a bottomless supply of money and activists when it came to producing and distributing publicity material. Labour delivered a different leaflet daily not to mention a ‘newspaper’, extensive advertising hoardings and videos — which appeared to be a bit of overkill given they already held the seat with a substantial majority.\nDid we achieve our objective? Some might say that a return of only 71 votes does not look promising but we’ve taken the first vital steps in re-building the SDP in London.\nI loved my experience and would heartily recommend it to anyone who is thinking of standing.\nI somewhat echo your comments being a first time candidate too. I found one of the hardest issues I had to deal with was time, or more accurately the lack of time. I didn’t think it was appropriate to be knocking on people’s doors after dark and working full time really meant campaigning at the weekend. I too had some fantastic help with running stalls and leafleting. I was extremely fortunate to have Paula and Kirsty delivering leaflets during the week and helping out on the stalls at the weekends for which I am extremely grateful. I was also fortunate to have William on my campaign stalls and leafleting a couple of times, despite running his own campaign in Leeds, Ian and Andy also come out to give assistance.\nOne of the more curious things was when William took my voice around the constituency in the tannoy car. I had many people poke fun at that until I pointed out that it worked as they had remembered it. Whether they voted for me or not was irrelevant the fact was it got both my name and the party name out there.\nI did get one media endorsement which meant a lot to me and that was from Rod Liddle I the sun newspaper, thanks Rod.\nI would never have stood in a general election as my first election if I had the choice, but the timing was not of our choosing and we had to capitalise on it.\nAt the outset the result was unimportant to me as the task was to raise the party profile. I know that this was successful and to be part of the team around the country that did that was\namazing.\nFrom my position the general election allowed us to be familiarised with the process of election and get our names recognisable for future elections. I hope to take full advantage of this great work in the local elections in 2021 and hope our other general election candidates will consider standing locally too.\nGood luck to all our future candidates.\nOne word springs to mind….courage.\nI’m proud to say also stood in the election, and I heartily endorse Roz’s encouragement of people to stand. My experiences were in some ways similar to hers, although mine was a single-handed effort in a geographically huge constituency, so I had to ration and target my door-time carefully.\nI have a couple of observations. First, it took me some time to muster up the courage to go from leafleting to door knocking. But I found the intense listening and meeting process moving and rewarding in itself. I thought I knew my home town – I know it better now. The welcome I (usually) got told its own story of how taken-for-granted most people are in ‘safe’ constituencies like mine. It left me feeling grateful and beholden to the 127 voters who supported me. I don’t want them let down by me or by the SDP.\nThe second observation is more disturbing: I did four hustings and altogether I was shaken by the level of candidates’ disinterest about verifiable facts, and the willingness to – how shall I put this – ignore inconvenient facts. Maybe ‘safe seats’ throw up sub-standard electoral candidates?\nAnd the third observation: the old established parties may be fairly useless, but they have distinct advantages not only in name recognition, organization and finance, but also because they know their way around the electoral system. They know what they are doing. In the general election, novices like Roz and I had to waste time ‘learning’. We’ll not have that excuse next time.\nWhy do Working class People still bother with the Labour Party I have found even more snobby and rude than the Tories the SDP could be the real opposition to the Tories ending the duopoly of the LibLabConSNP regime is long overdue https://www.getborisout.com\nDear Roz,\nYour courage in fighting Tottenham was simply awe-inspiring. Bearing in mind the vertical cliff of an up-hill struggle you had on your hands – (few helpers, no publicity, little money, etc) you did very well.\nCongratulations on giving us all such a positive example.\ndoes the SDP have a office in Havering where I live I would like to stand as a candidate for You at the next election\nIn 2009 I joined UKIP. We fielded a candidate in my constituency of the Forest of Dean in the 2010 General Election. On my own, I leafleted about 5000 households. The people who I spoke with had no idea who UKIP were or what they stood for. We did a couple of public meetings and had some street stalls. Amazingly, we polled over 2500 votes and saved our deposit. Over the next few years, we built up the branch and started to stand in local elections. Eventually in 2012 we had a candidate elected to a town council. The following year , myself and two colleagues were elected as county councillors. In 2015, we fielded 30 candidates in district elections with 7 people elected. in the General Election, UKIP polled over 6500 votes.\nThis demonstrates that a small party can grow if it appeals to the public.\nI am not pretending that it is easy and being a single issue party can assist in some circumstances but it can be done\nHonestly I didn’t know the SDP still existed until yesterday – thought it had been wound up when the Lib Dems were created.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2025_04_30_a-union-of-shared-values/content_551.html": "IS IT TIME FOR THE OLD COLONIAL-ERA IDEA OF CANZAK TO BE RE-APPRAISED? RICHARD SMITH ARGUES THAT IT’S NEVER BEEN MORE TIMELY.\n‘The 51st state’ has been a controversial term in the news over recent months that, for many, Trump supporters nowithstanding, has caused concern. However, others have seen it as a rallying cry to shore up a fledgling movement comprising Canada, Australia, New Zealand and UK (CANZUK). Something once retired as a jingoistic idea – belonging to bygone empire days – is now something many are revisiting as a legitimate concept – something that I believe the SDP would benefit by backing, and that we would all benefit from by supporting on a personal level.\nThe idea of CANZUK has been around in some variety since its first mention by William David McIntyre in the 1960s – and, while it has since tended to be seen as a colonial hangover, this is to belie its potential as a concept around which a shared legal, language, culture and history could coalesce to benefit not only the world, but the countries within that union. This is an aspect that ties in with the SDP’s foreign affairs policy, joining into a strong strategic defence pact that would promote and defend parliamentary democracy and individual liberty throughout the world, the shared democratic and legal systems of the four nations acting as a goal to which others might aspire.\nThe strategic defence aspect is a key part due to the rise of new global powers and the inconsistency of previously steadfast allies. In both world wars, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined within days of the UK declaring war and fought with us to defend freedom from start to end, at great personal loss to their own countries.\nThis is something we should be considering now when looking at the current situation and the rhetoric around Canada being the ‘51st State’ as well as the current economic hardships being imposed upon the nations by recent excessive tariffs from other allies. CANZUK would foster a defence agreement, which could be built on an existing framework the likes of Five Eyes. It would also enable all the countries to have an equal footing, and it would build upon the already present ability for personnel to transfer between each country’s military.\nAnother benefit to a CANZUK union is the creation of a free trade economic zone, backed by free movement amongst the nations. With over-lapping culture, environmental goals and labour rights, the economic benefit of having a mobile and free workforce will be immeasurable, and whilst this does go against the SDP’s immigration policy being skills and needs based, I believe a CANZUK free movement would provide a net positive gain, bringing fresh-but-shared skills to meet the needs of the UK and vice versa.\nWith COVID-19 only a few years ago showing us how fragile global supply chains can be, having a shared economic agreement with countries that also share our values would protect us from any hostile dependency. With this in mind a free flowing CANZUK corridor of trade and talent looks like a sensible insurance policy.\nCANZAK would be, finally, an expression of soft power – which is the real power in geopolitics today. A shared media, education, sport and humour not only acts as a diplomatic cheat code by making conversation more natural, having no need for translation or accidental cultural mishaps, but it is also a massive benefit to carrying public opinion. This would not be a political agreement – it would be more like holding a family dinner. The projection and influence this would create would act as a bastion to promote social liberty worldwide.\nYou may believe I am advocating for us to put ‘all our eggs in one basket.’ I am not. Instead, I aim for us to support a CANZUK ideal that runs parallel to NATO and the EU, as a safeguard against the breakdown of older alliances and a strong step towards building a mutually-beneficial future.\nThe world is rapidly changing. Old reliable friends and alliances are under strain and new threats, from climate change to economic warfare, require a new kind of cooperation. CANZUK is not just an expression of some ‘pat on the back, cling to the past’ ethos, but a solid step forward. The SDP policy of fostering a defence pact is a step in the right direction. However, with the world becoming more unpredictable, it is the time for Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK to stand together.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_black-lives-matter-how-should-we-respond/content_138.html": "Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a masterpiece of political marketing.\nIt’s a slogan with a campaign attached, linked to some pretty heavy racial ideology and propaganda. None of it can be criticised without appearing to oppose the idea that black lives do indeed matter.\nBLM is a classic and effective piece of rhetorical blackmail. Either get on board or you’re a racist: that is the logic of it – a logic driven by fear.\nIt’s the perfect slogan, as befitting the powerful alignment between progressive liberal-left politics and the PR, media and advertising industries across the Anglophone world. There’s an immediate and powerful social block on even questioning this movement just from its name.\nOne of the great successes of the campaign is how it has got many institutions in our society applying this block themselves, promoting the organisation and even punishing insiders who publicly question and criticise any activities carried out under the BLM branding. Manx Radio suspended presenter Stu Peters for responding to the movement with the phrase ‘all lives matter’ and questioning the idea of ‘white privilege’ live on air. Literature Wales removed Western Mail journalist Martin Shipton from the Wales Book of the Year judging panel for comments criticising BLM on social distancing. In the mainstream broadcast media, the group has barely been challenged.\nIt appears that institutional Britain has broadly accepted that political support for Black Lives Matter is compulsory, seemingly without questioning it or being able to critically assess its goals.\nThere’s a sort of totalitarianism about this but not a totalitarianism of the state. Rather, we see a largely voluntary gathering of non-state and state actors to push its slogans and talking points using their public relations functions and broadcasting ability. This reflects a longstanding ritual in our society of ‘giving-way’ to progressive identity activists who present themselves and the groups they claim to represent as victims in need of special protection or favour.\nIt’s likely that very few people in institutional Britain have a clue what they are supporting when they back BLM, as the England football teams did before the weekend’s protests and as Yorkshire Tea has done since, despite the rioting and attacks on police.\nHowever, as David Goodhart tweeted, if you check out the Black Lives Matter UK GoFundMe page (which has raised a remarkable £775,000 in just seven days at the time of writing), what you find is disingenuous “far left nonsense”.\nThe BLM manifesto, seemingly copied and pasted from previous far left campaigns, tells us,\n“We’re guided by a commitment to dismantle imperialism, capitalism, white-supremacy, patriarchy and the state structures that disproportionately harm black people in Britain and around the world.”\nIt says it will spend the funds on political lobbying, “Developing and delivering healing practices in black communities”, whatever that means, and “Developing and delivering training, police monitoring and strategies for the abolition of police.” It also talks about wanting “reparations of black people dealing with generational trauma and institutional racism”.\nIt’s drivel, but dangerous drivel: trying to stir up grievance among their target groups and shame governments, business and individuals into giving them and other activists money: a kind of political protection racket.\nI think our major institutions – and indeed many of us as individuals, let’s be honest – give way to this sort of stuff because we are weak and what we really stand for is not easily condensed into a simple slogan.\nSupporting progressive identity activism gives us a quick ‘hit’ of that meaning and purpose we lack, making us appear in a positive light to those who dominate our public life and those who go along with this domination. The identity activists exploit this for all its worth.\nSuperficially this ‘virtue signalling’ makes life easier, while thinking for ourselves and going against the grain makes things harder.\nHowever, going along with it doesn’t ultimately protect us. The demands keep on coming. For BLM is a campaign with no possible limits and no end in sight. They always want more and always have accusations of racism in their back pocket to use if you choose to resist.\nRepeatedly giving way to activists has led to their domination of our major institutions, in which many now hold gatekeeper positions and are increasingly moving into top jobs where they can direct money and power to their own groups and away from others.\nThis is the way it’s going. We can see it in America with the New York Times and other media outlets. We can also see it in our own BBC, many of whose presenters now openly propagate radical identity politics, seemingly not bothered by the damage they are doing to one of our country’s greatest creations and its reputation for impartiality. The BBC routinely gives BLM activists a platform to voice nebulous claims – claims which the corporation apparently lacks the inclination or the will to scrutise. Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish activists from BBC presenters.\nAs they demand more and more favouritism (normally via the apparently harmless idea of ‘representation’), those taking on an activist role do immense damage to race relations. It may work for them personally in the short term, but it is a disaster for the cause they claim to be advocating for.\nAfter all, racial favouritism in the form of conventional white-on-black racism is what this movement is meant to be opposing.\nFavouritism is ultimately toxic for trust in organisations and society as a whole. By promoting more and more of it, to the extent that they and their causes appear untouchable, BLM activists, their celebrity fans and the weak and naive institutions that indulge them are creating the conditions for resentment to thrive.\nSocial Democrats must resist this and patiently explain to people what is going on whenever we get the chance – and encourage people to think for themselves rather than be browbeaten by activists.\nPerhaps the saddest irony of BLM is that its programme, if implemented, would unite black and all other lives in the harm done to them.\nWe’re up against it – but that’s all the more reason to try.\nSlavery is rife in Africa, Black people are victims of terrorism and war in Africa, Gay people are thrown off tall buildings in the Middle East. Uigers are imprisioned in camps in China. Why are thes atrocities not mentioned by BLM? Because it does not fit into the Marxist identity politics agenda of destroying the culture of the West.\nGay people are thrown of tall buildings exactly where??? I live in Middle east country we had pride walk, people and police just watched them and let them do their thing… There was never any incident about gay people in my country, nothing like you said! Stop using area name like middle east and give a exact country city name. Your mindless generalizing hurts all middle easterns not only bad apples!\nI agree, I find the comments he has put are wrong and very biased/incorrect\nIraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia are places I’ve found that it’s been reported.\nSo you are spokesperson for the whole of your Country; as it is in the scriptures to punish gays; how many people in your Country would condone such attrocities of throwing off gays at the highest point? After all, from your comment, ‘to let them do their own thing’ suggests, you may tolerent them but not accept them into your society\nLister and natalie\nYour an example of warped identity politics .. being gay in the Middle East or in most Muslim countries is very problematic and dangerous … sex between men in 16 of the 22 countries is illegal and in 6 punishable by death … slavery in Africa is rife with trafficking of children and women and sexual slavery prevalent …instead of targeting actual slavery and gay rights you target the truth speaker who don’t agree with your narratives .., your part of the problem not the solution … those Black Lives Matter .. but not to the black lies matter activists ( mostly white liberals )\nHow dare you! The facts are right there, I’ve seen this happen, I’ve travelled to these countries, just because your sat in your bedroom on laptop or mobile phone and dismissive of truthful facts makes you a very Ignorant individual of the plight and suffering of Gay people in Saudi Arabian states. You obviously have never left your bedroom or set foot in these places.\nWho cares about a 3rd world craphole thinks anyway\nOk. But what do we do?\nThe headline promised some ideas!\nDo not be weak. Stand up to protect what you believe. Hold your values and principles like a shield and sword and stand fast.\nBLM has shown, the only way to get your voice heard is to get out on the streets. Show you oppose BLM far left revolutionary racist doctrine, and educate others. The mainstream media will only give a myopic one sided woke view so people need to be made aware of the full picture\nThe level of control the left wing has in our days is really worrying, sad people dont learn from the past. We have to just be patient, they target the young to, who are less likely to question things like this\nUnfortunately, taking to the streets would have a detrimental effect. The main stream media would show “racist” mob marches, not peaceful protest movement. Better to remain a silent majority.\nI’m pretty sure we all agree in equality and tolerance, but remember, tolerance means ‘putting up with’ and equality doesn’t mean special.\n@Alan Major: Even better: Instead of holding your values and principles like a sword, do it the other way round. Hold a piece of sharpened steel to defend your values and principles. Because this is what it will come down to in the next years.\nWhere BLM (and related organizations) doesn’t have success with intimidation and through “soft” terror, e.g. political, medial and social diffamation of opponents, they resort to violence. Be prepared to fight back – mentally, morally, politically and most importantly – physically. The “moral high ground” does not help you if your enemy are nazis, stalinists and/or BLM.\nDown with things like that!\nAlso hold a real shield and a real sword, for just in case.\nRecently in Canada, a BLM activist has publicly garnered applause for saying that white people are genetically deficiant and sub-human, and that white people therefore must be killed. That might ring a bell, at least with some of the older folks.\nStill trying to figure out who Black Lives Matter too\nRubbish u have more opportunities then ever black lives matter need to be arrested and put in prison there nothing but vile people\nTwo ideas:\n1. Donate as much as you can to any organisations that uphold British values. Your local history groups, alternative media, free thought and speech groups. These are the people who will end up opposing a lot of what BLM want to destroy in this country.\n2. Keep an eye on what your local council is doing (especially if it is Labour) and object to anything that you feel is being done to appease the BLM hysteria.\nGonna take serious actions with consequences. A laser in my eye might get something back at you\nActions have consequences. If we don’t stop this stupid shit we gonna be shooting each other. Blm is bullshit They never help a black person except their self get richer.\nBlacks don’t support this crap.\nQuite agree you\nAll we have left is electoral heft. The majority of quiet, tolerant British people hate this stuff. So we must use that democratic will while we have it – pressing the government to recapture our public institutions. Any body receiving public money or guarantees must commit to observe and promote political impartiality within its field – universities, schools, public broadcasters, and all public services. This is a policy that is practicable, but it would require immense leadership.\nI agree, the problem is, we’re currently at a time when our government, institutions and polite society is utterly in the thrall of BLM. Failure to show support can get you in trouble. I mean literally staying out of it can be considered an offence. Actual criticism can get you sacked, ostracised or physically attacked.\nIn such a climate, how on earth do we apply that pressure. We’re in an entirely captured society. They are a minority but they’re the establishment. How on earth do we apply pressure to a captured establishment, not to be captured when criticism is currently considered a punishable offence in work places, council offices, boardrooms and middle class dinner parties. Not to mention a punchable, kickable, stabable offence on many a London street.\nThis isn’t an ordinary situation.\nBlm why arnt they protesting for the children and people of Africa that go hungry and without water. Why dont they ever help them\nWell they do but Africa can’t help it;s self! A lot of Elite in Africa taught by the West!\nThats its blame someone else for Africas elite not taking personal responsibility for their own actions.\nLike where in the west are children left to starve?\n@david painton – Yr comment “A lot of Elite in Africa taught by the West!” is nonsense. Heard of Emperor Haile Selassie? Rich, elite dictator? Sorry you got it wrong and it’s clear you are rather marxist in that comment – it is human nature so stop with the blame game.\nI work for a public sector organisation. They have published an Anti Racism Toolkit. The document defines racism, then later goes on to define White Privilege, in such a way, that matches their own definition of racism!! How can you argue with people who don’t use logic?\nLater, they talk about the BLM movement, explaining that it came about after the deaths of black people at the hands of the police in several American States. Well, thanks for that. How does that relate to a British public sector department?\nDuring the 1980s, I spent a lot of my time shitting my pants, thinking that communists were going to drop a nuclear bomb on us. Communism was seen as evil. Now it would seem that communism (Marxism) is absolutely fine, no problem, let’s all hold hands and sing The Red Flag!! But whatever you do, don’t you dare Wrongthink!!\nThere not interested in helping them, they do what they do to for there own selfish needs they actually don’t give a shit about Black people. BLM leader has acquired 4 mansions in WHITE areas in America, by fraudulently using the Blm go fund me page donations they received off Good hearted people supporting there cause. They are vile and should not be supported in any way. They are a Marxist group who want to rise to the top and stamp out our way of life, there as bad as Isis if not worse. There been funded by hi tech company’s, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, T. Mobile, Pfizer, capital one and many more, our football league, yorkshire tea. It’s all one big load of bull and people need to stop swallowing and falling for there bull shit.\nAn amazing article. Makes me think I’m not going mad. Not the only one thinking it.\n‘You never compromise with violence.\nYou never compromise with intimidation.\nYou never compromise with those who want to use it to extinguish freedom and democracy, because if you do then the very things for which you stand are extinguished.’\nMargaret Thatcher\nThis is nothing more than another opportunity to damage the West, every other country these people should be demonstrating in will not, how long do you think they would last in any of the Middle East countries, China, Russia and many more countries, I, for one, would love to see them demonstrate in North Korea! If they are that dedicated to that cause then let them go to these places and stay out of countries that are leading the way for their causes anyway! They won’t simply because it is not in their agenda to destroy democracy! This is one so called political movement that must be proscribed as a terrorist organisation!\nChurchill was also a piss artist, but if celebrity-oriented newspapaers and magazine refused to publish articles about drinkers, there wouldn’t be much left.\nWell said alan\nThey won’t go to country’s like Korea and Russia because they couldn’t get away with what there getting away with here. They would be shot and not with rubber bullets we are easy pickings because we will bend over backwards to show we are not racist.\nThere are black people that are racist to in fact there’s some form of racism in most cultures. We cannot have a lawless society it is said that more black people are stopped and searched and more are arrested. While I believe there possibly is racism in some police but not all instead of putting the numbers out there and graphs as comparison to white people it may help if someone put a graph out there where they were guilty of a crime and there would be justification of the arrest. As much as I believe some racism still exists on both sides this is England with western ways and standards and don’t believe that we should allow our country to be torn apart and changed because someone demands it. Perhaps we should start calling the race card ourselves they don’t want us to fly our own flag other country’s fly there flags do why are they not ranting to them. We speak English but sometimes Jamaicans speak pattwa even when born here we don’t have a problem with that but if our heritage is to be stripped then that can work both ways. Personally I think we have come along way this going on about the slave trade it was disgusting but it also was 400 years ago. If we all start going back in time there will be country’s at war all over the world.\nSit down and talk and compromise on both sides not all one sided demands.\nThe majority of children in this country get the same education black and white. If someone wants to do well then attend school put the work in and that goes for all. But don’t not attend school half the time come out with nothing and demand a job way above your capability and when it’s not given say it’s racism. The older generation of this country have good work ethics black and white but younger people want it all on a plate black and white.\nHit the nail on the head\nWhat Tracy said..\nYou talk about slavery being 400 years ago. Have a look at open air Libya Slave markets and see if you change your mind.\nThe slave trade in America ended 150 years ago, not 400. The effects of both it and segregation are very much at work today. This video is an excellent (brief) summary: https://youtu.be/AGUwcs9qJXY\nThe statistics for our (UK) police system are readily available for those interested. As are the statistics for white people who commit crimes and the sentences they are given vs. minority groups.\nRacial bias within education is also well documented. As are the affects of poverty on children. Speaking as a teacher, I can assure you most children who come from impoverished backgrounds are certainly not given ‘the same education’, when you delve into the disparity between inherited wealth and how it affects minorities it becomes an even more apparent issue.\nCaroline are you saying that you don’t teach minority groups the same, are they taught differently to white children, are they put in separate rooms. Do they have a different teacher to the white kids, of course they don’t, all children in this country are given exactly the same start in life when they begin school but how their parents/guardians/communities encourage this is not, even some parents of white children don’t give a toss what their kids are doing so good education stems from good parenting regardless of wealth. I know some extremely well educated people in mega paid jobs who come from poor families and some very wealthy parents who’s children are total wasters.\nDo you think that only black people come from impoverished backgrounds?\nI grew up in the biggest council estate in Europe and went to bed sometimes as a child hungry because my single parent mum couldn’t afford food.\nBecause I am white however, I obviously had a privileged upbringing didn’t I?\nNo, I didn’t. What I did though after leaving school at the beginning of year 4 (year 10 today) with no qualifications is got a student loan and put myself through uni and got a degree while in my 30s.\nYou get what you work for in this life and no one should have it handed to them on a plate just because of their colour.\nWhat a load of utter nonsense. The biggest problem I see here is the education systems of the world being infiltrated by left wing appears such as yourself filling our kids heads with this false, one sided nonsense!\nCaroline I checked the stats as you suggested since you left it open.\nIn the past 10 years, 163 people have died in police custody in England and Wales according to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nOf these 163 deaths: 140 were WHITE, 13 were BLACK and 10 were from other minority groups.\nThat is a very large amount of white deaths compared to black and minority police deaths wouldn’t you agree?\nThe slave trade argument is utterly absurd. Irish people were not slavers, but muslim slavers for hundreds of years attacked Ireland and kidnapped people. Should Irish people receive reparations and say IRISH LIVES MATTER? Ridiculous! Even if you consider Black Americans, they would still largely have been better off for modern generations than had they remained in their homelands. It’s all irrelevant now. Germany was bombed almost out of existence after WWII with half its men dead and yet was a superpower again in 20 years. Blaming 150 year old history for failure is preposterously stupid.\nBLM started in America based on false premises of systemic racism and black people under attack from racist white people.\nHere’s some reality based on undisputed FBI and ONS statistics : Black people commit violent crimes at 5 x the rate of white people.\nIn race on race crimes more than 90% are BLACK ON WHITE.\nMaybe it’s only against their “white oppressors”. No. A similar pattern is present in crimes against Asians.\nMaybe it’s poverty. No. Studies allowing for welfare packages, household income, assets etc, still show an over representation of crime.\nPolice officers are 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black person than a black person is by police officers.\nBlacks people are over-represented in (real) “race hate crimes” (where race is a factor in the rape, violence etc) against other races and whites are underrepresented.\nApproximately 0.015% of killings of black people is by the police. And consider the enormous amount of violence coming from black people, it’s not a surprise that a few die unnecessarily.\nThe cops are having millions of interactions with black people because there’s so much crime and occasionally it goes wrong when they get violent.\nBLM doesn’t care about black people under the surface. If they did, they would have been more worried about David Dorn, the 75year old former police officer who was murdered during the riots and all the other black people killed in the riots, but they don’t care. They don’t care about the 99.98% of blacks killed who were not killed by police officers. They didn’t care that over the weekend of George Floyd’s tragic death about 19 people were killed in Chicago alone! They don’t care that 70% of black homes are fatherless. They don’t care about the abortion rate in black committees…They don’t care unless, they can pin it on a white person…..and people are sick of this nonsense.\nBLM gain support from naive people with disingenuous use of statistics and often outright lies. BLM keep talking about race, which we should have stopped doing years ago but it makes money for grifters and fuels ant-Western narratives. However if they want to talk about race, it’s WHITE people who should feel disgruntled!\nI agree. Supported my kids education providing tutoring to suppliment school education. (found this out reading Guardian). My back ground, female, white working class; born 1960. Left secondary school with ‘O’ Level Art. Went to college for clerk/typing course. From then on used Night School, now adult education to better myself. Achieved degree after 40; MA in 50’s. Always played catch up with middle class individuals who achieved aqualifications at the appropriate age. The adult education system in this country has been ripped to pieces; including Open University. I would like to see funding for adult ecucation and Open University increased. Adult education gave me the nous to middle class my kids activities CV. TES explained working class youngsters generally stick to one accessable sport, middle class have a variety. Also, I knew to explain to my kids educators that I had a degree; expect my youngsters to attend ‘Uni’ at an appropraite age. Lo; the year head stated there and then at parents evening my kid’s are now viewed as ‘ gifted and able.’ Education gives parents the tool kit to ‘enhance’ outcomes.\nAlso the number of Blacks killed from the end of the Civil War to the Civil Rights era by Lynchings and the KluKluxKlan is exceeded every 6 Months by Black on Black Murders it the USA\nI live in the United States. I believe that this rich poor thing with race is incorrect. Race has nothing to do with a person’s potential. Anyone with a mind and good health can become financially well off. In history, there were poor people who made a difference in this world. One of them was Charles Dickens. In the United States, people say that immigration don’t do well at becoming financially secure. Not everyone. I read that somewhere. My immigrant grandparents were from Russia. They did well here and lived constructive lives. My Mom has ancestors back to the revolutionary war. It does not mean that I am a bad person. I have the right to like who I am without being harassed for my identity. I do have my opinions about what is right and wrong like many people. It seemed like I’m school, I was someone not to like. I don’t understand. In the United States, it is all about physical appearance no matter what your heritage is. My sister changed her physical appearance my going under the knife. I hope that she was not bullied for physical appearance. It makes me feel like Americans go too far. I learned to ignore people who are ignorant, judgmental and hypocritical. My ex friend who told me that she is part Native American and from the Mohican tribe tells me that I don’t understand. What I don’t understand is that I did not ask her and I could care less. It is strange hearing from people who I don’t know why they tell me that they are part Native American when I did not ask, I stand there looking like a fool while I noticed their lighter eyes and they aren’t even dark complected. I found out that I am part Hispanic recently. All of these people who regarded me as a racist do not know my heritage or anything at all about me except that I practice Judaism. It seems real and has been happening for a long time that Jewish Americans are regarded as racists. If you don’t believe me, then why would someone scream at me, “You White Jewish Bitch!” They got away with this. I was treated like myself being verbally abused and harassed was fine and acceptable. I see Americans showing acceptance to hatred against people who they might feel deserve it. If you don’t believe me, why do you think someone would scream, “Blondie, skinhead, redneck!” It is immature. Basically, I live in a country with many immature people. It seems like people of all backgrounds have their immature people. We keep on saying that it is unlawful for someone to harass a person only for their appearance or heritage. I look Austrian as hell. I am blended. I don’t understand why people talk talk about themselves as they are better than me. If you don’t believe me, then why do they holler that I have racial issues. For many years in my life, I came to realize that possibly the whole world is color blind and in denial about their prejudices, hate, biased opinions, ethnocentrism and their need to feel better than a certain group. I never met anyone who told the truth that they are a racist like myself. I guess that people have to feel great. It seems grandiose. I am blended. I was told who to love. I can go on and on about how people do not want to admit that they are prejudiced. The man who screamed at the top of his lungs at me the first second he saw me, he got really excited when he said he was not racist. Interracial sex does not make someone not prejudiced. I am afraid to have sex because I have been showing signs of endometriosis. I know that sounds inappropriate, but becomes of that, I am best of not doing it so I show interest in no one because I know it will hurt. So stop judging people and stop hating. I have been insulted most of my life. All sorts of insults. Like confused, angry, psycho, schiz, bitch, fuck up, racist, slut, psychotic, oversexed, skinny, fat, pale, homicidal, violent, redneck, insensitive to racial issues and I am supposed to be nice to these idiots. I have also been called an asshole and highly conceited. I don’t see how I could be all of these. I am sorry if I disappointed anyone. Oh yes, my schizophrenia was changed to psychopath after schizophrenia was my diagnosis for over thirty years. I have been harassed. Have you ever met a jerk? I can’t stand people asking me to feel sorry for them. If people stop their ethnocentric thinking and speaking that they are in denial about, maybe I will help, but maybe others need to apologize too. You don’t have to use rudeness and aggressive insults to get us to help you. It just gives us a reason to look down at you. I have friends. I am sorry. When will people stop being hypocrites and saying that I owe Irish, Hispanics and Jewish people when I am one of all of that. If I say that I am blended, that makes me a bad person. There are blended people through history like Diego Rivera. I guess we blended people think differently and get obsessed with the news like it is too important. Anyways, I disagree that Winston Churchill was a racist. Whoever wrote that has no sense. He was antiHitler. The story of Churchill is long. I find him complicated. You may think that I want validation or admiration. No. I just want to shun people who insult others regularly because I am against defamation of personality of dead people who can not defend themselves and their morals. These are just things written from my head that I find interesting and I hope that I get people to like themselves, stop blaming themselves and see that we are all pretty much the same. I mean when it comes to being good. What gets in the way is our environment.\nYou are right Caroline, the statistics are there for all to see. I suggest you take a look at them as you clearly haven’t.\nBlack individuals are over represented in higher education.\nThe highest educational achiever are 1) Chinese origin 2) Indian origin Last) white working class origin.\nThe highest earners are 1) Chinese origin 2) Indian origin Last) white working class origin.\nDo these facts indicate racial bias in education? Please look at ONS website for details.\nMinority individuals commit more crimes proportionally that whites. This might be why there are more in prison. Minority individuals commit more crimes that dictate a longer sentence that whites. That might be why the sentences are longer for minority groups.\nThe number of people killed by police in the UK is trivially small (obliviously not trivial for the individuals before you jump on that). The number of minority groups killed by police is roughly proportionally the same as the proportions that come into contact with the police. Many people compare this to the population figures, but any half decent statistician will tell you this comparison is not appropriate.\nPlease look at ONS website for details.\nI am not for a moment suggesting there is no discrimination in the UK, but just as BLM are (deliberately or ignorantly?) misrepresenting statistics, so are you.\nThe only part I agree with of your comment is the disparity in inherited wealth and the effect this can have.\nHello John\nI am female, white and working class. Born 1960. My education was as per Butler Act 1944. I chosen to use Night School/Adudlt Education to better myself. Indivdual responsibility does not get a mention. My education was designed to relegate me to low paid part-time employment and parenting. I was my decision to achieve a Degree and MA, albiet; very late in the day for me.\nHi Alison.\nIn 1960 there was a definite fight for the black race with segregation and prejudice aplenty but I believe there was also a fight for women’s rights and the gay community too.\nThese were issues worth fighting and uniting for at the time but in 2020, it is a completely different, far more free and tolerant world but I clearly see a neo Marxist divisive movement disguised as BLM trying to create racism and division and they are the ones we should be uniting and fighting against before they create a 1960s style world that they so dearly crave for.\nThese types of people border on evil and at least sick and mentally unwell.\nIn the words of Malcolm X – The white Liberal is the real enemy of the black man, pretending to be his friend but actually using him/her to gain power.\nWe see BLM for what they are masquerading as the friend of black people.\nI think Stacey is repling to the BLM’s narrative on slavery. You are totally right, slavery has continued to exist and trafficked still. But BLM wont take this on because it is againt the narrative, nothing to do with black lives but to persue the ideology of marxism.\nI live in the United States. I have a learning disability. I always try not to sound conceited. I constantly say bad things about myself. I was called a white bitch, psycho, skinhead, redneck, stupid looking, fuck up, piece of shit, retard, racist and a Ted Bundy type. This is crazy. Americans are judgmental. Why do people need to be admired? I work hard during this Covid 19. People tell me that I have it well. I have an anger problem. This racism crap and name calling is stupid and rude. I know that all of those insults are not true. If I don’t agree, I am afraid that I will be put on medicine for grandiosity. That was my early adulthood. My doctor would make sure to bring my ego down. People who talk down to others should look at themselves as people who make no sense. I listen too much to the point that I heard the most ridiculous, nonsensical, egotistical, biased and hypocritical stuff. I guess that most people are in denial that they are not as great as they think so that they put down others. I have been dealing with hypocrites most of my life. I have to protect myself and I feel like no one has empathy so no one will understand. America is too egotistical and ethnocentric. I am American. My friend told me to say nice things about myself. So I did. Then she told me who to love. Everyone brought me down. I hate how Americans talk about their ancestry to me without me asking. I hate how people talk about race to me. It is a sensitive topic. No one obviously seems to do it correctly without offending someone or making themselves looking like the best person in the world.\nI am aware that Churchill liked a drink, he was possibly one of the few that remained overweight during the war, however, I don’t think a pisshead could have rallied up such hope and belief in our darkest hour than Churchill did with his well executed speeches.\nRegards, tabloids and magazines etc, the mainstream lie and produce so much fake news, they would never run out of material to publish\nThat’s one of the truest and frank comments I have read.\nVery well put.\nTracey, very good comment, articulate and succinct. It says what most people are thinking and most will agree with!\nI think what Caroline is saying is that we need to take into consideration the legacy of past events. It’s a well-documented fact that people are more likely to do well if their parents did well. This does not make it impossible if you’re from an impoverished background – just more challenging.\nNow imagine the situation where one of those obstacles is simply the colour of your skin -which you have little choice over; or your gender or sexual preferences – all of which hurt no one, but make certain people see you as inferior before even giving you the chance to prove yourself.\nThat’s the truth DJ. Inconvenient truths that will bring down a whole world of anger and retribution on your head, but true all the same.\nTrue to some extent. I have a bilateral cleft lip and palette. I am a white, working class female born 1960. My education was affected, constant disability related discrimination from staff and pupils. I chosen to used adult education throughout my life for self betterment. Yes, class and disability can have a negative effect; I chose to spend my own money to access eduction.\nGreat Article,let’s hope this message can get across to people,I have no great education,but have seen through this charade from the start\nGreat Article,let’s hope this message gets across to all involved in this pathetic kneeling competition.\nThank you for such great article. I’m glad I’m not going crazy or creating conspiracies. Growing up in a socialist regime, I had to learn about Marx and Lenin and their ideology. We also learnt about the Great October Socialist Revolution and how it “freed” the oppressed class. What I see happening in the world right now fills me with dread because it’s starting to look very familiar. In socialism, we were told what to chant, what to say, how to behave, what to think. Please don’t be fooled, there was no freedom or democracy in socialism! If you didn’t agree, if you dared to express a different opinion, you were the class’ enemy and you had to be rid off!! People lost jobs, their children suffered for their fathers’ “crimes”. That is if they were not thrown in jail or “accidently” fell out of windows. The secret police were everywhere, monitoring and watching your every move. I’ll just say this: be very careful who and what you support. Racism and discrimination still needs to be tackled on a global level for everybody who’s experiencing it! What does BLM want? I’ve asked this question so many times, why is it not made clear?? Many of us would say, they fight racism. Correct but there is more! It’s a neo-Marxist party dreaming of a communism whilst hiding behind a cause that’s close to people’s hearts. Don’t be surprised if calls to abolish the UK police are to follow because without the police, the socialist coup will be right on track. People will be so brainwashed by that point, that it’s going to sound like the perfect idea…just like it’s happening in the US! The first thing you do in a coup, you take control of the country’s official media (BBC) to manipulate peoples’ opinion. It won’t matter what colour you are. We’ll all suffer. When you forget who you are, when you are told who you are, it’s easier to control you. Don’t let anyone brainwash you! Scary times indeed. More than we realise.\nI so agree Lucia. I grew up in communist Czechoslovakia and I can see the same. It’s scary, the rhetoric is the same. The same damn Marxist bullshit that we thought we’d kicked 30 years ago. Apparently not!!! I feel I need to tell people here about my experience but when I do, so many say, ah, socialism is not the same as communism. They make excuses for Venezuela’s dire state, blaming it on corruption, not on their communist ideology. It’s so naive, and ever so frustrating to hear. We have to speak up, us that still remember what the left is truly capable of when given the opportunity.\nExcellent article Ben. We all need to be mindful of the need to resist jumping on board the resentment bandwagon, for I fear we are getting close to a significant reaction from ordinary people. The next hot-spot will be Extinction Rebellion. If they take to the streets and prevent people from going about their lawful occasion and the police do nothing I fear people will start taking the law into their own hands. We will then be in dangerous territory. I feel we are pressure cooker at the moment, and when ordinary, peaceful, people like myself are getting very angry at the failure of Government and Institutions to stand up to this Woke movement something will have to give. I just wonder if our current crop of politicians have a clue about feelings outside the M25.\nThe far left have a stranglehold on the media, the Labour Party, socialist leaning voters and dangerously are whitewashing history. The United Kingdom historically has a class system, some argue that this class system has been removed or watered down, with line blurred between ever transient social hierarchies. But it is a fallacy, class is clearly the main driver of social issues still today, so why are the liberal left ignoring the elephant in the room?\nI have repeatedly been dictated to, lately, that white people do not and cannot understand the social struggles of black people in the United Kingdom. I have watched on in horror as, largely, prominent white British figures have spread this concept across social media, and ordinary white Britons have bowed to this ideology. And it’s a false narrative. Leaving aside the obvious discrimination Jews, LGBT+ communities, the Irish and many more have faced in the United Kingdom, historically, we merely have to look at an average Joe like myself to blow this idea that white people cannot suffer discrimination out of the water.\nMy grandmother came to Britain from Germany, she married a British soldier, she spoke English, she worked and paid into the system. She also faced systemic racism daily, being physically and verbally assaulted many times. Most of my family were traditionally coal miners, my young memories are full of the struggles of the 1984/85 strike, the flying pickets, the mounted police charging our community, the injustice of mocked up arrests and convictions and the death and burial of one of our miners who was killed on the picket.\nLeaving aside the politics of the strike and it’s legacy I was a child in a land where my own police force were ordered by my own Government to use violence, where our legal system was used to wrongfully convict many (including my father) for crimes that were later proven to be fabricated by police officers. I was shamed at school for wearing free clothes, I gladly accepted Christmas gifts from the Soviet Union, I spent a freezing winter half starving to death all for nought.\nI learned a great deal from this, I was the first of my family to go to university, the first of my family to question why Labour nor the Conservatives ever did anything to replace the chasm left behind by the loss of coal mining in villages like mine (still today one of the most deprived areas in Europe) and the first to really grasp the idea that systemic abuse of working class, lower class (whatever arbitrary tag you wish to use) people is the actual divide our leading political bodies use to control our entire economy, control our very existence.\nWhilst equality for all is a just concept and indeed racism of all forms does need to be stamped out of our lives the far left have successfully hijacked the Black Lives Matters protest to pour fuel on the fire and divide us once more. The quicker the ordinary, non-wealthy families and individuals of all race, religion or any other minority identity realise that we are being played for fools by the establishment, the quicker we can make real change.\nAnd yes, ALL people can suffer discrimination, I refuse to allow leftist zealots dictate to me that isn’t true, whilst I stand shoulder to shoulder with my brothers and sisters from all creeds in their struggle for equality.\nWell said – many , many people saying Amen to that attitude . The government could be about to lose much support for not being seen to care about the ordinary decent working people of this country .\nthis Government is awful and it certainly it certainly does not represent the Country as a whole full of entitled buffoons who have never done a proper Day’s work in their lives\nMatthew, I don’t agree that the establishment is “playing us for fools”. That kind of generalising statement is meaningless really. If you’re implying that the establishment (whatever that is) is deliberately conspiring to keep the little people down, then that is false. If the “establishment” is the likes of politicians (local and national), the police, the judiciary, the military, the civil service etc., then it has never been more accessible for people of any background to join its ranks. Does the medical profession and the scientific community count as the establishment? Is there still an asset owning “aristocracy”? Possibly, but that has dwindled considerably. What we are talking about is “money”, not “class”. Whilst we don’t live in a meritocratic utopia (if such a thing exists) education and social advancment has never been more accessible. You were the son of a coal miner.. but worked hard and advanced. I am the son of a doctor, had every privilege and yet still nearly dropped out of university through sheer laziness – before I bucked my ideas up and realised I had to work hard to advance. Whilst there is a lot to the establishment I dislike, the idea that it is “playing ordinary people for fools” when many thousands from ordinary backgrounds are eagerly joining its ranks every year doesn’t add up. Or are they traitors? Take Keir Starmer.. decidely ordinary background.. but eagerly joins the establishment via the legal profession. Maybe Grammar Schools are the best meritocratic social advancment tool? Keir went to one.\nAnyway, one thing we can agree on is that the BLM narrative is mostly false (or at least dishonestly selective) and incredibly divisive.\nThis is a fantastic article and really sums up how I am feeling right now. I am fearful of what lies ahead. I can’t even switch on my television any more, as its all so one sided. I am truly sickened. At least I know I am not alone in all of this!!\nMatthew, I agree with most of what you say there but you use the term “the left” and the “far left” throughout. There is no doubt that the far left will be supportive of and even involved in these riots and protests, but to believe that their philosophy is what’s primarily driving it is to misunderstand what’s going on here in my opinion.\nI see the main philosophy behind these groups as being extreme liberalism or what the great British philosopher John Gray calls the “alt liberals”. Alt liberalism consists of two main elements – extreme social liberalism and extreme economic liberalism.\nIt’s obvious that most of these protesters are social liberals I.e they aren’t cultural conservatives, but they’re also backed up by the aerial firepower of big business I.e. economic liberalism. Just look at the amount of corporates showing their unequivocal support for BLM in the last few days e.g. Yorkshire tea, PG tips etc\nIt’s important that we understand the nature of what we are up against and it’s not just the traditional left but also the economic liberals of the “free market” right,”Woke Capitalism” as it’s sometimes known.\nA really informative artical and something that all rational people should realise is happening. The very fa t that MSN have broadcast any facts about Geirge Floyd’s criminal activities but have in fact elevated him to a latter day saint has distorted what was a brutal act committed by the police and for which the perpetrators will be punished into a struggle against racist white society fueled by a left wing press which is constantly praising BLM and criticising any one who has alternative views. We have to stand up against this .manipulation of the truth or we descend I to anarchy. Appeasement didn’t work before the second world war and it wont now because we should all understand that the destruction of our history and Democracy is the final goal\nWell said Christina.\nSo ! slavery started when Africans were transported to America. Of course it didn’t. It has been carried out long before inner Africa was even discovered. After wars and battles the losers were taken or sold into slavery. Soon we will have to change the History books to suit BLM. To me this is BLM fuelling Racism.\nThank you, Ben, for this superb and nuanced article explaining the psychological and behavioral aspects of this in simple, understandable terms. As you say, it’s a “protection racket […] with no possible limits and no end in sight, [none of which] can be criticised without appearing to oppose the idea that black lives do indeed matter. […] Either get on board or you’re a racist”\nEvery single brand and corporation is bending over backwards to make themselves look as virtuous as possible – as you say, out of fear. They’re all trying to cover their arse. An absolutely mad sentence I read on BBC News earlier: “Yorkshire Tea said it had not yet commented on the BLM protests as it had been ‘taking time to educate itself'”. Apparently we live in a world where people expect their cup of tea or their lawnmower or their foot spa to share the same ideological beliefs as them. Or at least that’s what brands and the media seem to think… in reality I doubt most people care. Whatever side of a given argument you’re on, it’s a sad indictment of our debate culture in the current day and age that this is the form that people’s engagement with societal issues increasingly takes. Can I still use Persil washing powder if I don’t know their stance on intersex rights? What if my breakfast is transphobic? It’s this absurd, unholy alliance of online mass contagion and consumerism. Brands have been great at harnessing online movements in order to convince people that consuming products is a virtuous and even political act, one that helps you be a Good Person – by going to see Captain Marvel you’re not just watching a Hollywood blockbuster made by a megacorporation but supporting feminism, by drinking Yorkshire Tea you’re even combating US police brutality(!). We see brands pandering to the populist right to some extent too (albeit perhaps lesser), in the way British flags are increasingly slapped on all kinds of products to play up their “Britishness” in the hope of boosting sales, and in the creation of a kind of patriotic supermarket brand like Jack’s. This kind of consumer activism has always happened on a smaller scale of course – I have a friend who hasn’t bought anything Nestle for decades, another who stopped visiting Wetherspoon’s over Tim Martin’s Brexit stance, and my parents boycotted South African fruit and fruit juice in the 80s over apartheid – but those feel more like personal, individual choices, not borne out of internet-mediated mass participatory phenomena.\nIn the US and UK, the left has more cultural and symbolic power than ever (and this is leaching into institutions and consumer brands), but the right has more actual political and economic power than ever. Neither of these is a good thing and each exacerbates the other – the more our culture and public life tacks toward the hard left, the more ordinary people tack towards the (populist or hard) right in the voting booth and in their personal sentiments. And the more political power the populist right then gains, the more the left responds in the only way it knows how to these days, via institutions, cultural spaces, symbolic gestures and internet-mediated mass participatory movements that make you feel like you’re doing something Good but which don’t actually achieve anything in practical or human terms. It’s a push-me-pull-you. The centre cannot hold… but the centre is still there underneath this, on any suburban street you walk down.\nIn terms of how the public will respond to the current wave of BLM hysteria, I really don’t think the British Asian community is going to stand for this. I don’t even think a lot of black British people will be on board with what’s being done in their name at the moment in this country, especially older ones. This is being driven by woke millennials (of all creeds) and middle-class white liberals. Moreover, British Asians are in a fortunate position where they can speak out about this critically and vociferously without being labeled racist (or even if they are, as some tried to do with Patel, it doesn’t stick or gain momentum in the way it often does when a white person is labeled racist). This can benefit us all. As you suggest, the further this goes, the more it will unite ordinary people of all races against what’s being done in the name of progress. In addition to most British Asians and older black British people not being not being signed up to the woke agenda, there’s also our significant and well-integrated eastern European populace in the UK, who are very much not going to be on board with BLM etc. as they have no concept of white liberal guilt – the whole idea is completely alien to them, as their countries were never involved in colonialism in the first place, they generally have more traditional small-c conservative values than the average white Brit, and the vast majority of them are from backgrounds that are the very opposite of privileged. Coming from post-communist countries, they also have a healthy suspicion of mass movements, slogans and propaganda, as well as lived experience of the huge harm done by hard left ideology.\nPeople of all creeds in this country have a basic desire for security, stability, law and order. The more that TV news reports show frightening footage of multi-ethnic mobs defacing statues and war memorials, rioting, attacking businesses and vandalizing public spaces, all seemingly unhindered by police, the more it’s going to inflame racial tensions in this country and push people (of all ethnicities) further away from the left (even the rational centre-left, what little of it still remains) and more towards hard-right politics, until we end up with a kind of Orban-state. I can barely think of a better way to radicalise white people in this country (the vast majority of whom don’t identify as white) that to start taking down comedy shows from iPlayer to appease a tiny minority. I always thought Little Britain was rubbish myself, but this is such a transparently venal and counterproductive decision, particularly the BBC’s line that “times have changed” when tons of people flagged up how witless and cruel the show was at the time – particularly in relation to how it portrayed disabled people, it was almost less a sketch show than a bullying manual. But the BBC essentially officially declaring Lucas and Walliams racist (which I don’t believe to be the case) is a shocking precedent for anyone in the creative sectors and anyone in public life. If we’re indeed entering an era where all kinds of cultural artefacts can be declared haram even by the organizations that made them, and people can be declared unpersons by their own former employers, all out of institutional cowardice, we’re gonna need better fucking samizdat that Little bloody Britain.\nwolfstar, great comment\nExcellent wolfstar.\nI could kiss you for this reply. Bravo.\nI could kiss you for this reply, Wolfstar. Bravo.\nI first wanted to post a comment for such a brilliant article; however, now I believe what you wrote is even better.\nI am here in the US and you have just so intelligently and perfectly described my thoughts and feelings that I no longer feel like I’m going mad. This is the EXACT atmosphere here. I hope both of our countries pull through in tact.\nThank you Wolfstar. Bravo !\nWhat can I say, thank you thank you for posting this! I am also in the US and beginning to feel like I must be the only person feeling this way. Absolutely stunned by what I’m seeing, and I’m afraid to share my feelings with anyone lest I be labeled a racist.\nIt’s truly frightening. This is so well stated and the comments are amazing. I wish this message and alternative way of viewing this issue could be seen by more people. I had a terrible time finding anything on the internet to support my views.\nThank you thank you!\nCan someone provide a list of pro blm organisations so that I can boycott them?\nI think you’re a bit harsh on Little Britain. Walliams and Lucas were superb comedic actors, and in the glorious tradition of Brit Comedy (a tradition that has died because of woke-ism) they mercilessly ripped the proverbial out of any group they saw fit via outrageous and absurd characters.\nStill, give an inch to the BLM narrative and they’ll take a mile, cancel everything they dislike, and the woke left will eat itself – as Walliams and Lucas found out!\nI was thinking of starting a campaign WNWCLM — white northern working class lives matter. When it comes to deprivation and early death this group suffer more than most other groups in the country. We should start to rip down statues of mine owners and industrialists. Send donations to Dave. I would put an address but I don’t expect much support.\nNo word of a lie, my father gathered us all (via messaging) to tell us he has drafted up a legal document to sit aside his will, that includes multiple references to and evidence of his mining related health issues. Why? Because he came from nothing, worked himself into a withered shadow of himself for his country for many years as a miner then for the NHS when forced to retrain, and he is terrified his own Government will use any trick in the book to use Covid related death (should it happen) to deny his family the proceeds of his pension etc.\nThe far right are using the fears and isolation of working class people who have been left behind as the perfect example of why all immigrants are bad, the far left are using this fear of immigrants as an excuse to try to overturn the EU referendum result. All that’s left behind are entire communities of working class people who are disenfranchised and taught to blame people by the political and media elite when really the blame lies at the feet of successive Labour, Conservative and coalition Governments who have abandoned these communities to their fates. The lurch away from Labour in many of these communities in recent years is the proof in the (Yorkshire) pudding.\nThe more Labour lurches left, the more those communities lurch to the right.\nGreat comment, especially about the effect this will have on Eastern European immigrants. Something I hadn’t thought of. Unfortunately at present, our east European friends don’t have much influence politically.\nSuperb piece of writing.\nI wish I had done it myself.\nBesides the obvious power grab and grift for a copy pasta manifesto with primary causes changed. This could easily be for extinction Rebellion, just change race references to Environment. they are praying on the good nature of people in the country and deliberately dividing communities by choosing divisive topics.\nAll of a sudden you don’t want Greys Monument removed, or Captain Cook, or you support the work of the police force, then you must be inherently racist, and that means fascist. at which point they can point at you Label you Far Right, get you fired and ostracised, because you cannot understand why a memorial to Lord Leverhulme was removed.\nThis is forcibly dividing communities along a line that hardly ever existed, and through forcing one action they can force the next, it will become a long string of purity tests,\nDeclare that Black Lives matter\nSlavery is Bad\nMonuments to Slavery must be torn down\nModern instruments of Oppression must be revised\nThe Police are an oppressive force\nthe structure of govt needs to promote our voices more\nElevation of Lobby group status\nForced say on Committee and Board decisions to ensure goals fully represented\nVote to have Mandatory inclusion in All future Law decision and revision of existing poilicies\nElevation of movement as a political entity\nElection\nThe moment you fail at any of these steps you will be “othered”\nThe BLM movement / Organisation comes with so much political baggage that it cannot be ignored as well, “that is just a few people,”. this IS a Political Power group, and even if they never establish the party they will continue to proceed with social pressure, till that everyone will just accept that the have tacit approval.\nThis cannot come to pass, it is bad enough having already Powerful over reaching lobby groups that think their farts don’t stink (eg Greenpeace) and a agenda driven publicly funded media powerhouse behind them. they need to be given full honest exposure to the masses of what their actual aims are, what they actually stand for, and how they are going to achieve them. BLM need to do this without causing rifts in communities that NEVER existed before, and they need to de-escalate the manufactured outrage that they have created IMMEDIATELY.\nAs to the Discussions on statues, Fine Have them, in each community, as for reformation of police practices if required have them where applicable, the Majority of the UK is not London (shocker I know). Decisions have already been made that hadn’t entered the heads of the MPs Mayors etc 48 hours earlier, and now they are top priority and being enacted with a speed I didn’t even know a public servant was capable of.\nThe British People would be more than happy to help stop Racism and Slavery in the world today, BLM is not Interested, instead it is creating mindless doctrinal drones, for their own exploitation and capital gain, (Companies assist us with your profits), and as far as I know hasn’t even mentioned modern day actual slavery,\nEvery refresh of Twitter currently holds news of, another celebrity donating or kneeling, another company promising funds and Jobs, or even swapping out existing employees for Black people, and on the other side, people refusing to take the knee are being doxxed harassed forced to resign sacked by companies or silenced, this is not cultural acceptance or integration it is the formation of a self policing supplicant class to be ran by a Star chamber court.\nLegitimate concerns from this organisation should be addressed, but as it stands this current surrender to BLM is morally and culturally unacceptable in Britain and should be treated as an insurrectionist movement\nTotally agree with all of the above. Thank you for writing this.\nThe problem we have to wrestle with is that for all the drivel BLM has on its gofundme site there is some justification for the attack on the targets they are currently choosing.\nFor Colston, the case is pretty clear. The fact that the statue was erected in 1895, 174 years after Colston’s death and at a time when there was no moral ambiguity about slavery, tells us unambiguously that its erection was a political choice. Its demolition was too, even though it was accomplished in an unacceptable manner.\nSo Colston is easy. But to get at the nub of the question, we have to be prepared to go deeper. So let’s take a look at Churchill. Was Churchill a racist and an imperialist? Yes of course, to his very marrow he was both these things. But he was also probably the only man who was capable of ensuring that Britain didn’t lose the war immediately, and consequently that Eurasia wasn’t plunged indefinitely into the wicked and eliminationist racist barbarism of Nazism. He really was the man who rescued and preserved civilization at a time when it seemed lost. Did he do it for the Jews, the Slavs and all the other collection of ‘untermenschen’ Hitler wanted enslaved or dead? Not really, he did it because he recognized evil when he saw it, and knew that fighting it went hand in glove with his secondary treasured project – preserving the British Empire.\nIf the question asked is: ‘Which is more important, Churchill’s role in rescuing and preserving civilization, or the fact that he held racist and imperialist instinct when he did it?’ then the answer should, must, be clear. Particularly so if you belong to one of the many ethnic groups that Hitler saw as ‘untermenschen’.\nWhat, then, fires the attack on Churchill by BLM or its hangers-on? Any explanation must include ‘thoughtlessness’. I think we also have to acknowledge that this thoughtlessness goes hand in glove with a joy in anger and hatred, and the exultation which comes with mob violence.\nI think it is not wrong to point out the similarities of this attack on history, this righteous attack on civility as sharing the same characteristics with China’s Cultural Revolutionaries. The denigration of national history, the power of the mob, the totalitarian demand for public abasement of the supposed ‘leaders’ to ‘take a knee’, and, no doubt coming soon, we’ll have the abject ‘self-criticisms’ demanded, written and published by leading academics, civic leaders, media types. How long before some elderly academic collapses under the force of the attack? Perhaps we’ll see train fares waived as BLM leaders travel the country to extend their mission to places so far left unmolested.\nNor should we ignore that people have been working diligently and imaginatively over decades to reach this point. This is not so much about the triumph of ‘cultural Marxism’ as a re-surfacing of ever-present human instincts we’d prefer to ignore. For those with time on their hands, I’d recommend ‘The Cultivation of Hatred’, by Peter Gay as a guide to how these instincts played out in the middle classes in the Victorian era. Hatred has been, and is, being cultivated in the middle classes, and we begin to see its fruits.\nWe should recognize the instinct is totalitarian, which is the opposite and enemy of civilization. In the SDP we seek to foster and support those institutions which go to support and build society for all its people, of whatever race, class, age or accomplishment. So we must oppose the righteous justification of the mob, condemn and isolate those pandaring to it, most importantly in our public institutions.\nBut at the same time, since we know humanity is messy, our timber crooked, we shouldn’t be afraid of the argument, even to the point of accepting it in some cases (ie, like Colston). Isaiah Berlin wrote, ‘total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs, total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted.’ Right now power is with the mob: we should protect the lambs.\nNice thoughts Michael. Agreeing 100%. I’ve always thought there was a case for taking down some statues and one of the few positives about this movement is that we’re debating it in public life, albeit leavened with far too much hysteria and mob rule. Cheers, Ben\nOn your points about the ‘messy’ nature of BLM and other assorted ‘hangers on’ I totally agree. And yes, thoughtlessness is a big part of this. The call for the removal of statues, renaming of streets because of their ties to various cultural and social atrocities in the past by people who will ironically will likely use products and services created by companies and individuals who created wealth from slavery, the opium trade, the holocaust and so on is not lost on me.\nI fully support the call for a more rounded education to be taught, to allow Britons of all backgrounds to understand the legacy of figures from our shared past, but worry that mindless mob rule leading the tearing down of statues shows that many in that mob are really as uneducated as anyone.\nThis is highlighted by the guidance given by Anthony Joshua this week for black people to use black services and shops, whilst taking in millions of pounds in sponsorship from Hugo Boss et al, who have very well documented links to actual fascism. How long will it be until the mob realise that many companies and institutions around the world have very clear and easily traced links to slavery etc and call for boycotts of them? A United Kingdom without Coca-Cola, Barclays, Audi etc will be a United Kingdom with an economy issue.\nI don’t for a moment think the far left will go that far, because it’s plainly ridiculous but it has given me food for thought as business after business have spent the last fortnight desperately trying to appear ‘woke’ to the masses on social media, just how wary they are that the left will realise that there is not a corner of the United Kingdom that has not in some way benefited from Empire and the ills of it.\nBLM has a problem on its hands in the UK with regards to every silent ‘high achieving’ black individual across all spheres who has caught the black cab to white Buckingham Palace to accept an honour. From Trevor McDonald to Anthony Joshua, they’ve all taken a knee and it’s high time BLM’s leaders (whoever they are) take a good look at the hypocrisy in their own ranks before attempting, futilely, to whip up white collective guilt.\nThank you. Spot on.\nso well put. I know a few myself\nI enjoyed the article and agreed with it. I’m glad that people like Ben are able to write, for the time being at least, these articles that give an alternative to the BBC liberal elite viewpoint. It’s not just the BBC though, I have just been watching the Jeremy Vine show where JV himself and 3 panelists all took the same track, that taking down statues all over Britain is a great idea and needs to happen. No alternative viewpoint presented.\nYet I saw a poll yesterday that showed there is no majority anywhere in the UK for taking down the statues. But once again the alt liberal viewpoint is presented as being the will of the people and the majority is shut out from having a say.\nIt seems Black lives Matter is just another subgroup of a wider movement which is Destroy Western Culture.\nI am totally opposed to slavery everywhere.\nExcellent article.\nIt explains everything I’ve been thinking, everything that has irritated me, everything that has infuriated me for the past week.\nI am ashamed of certain factions in my country in their lemming-like, genuflecting response to a total sham.\nThank you for writing it: I feel a lot better for the first time in a while.\nI AGREE. BLM IS A SET UP TO DIVIDE US. THE LIVE AND LET LIVE SOCIETY HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY HARD LEFT ACTIVISTS. INTENT ON DESTROYING WESTERN SOCIETY. FOLLOWED BY THE BRAINWASHED ELITE.\nThe piece, and subsequent comments, echo my own thoughts and those of so many. We’re afraid of standing up, but now we have to. Slavery is and was wrong. Racism is wrong. Erasing history because you don’t like it, equally so.\nDemocracy MUST prevail, or all is lost. What we’re seeing isn’t democracy, it’s not a majority, it’s a minority, not in the ethnic but political sense, that is using a climate of finger pointing fear to force through an agenda that benefits no one except their cause. It won’t fix inner city gang culture. It won’t fix issues brought about by closed cultural communities. It won’t fix an economy that we’re going to shortly find out is on it’s knees.\nThis is solely and completely about driving a wedge, and the majority must resist, rise above the noise and take back the high ground.\nBrilliant article.\nYou have encapsulated the whole malady so well and I hope this piece will get circulated widely, albeit somewhat clandestinely (can’t believe I just wrote that – an indication of where we are at!).\nI’m not an SDP member but have been following you for a while. I would suspect that your ideas would resonate with a great many people (maybe even a majority) but you need to seriously raise your profile to get heard. It’s OK bouncing ideas around on here but you are preaching to the converted (me included). Make some more fuss and noise and start getting noticed…please!\nEvery journey starts with a single step. Take out a membership now (£5 I think), and help build the party. Britain needs an opposition, and neither the ‘Labour’ party nor the ‘LibDems’ are in any fit state to provide it. You would be very welcome.\nWhilst I agree with some of the context, I do feel it needs to be a little more balanced. There is absolutely inequality in the worl (some places more than others) and the issue to be resolved is that people have to”fight” for that equality. I’m not just talking about BLM I’m talking about all types of discrimination – sex, disability, race etc etc. Some people believe that as there are “laws’ that are there to protect us, then it doesn’t exist. To that I say – absolute tosh! It is still endemic, and I witness it multiple times a day. Working in a corporate environment, working with major consultancies – not just on social media. Only this week I was mentoring somebody who was struggling to deal with somebody who was leaving the organisation as he was sick of dealing with comments such as “you’re pretty good for a brown guy”. Whilst most people would agree that this is an out and out racist remark, there are a lot who think racism is when you call people names, or refer to the colour of their skin. What they don’t get is the overall context of inequality – if you are deaf and have to have a drs appointment, you have to fight to have a signer there, if you are female, you have to fight to make yourself heard in “the old boys club”.\nAnybody who thinks this isn’t real needs to look more than superficially.\nOh absolutely. I’m gay and was never able to be out in my former workplaces, in one of which I would hear work colleagues throw around words like “Paki” and “poof”. The glass ceiling and pink ceiling are real. That’s not even mentioning US police brutality and impunity, which is absolutely horrific in a way that I think is hard for people outside America to understand. What happened to Floyd is disgusting and stomach-churning, and it’s just the tip of the iceberg. At the same time, I think BLM’s strategy (as with most social justice campaigns in the past several years) is incredibly counterproductive and is only going to lead to a huge backlash from the middle of society. On top of which, the panicky corporate response by all kinds of organizations desperately trying to make themselves look as anti-racist as possible is perhaps causing even more harm than the actual campaign, certainly with respect to public perception. From all the time I’ve spent in eastern Europe, I’m extremely concerned about the ideological Maoist feel to all of this. Tearing down statues one day, broadcasters pulling Little Britain and Gone With The Wind from streaming services the next, NPR running articles on how to “decolonize your bookshelf”… the scope for anything and everything (including people) to be declared haram is infinite. Unrelated to BLM but part of the same phenomenon, there’s already a huge and embittered campaign against JK Rowling for her various political stances. Ironic that in the 90s it was US Christian fundamentalists burning her books because they contained “witchcraft”, now it’s the secular left-wing millennials who grew up cherishing her books who’re lining up to denounce her. I’ve certainly disagreed with her in the past but I respect her honesty and sincerity – the level of hate and ignorance directed towards her for espousing The Wrong Opinion is extraordinary.\nDouglas Murray brings up the interesting point that gays on average out-earn straight people in modern western society. He jokes about “gay privilege”. (Don’t forget he is allowed to because he’s actually gay). I for one work in environments where there is no disadvantage being brown or gay or whatever. All people care about is if you can do your job and can get along in a team. We have had a few people who couldn’t blame their lack of success on their colour or sex or whatever, but if you look on average our failures were evenly spread amongst hetero, white, black, women, men, whatever. It’s just that certain people had less potential excuses.\n“What happened to Floyd is disgusting and stomach-churning, and it’s just the tip of the iceberg”.\nWorse things happen every single day in Sub Saharan Africa. George Floyd was hardly another Martin Luther King\nThank you for your well balanced article, I personally am so angry by this lemming reaction that I actually don’t know what to do next. When I have put up posts and Facebook from black people who haven’t followed the movement for very valid reasons, as you say I get no reaction or likes as people are reluctant to flow in the opposite direction.\nAs a country we have bent over backwards to accept and include people from all over the world to have an inclusive society, where hard work and endeavour will give you every chance to succeed. It’s not perfect of course it’s not but it’s better than most.\nBut I am beginning to feel as a white male in the UK my voice and influence is getting less and has less merit because I am of a certain age, and if I voice an opinion I am a racist and people of colour can say and do as they please.\nAnyway at least I have had an opportunity to get this off my chest.\nThanks for that.\nRegards\nLee\n…I’m a pragmatist and don’t adhere to any extremist agenda. But what I don’t do is become an apologist for things that are intrinsically morally and ethically right so to me black lives matter .\nWhenever confronted by BLM in the media we need to demand an explicit statement of that organisation’s aims. I’m hoping that a lot of people will be horrified as a result. And we need to tell our MPs they’ll lose our votes if they virtue signal about BLM.\nMore white people are killed in police custody in the US than black people. You just don’t hear about it from the left wing media.\nMore white people die in police custody in the UK than Black people. Even when figures are adjusted for numbers and demographics etc, you are still more likely to die in police custody in the UK if you are WHITE!\nTo me, ALL LIVES MATTER! And this isn’t about race.\nAnd until the BLM movement acknowledge this and truly stand for equality rather than non-white superiority then they won’t get my support.\nSorry but the USA is the prime example of a Multi Racial society. They have always had race problems and always will, it has never worked and never will just like Communism. I find Political Correctness and BLM very provoking they try to force people to accept what they do not want, but it just generates more hate.\n, ?\nWhich BBC presenters now openly propagate radical identity politics\nMy God I’ve finally found some people who agree with me\nBLACK LIVES MATTER. All that is being said and all that needs to be said. Think about it and I mean really think about it.\nWe all know that and agree with it. Of course they matter. They matter in the context of terrifying US police brutality, they matter in the context of the history of transatlantic slavery, they matter in the context of NHS staff and other key/frontline workers (many of whom are black or minority ethnic) not being given adequate PPE, and they matter in every other context too.\nThat’s not what this is about. Ben set that out very clearly and many of the comments do too. Simply repeating a slogan is not an argument.\nDear Ben,\nThis is an excellent article thank you.\n“Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a masterpiece of political marketing.\nIt’s a slogan with a campaign attached, linked to some pretty heavy racial ideology and propaganda. None of it can be criticised without appearing to oppose the idea that black lives do indeed matter.\nBLM is a classic and effective piece of rhetorical blackmail. Either get on board or you’re a racist: that is the logic of it – a logic driven by fear.”\nThe question i have for us all then is what is the rhetorical language we should be using that:\n1) disarms this slogan\n2) embarrasses the liberal media to think about all those who are disadvantaged – especially the forgotten white working class – who rightly abandoned labour last year.\n3) works to increase our partys profile and recruit more members.\nPerhaps this is something we should be discussing in our branch meetings.\nI’m more optimistic than Ben and I think this is perhaps a turning point for identity politics reaching a level of mainstream exposure that will cause it to rupture and meet with a huge backlash. No-one is better at destroying the left than the left – and the more the woke left overreaches, the more extreme their demands become and the more airtime they’re given, the more ordinary people will turn strongly away from it and the more brands and companies will realise that actually they don’t want to advocate or be associated with these campaigns. It’s the “get woke, go broke” thing. The BLM hysteria in Europe is actually only a small subset of people but because brands are jumping on board and the media is giving it huge coverage, it’s being given a momentum it would never have gained otherwise. I can’t speak for America, but I certainly feel that in Europe, once BLM clearly starts going too far and the whole issue becomes toxic, there will be a shift in the corporate response to it. Similar to the way the general public attitude towards Extinction Rebellion changed after they attacked that tube (full of ordinary people on their way to work) and destroyed that lawn in Cambridge. Judging by its actions so far, BLM is bound to soon act in ways that will force brands to greatly distance themselves from it while still supporting anti-racism generally.\nI agree whole heartedly with this writer. Very cogent piece. I’ve been putting up with being “educated” about tolerance, diversity etc all my adult life and now it’s come to exactly where I thought it would because our political leaders have been so supine all along. Enough with this victim hood. Other minorities have risen to the top in society. Why have the Black community not? Perhaps it’s their fault?\nThere are plenty of black Brits who’ve risen to successful positions in their chosen fields, not to mention all the black working-class people who basically keep London running. But the stats on educational outcomes are interesting – in the UK, black African boys do well in school (as good as or better than white boys) but black Caribbean boys do badly. So there’s a big cultural difference in households between black African and black Caribbean families (relating to attitudes toward education, family stability, religion, and whether or not a father is present). This is why I think it’s unhelpful that it’s the *left* that lumps them all in together as “black”, and essentially presents all black British people as monolithic and as victims – as you say, “the black community”, when really there’s no such thing. It’s really a lot to do with black Caribbean boys growing up without male role models and without any value framework, whereas black African households normally have a strong family unit and set of values – typically churchgoing two-parent households who make sure their kids study hard, are quite strict and pay close attention to who their kids hang out with so they don’t get led astray.\nBack in 2011 the head of the Jamaican Teachers’ Association said the reason those boys do badly (both in the UK and Jamaica) is that Jamaican society is very homophobic and they deliberately under-perform to avoid being branded as gay. Of course, criticize and aspect of Afro-Caribbean culture and you’ll have BLM branding you a racist.\nwolfstar I am starting to agree with you. In my coerced silence, I find myself thinking that by being passive and silent and allowing BLM to push as far as they want, with the assistance of their friends in the media. government, police and business, they will just overreach badly.\nIn fact I think they overreached on day one but if we do as we’ve been told to do, by BLM and their supporters; surrender!\nDon’t speak unless it’s as an “ally”, and obey.\nThey will not only cause their own downfall, they will probably drag down all their cheerleaders and water carriers in the establishment. Every statue that falls, TV show that gets removed, black power salute displayed, iphone footage of lawlessness and mob beat downs?\nThousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people wake up and think, “where are the police, why is the BBC not reporting this madness but instead seems to be supporting it, why is Boris so supine and why can’t I express my opposition without being punished?”\nBLM’s radicalism, violence they way opposing them has effectively been banned and BLM’s attempt to hijack Britain and erase her history, (SUPPORTED by most of the establishment) is going to be the catalyst that might actually shake up our entire system from the BBC to policing to government. No more progressive political hegemony, no more bias and bye bye to the two main parties.\nThe field will be wide open. Hopefully the far right don’t fill that void but that’s another matter.\nIncidentally, the recent unrest being instantly branded as “far right” is yet another half truth told by the media. Of course there were plenty of ordinary people going to protect statues, a fair few football hooligans and there was a small but genuinely far right fringe, but the actual far right. I mean people like Nazi sympathiser Mark Collett and his group of ethnonationalists and national socialists called the Patriotic Alternative, they said, didn’t go. The Patriotic Alternative, Nazi fanboy consensus was that it was a trap to create bad PR and dismiss anyone to the right of Boris as a Hitler saluting meat head who brawls in the street because he hates black people.\nAnd they were correct.\nThe majority of the far right present, were more the Tommy Robinson crowd, who whilst not exactly model citizens, they do not have hatred for black people but they do have hatred for Nazis. So once again, we’ve been sold a pup by the media.\nFunny thing is, when BLM smashed things up we were admonished not to equate the largely peaceful “anti racist protest” with a tiny violent fringe but one or two possible Nazi salutes on Saturday and suddenly everyone involved is a far right extremist.\nTsk tsk this won’t end well for the media that’s for sure.\nExcellent article. Coming at the unfolding events from a slightly different angle, but very good as always, is Brendan O’Neill’s piece on it today: https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/06/10/this-has-become-a-neo-maoist-war-on-the-past/\n2 of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is Conquest and Black Lives Matter fit the role oh so perfectly\nGood article.\nAs an ageing white male I’m getting fed up with being accused of things of which I am innocent, like racism (and then being told that if I fail to acknowledge my guilt I am even guiltier because I am in denial).\nHaving young hotheads accuse me of ‘male privilege’ or ‘white privilege’ makes me bristle. It provokes the very ‘fuck-you’ feelings that these people say they are opposing. In other words, it creates the problem for which they claim to be the solution.\nI’m also fed up with seeing police officers run away from mobs of protesters; and seeing police officers stand aside as mobs demolish statues, deface public monuments, or (as in earlier Extinction Rebellion demos) take over bridges across the Thames, or dig up university lawns. I resent the fact that there appears to be one law for them and another for me.\nIt distresses me to see police officers get down on one knee when commanded to do so by a mob. It reminds me of the shame of the England football team giving the Nazi salute in Berlin in the 1930s, and it makes me realise that our police are no longer neutral enforcers of the law, but have taken sides.\nI am sickened by what’s happening to this country.\nAll lives matter. True racism barely exists in the UK today, integrate, abide by the law, be kind, that’s all that is required for total acceptance and equality. Stop making this about race, it causes hate.\nRacism hardly exists in the UK today. Stop making this about race it causes division and hate. This is political and needs to stop.\nThis rioting, protesting and looting began because George Floyd, an American criminal who was fleeing arrest, was detained by the police, who should not have used such extreme force causing him to die. He was not an innocent man,\nHowever, I remember the horrific case of Drummer Lee Rigby a young man walking on the street in broad daylight. He was hacked to death by a black savage wielding a machete. Why was there no mass protesting, riots or damage done after this ? Was it because he was a English white man perhaps? Maybe that makes it acceptable??\nI was genuinely sorry for George Floyd and his family, it was an unforgivable crime and I hope the Police men involved will face the full wait of the law.\nWhat we have seen though is this steam train at full speed of the left finding another issue, (after Brexit) to get their teeth into. We are fighting a worldwide pandemic with thousands of people dying and businesses and jobs disappearing (including mine) We are supposed to be staying close to home and doing our bit. Instead we see rioting, defacing of war memorials, statues toppled and Police officers injured. A terrible state of affairs. Great article though.\nPretty dubious arguments to me from an author of dubious background. Social Democrat is hardy a defining term these days – Neo-Con seems a more likely placing.\nChurchill was indeed a racist – a fairly casual racist because of his breeding into a family of superior beings. His amazing lack of vision on India is usually the basis for such charges. But I find his advocacy, as Colonial Secretary, of controlling Iraqi tribesmen by bombing with mustard gas left over from WWI totally racist.\nExcellent article, Ben.\nExcellent article which should be circulated widely. The BLM con is very gradually getting unmasked but most MSM will usually be the last to admit their mistakes when an organisation shows itself to be harmful rather than benign. Intersectionality linking with groups like ANTIFA give BLM added muscle on the streets, but may be their undoing as this group’s tactics become more violent, destructive but also visible.\nCurrently the Government is doing its best to ignore what’s happening but this will probably get harder to do as people’s patience wears thin and counter demonstrations become violent. Not an easy time ahead when we could all be concentrating on dealing with covid19 and getting the country back to some sort of normality.\nIn the atmosphere of this well put together piece of writing,,, I am venturing to put my thoughts to paper reluctantly as I am genuinely scared that anything I say will be put down as racist for not agreeing and support the BLM ,,, the fact of coarse is that I do support black lives matter ,,, all lives matter . let’s start at the beginning with facts ,, everyone wants to live in the western countries because viewed from the moon that would appear to be where the best living standards are , the system with all its faults was put down initially by the indigenous people who lived on these countries at the time of the industrial revolution and has been been developed further by the further generations,, communities from other countries have come to these western countries from their countries quite rightly to achieve a better life for them and their families and they have every right too ,,\nThese people are no better or worse than the original indigenous people who were originally here ,,\nThe colour of there skin really has no bearing on where they eventually find their position in these countries,,, black people have proved that they are more than capable of rising to the top an anything they choose to do ,, the ones who are achieving in 99%of situations come from well balanced homes ,, Similarly just like successful white peoples,\nThe key too better living standards for blacks and whites is a stable family home with a strong emphasis on education education education!!\nKnocking down statues will not sort the problems for black kids ,,\nMy black lady friend said to me that “ the problem lies with the black fathers who leave there wives early into their marriages deserting the family and leaving the children and wives in pain ,, these children unfortunately grow up with no moral male compass in the house ,,, have a low self asteem,,, drop out early from school and then struggle to get good jobs ,,, my friend said untill this cycle is broken nothing will change sadly. Please don’t call me a racist ,,, because I am not ,,\nI am a new member of the SDP. I joined because of what BLM is doing. By chance a day later I read this brave article. I am filled with joy that the SDP are articulating what is so wrong with B:M.\nThe centre view has been completely blind sided by this left wing counter attack. The woke brigade lost the EU referendum and then their messiah lost two elections. I thought the argument was done. On the contrary, they have regrouped and our weak cultural elite are dropping like flies in the face of BLM.\nThe Labour 2019 manifesto promised to create a committee to review British history and atone for any wrongdoing to any country or people in the world. They are now implementing this across all Labour councils. I am a mixed race British man who loves what this country stands for and am proud of its history which I very much feel is my history. I am gravely concerned for what the coming months bring given the pace of this.\nThank you thank you thank you. My thoughts & fears exactly, but more clearly expressed than I have been capable of. Again, thank you.\nGreat comment Marcus. I keep getting closer and closer to joining the SDP. Think I might have to do it.\nThanks for your interesting reply to a very insightful article. I feel there is something intrinsically counter-productive about BLM. I’m talking specifically about the organisation, not the concept of black lives mattering. I do indeed, think black lives matter. I’ve been sometimes quite vocal about this. In my mid 20s, I’d sometimes ‘correct’ people if they said something I felt they shouldn’t but this, of course, never yielded anything. People have egos and don’t like to be told they’re saying or thinking the wrong thing. BLM is doing what I used to do but on a massive scale. I now think that identity politics is horribly divisive and that this could completely backfire. BLM might stir up a lot of (sadly) dormant racist sentiment – which is not right – but it will. I’ve lived all over the country and racism is unfortunately alive and well. I wish that wasn’t the case. BLM could create a toxic situation where the far-right rise or even, far-right parties are voted in. The joke of these ‘woke’ tea companies posting support for BLM on social media is lost on most people. Has anyone read how many tea companies treat their Indian workers on tea plantations? I have white friends who are on FB, posting videos sympathetic to rioters burning down businesses in America. Some of which, have been black owned.\nAn excellent article. BLM has nothing to do with the UK; it is a very undesirable import. It is also a heaven-sent opportunity for revenge by the Left, who are still smarting over having lost the argument over Brexit; lost the referendum; lost the election; and (in many respects) lost the plot. They are milking it for all that they are worth: posturing, screaming, virtue-signalling and ranting. The media love it and are giving them air-time; careerist senior police officers are caving in. Slavery still exists in the modern world, but you will not hear a word about that, as most of the slave owners are Muslim and it is dangerous to criticise Muslims. Christians are being persecuted and slaughtered in a range of countries, including Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq…. in fact, Christianity is the most-persecuted faith in the world. Not a peep out of the UK human rights industry, the media or – disgracefully – any politicians. And how far back exactly does the process of ‘reparation’ end? The Normans committed atrocities when they conquered England. So did the Romans. Should we now be engaging with France and Italy about these? The process could be endless.\nMakes complete sense to me. I saw an a trailer for the Discovery channel last night which displayed the words Black lives matter. This organisation accused us whites of racism but they are the racists\nThe police top brass aren’t caving.\nEverything they do from Pride March to diversity quotas to arresting people for Tweets to recording “non crime hate incidents”, all are part of the same ultra progressive, social justice cloth BLM are cut from. Indeed police top brass like Cressida Dick, tend to have been diversity hires or chosen for their commitment to progressive values, rather than their extensive experience on the beat.\nBLM and the modern British police force share a sort of social and political kinship. This is why so much of the establishment supports BLM unconditionally. Of course the MET don’t want to abolish capitalism, and… themselves, but they do see racism everywhere and routing it out is their fervent calling.\nI was challenged by someone yesterday to name a British establishment that wasn’t progressive.\nI couldn’t.\nEven the police and church are deeply progressive.\nSo in a funny was BLM aren’t the revolution storming the barricades.\nThey are the progressive revolutionary guard trying to protect the revolution from a counter revolution in the form of Brexit and the desire of many to reverse the liberal revolution Blair ushered in.\nIt’s Blair’s revolution which gave us an incredibly progressive police force…cough…service, & a progressive clergy.\nSo I think of the BLM thugs who attacked police and defaced Churchill as more like the immune system of a successful revolution which is losing it’s grip via the ballot box.\nWhen you have a successful, bloodless revolution in a democracy, there’s no guarantees the electorate won’t vote to reverse it and when they do, violent, radical responses will naturally manifest in the parts of society which benefited most from the revolution, and fear a counter revolution most.\nNo conspiracy needed.\nMany minorities saw Brexit and Boris as the progress they made being reversed, ditto for the left. If it hadn’t been BLM flipping on the back of George Floyd’s tragic death, it would’ve been something else.\nI kind of see the mobbing of Cummings as a precursor to this. It had a touch of the Medieval mob about it, and, hey presto, a few weeks later there are scenes in Bristol reminiscent of Baghdad!\nThe minority and left coalition are the beneficiaries of the revolution and the revolutionary guard, backed up by an establishment which bares no resemblance to the traditional British establishment. The idea that the British establishment is some fuddy duddy, conservative bastion hasn’t been true for decades.\nThis establishment is the baby of the Cool Britannia revolution.\nThe Archbishop and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner would be more at home at Glastonbury grooving to some African tunes and wearing a rainbow for Pride, than teaching about traditional, conservative Christianity or getting tough on gang culture in the inner cities.\nThis establishment fears more than anything, an electorate that actually wouldn’t mind a bit of good old traditional religion and tough law and order.\nThat goes against everything this Blairite revolutionary establishment stands for.\nTherefore, BLM are like knights in shining armour, coming over the horizon to beat back the hordes of backwards, racist gammon/orks at Helms Deep. The establishment see allies, in BLM. Taking the knee and policing softly isn’t them caving, it’s them greeting liberators with flowers.\nBrilliant and true, well done Ben.\nThe problem with this article is the title – particularly the word “respond” – which instanty sets up conflict and panders to right wing beliefs. If instead the title (and emphasis of the piece) had been “Black Lives Matter – How Can We Help?”, then the opportunity might have been there to show that “all lives matter” in a way that would be healing. This article is devisive, and, worse than that, seems knowingly to wish to stir up bad feeling while appearing to be innocent..\n“respond” is completely neutral and free of any preconception or value judgement – it’s just like asking how we should respond to any kind of protest movement. If the headline had used the verb “combat” your argument would stand. “how do we combat” and “how do we help” are both ideological starting points (one negative, one positive), so “respond” is the best choice as it’s completely open. It’s like you think the only option is to agree with the movement. There are tons and tons of people of all ethnicities (including lots of black people) who absolutely think black lives matter (of course they do!) and who are committed to combating discrimination wherever they encounter it, but who disagree with the goals and methods of Black Lives Matter the political campaigning organization.\nGreat analysis of a complex situation – how do I join the SDP – sounds like your policies may actually represent the real feelings and views of the “ silent majority “\nhttps://membermojo.co.uk/sdp\nA well needed dose of sanity during insane times.\nBlackmail politics indeed. They keep using terms like ‘whataboutism’ and the such in an attempt to completely undermine a relevant response to some of this nonsense.\nCalling people ‘racist’ or ‘fascist’ seems to be the favourite choice.\nLet’s not be cowards in the face of this..\nVery interesting and soundly reasoned.\nI am in my 60’s …have worked hard all my life, pay my taxes, abide by the law, treat everyone regardless of race, colour or religion with respect. I have never before witnessed so much hostility in this Country ! A guy was murdered in USA by a cop ! all of sudden the world goes out of control whilst going through Pandemic ! The press seem intent on destroying the Ruling Party and undermining the science … what can some one like myself do ? I feel like a lone impotent voice. My friends, colleagues and family feel as I do, but how do we have our say ? I have written and emailed the Government and scientists with support. I have emailed the relevant news agency with my concerns regarding the negative demoralising impact of the journalists …..what else can some one like myself do ? I am to old to go protesting against the protesters, I am not fit enough to protect my history and heritage physically ….HELP! Point me in the direction of freedom and liberty , that’s what I thought I was doing every time I hit the voting booth .\nWhat a load of privileged bullshit this article is. Absolutely fucking biased.\nWhat’s your argument?\nI find this BLM movement extremely worrying, the way that they have been behaving, and the way the establishment seem powerless or even reluctant to take action and enforce the rule of law, brings to mind the way that the Brown Shirts behaved in the 1930’s bringing Hitler to power and the silence of the majority of the German people when atrocities were then perpetrated in their name.\nI understand your frustration Jan. I’m a relatively young and fit man but I have been forced to keep silent and know if I were in the UK and were to do anything to protect our history and heritage from this lunacy, I would just be dismissed as far right by the journalists.\nUnfortunately, the progressive capture of all our institutions kind of has us all in checkmate.\nIf you say anything, you’re a racist, if you do anything you’re a far right thug.\nThey can get us fired, smear us, silence us and beat us and there’s nothing we can do because the whole machine and the moral judgment of the chattering classes will squash us if we try.\nThe only thing to do is actually allow BLM to push it as far as they possibly can.\nPull down as many statues as they want, until even the progressive media has to say ENOUGH and the police can no longer go softly on one side and hard on the other.\nOnce the media does that, and the police cease to be supine for BLM, then the danger of losing everything for dissenting will disappear and the silent majority will be able to speak again.\nBut unfortunately, until then we must take the Gandhi approach and be totally passive. We’ve seen what confronting them looks like and it looks like a bunch of drunk football hooligans fighting minorities, with violence all round.\nNO.\nThe only answer to BLM is to silently wait. Let them push it so far that even the establishment cannot continue to support them. Then and only then can we rid ourselves of this extremist group and start putting back together what they pull down.\nAnd boy oh boy will the establishment have lost a lot of it’s credibility. I think, if we can avoid conflict with BLM and let them push it to the limit, it really could be the end of the progressive status quo in the political and media class.\nFor now, we’re all in political, social, moral and physical checkmate and must be passive. BLM have the talking stick and will do for a while yet.\nKeep strong and vote SDP in defiance. Let’s get change like that.\nWell written article and certainly brings clarity to the recent tensions we are seeing unfold. Can the activists working to agitate racial tensions not be brought to justice for inciting racism?\nBLM is an intolerant illiberal politicised movement that has reduced an incredibly complex argument to populist sound bites. They are patronising and, dare I say it, racist in their belief that all black people agree with their narrative and indeed want them to speak on their behalf.\nAll lives matter and basic human rights should be for all.\nMainstream media is running scared of rigorous thoughtful debate just as they did on extreme Islam.\nWhoa! I didn’t even know the SDP was still around, much less that its members, or one of them, was so sensible.\nComing hard on the heels of the BLM demos is now the craziness of destroying all statues that they find repugnant. This is yet again an attack not only on cultural identity but also an erosion of freedom of expression. Why should these non accountable individuals be allowed to get away with cultural vandalism?\nGood read.\nThere is a lack of moral courage, that’s for sure. I’m pretty sure I’d be sacked in an instant for my beliefs, which are ultimately driven by a fear that BLM harm black people, as well as communities.\nWe all know the crime stats – 90% of black murder victims are from black offenders and black people murder at 6 times the rate of white people etc. So, it simply seems at the outset that BLM is more about attacking white people that protecting black lives, as evidently focusses the attention on white people and police, rather than the causes of the great majority of black murder victims.\nBut also, telling black people that those problem is in the hearts of all the white people around them can’t do much but fuel both anger and an abdication of responsibility. To commit any crime, if you are not a psychopath, requires some degree of self-justification. So, I can’t help but feel that the US rioting occurred when black people, in the main, no longer felt any responsibility to have empathy. which was the point that that they believed no morality had been shown towards them. The fact that Asians top the US earning rate, not whites, and there are rafts of genuine dedicated pathways for black youngsters to progress, suggests the US is not an intrinsically racist nation in the regard it holds back non-white people. So, the BLM’s narrative is divisive, false and inciteful.\nAll this becomes part of fuelling a cycle, I feel: suspicion, resentment, hopelessness, poorer life outcomes, anger, violence, the poorer opinions of others, and the accusations others have racist beliefs: which helps the cycle to start over. On top of this, it clashes with the cycle of other poorer groups – take white nationalists for instance – and leads to a dynamic we now know as competitive victimhood. The two or more cycles feed from each other then.\nIn the UK, the dynamic is a little different as the black outcomes are not so stark, but we do now have white boys at the bottom of the educational attainment class. Again, it hardly speaks of a racist nation that holds back non whites as Asians and Chinese top the entrance rates for university.\nIm not sure how you quantify “privilege”, other than to note people are born into situations where they inherit greater or lesser opportunity, given family structure and wealth. I’m not sure where being black comes into it thereafter as meriting further disadvantage, particularly given that there is then 18 years of free education to level the playing field. In the UK, 1 in 4 suffer poor mental health each year. Meanwhile, at some point in life, we will suffer disease and lose loved ones. We will be the victims of crime et al – and generally suffer forms of trauma that might render us incapacitated for a time. The idea that reparation be given because 300-400 years ago, people with your skin colour, that you never knew or met, had desperately bad lives at the hands of a handful of noblemen with white skins, represent a particular form of disadvantage over those very other very tangible and traumatic issues people face in life is an argument i’ve never seen. However, very rightly, that’s the one that Labour and BLM et al are inherently making and it going unquestioned.\nUltimately, though, i do fear that poor black children will suffer the most from BLM, as the BLM’s message to them is – at its core – one that they are held back intentionally by those around them because of their skin colour and that are pre-determined to fail without special assistance not present in the world today: that is surely a terrible mindset to give a child, or indeed anyone, particularly when its not true.\nCan we not pass a law (quickly) to invalidate and disempower the racism card. So that any british person, regardless of colour cannot claim racism as white british already cant. Can we also gag newspapers on tbe reporting of anything to do with racism/protests and not give them the platform they require. Are we SO WEAK, that government cant do anything that tbe public pay them for..it is OUR money, afterall and we demand a government with backbone.Dont matter what the rest of the world thinks. We demand action. And NOW!!\nDebra,\nYou are right to suggest that a lot of newspaper reporting does nothing to help the current situation, often making it worse. Resorting to censorship however is not to way to win.\nRather, the counter-argument needs to be given a strong a strong voice. We need politicians who are unafraid to speak truth, to challenge the current orthodoxy.\nAmazing comment\nNot censorship but prosecution under race relations law. If Nick Griffin can be prosecuted for talking about grooming gangs recklessly, then the media organisations and activist journalists can and should be prosecuted for recklessly implying white racism is an omnipresent deadly force. right here, right now, and BAME violence and racism a non-issue.\nIt’s a sophisticated form of Radio Rwanda, in Britain 2020. It’s leading to racial Balkanisation and MUST stop before the wheels come off.\nMy dad (a life long moderate centrist), is convinced black people are being oppressed RIGHT NOW and we really must allow BLM the space to force change and tear down statues if needs be.\nBecause he believes this, he also believes dissent is akin to being a dissenter during the civil rights movement in the 60s. Not that it should be banned but that it’s clearly immoral and on the wrong side of history and invites negative consequences. He’s not saying to me he believes my dissent should be punished, just that it will be as the arc of justice progresses.\nTherefore, for those of us who disagree, it’s up to us to stop listening to dangerous, unreliable or biased right wing sources, look at what the trusted sources say and adjust our position to what is clearly the correct position.\nI tried to show him articles and podcasts involving liberals, black liberals and academics from across the political spectrum, using data to show the racism panic is exactly that, a moral panic. At best something we should be circumspect about and at worst a total myth.\nYet he doesn’t accept a youtube link, a conservative outlet, podcasts and voices not recognised in establishment circles.\nHe is of a vintage that trusts the BBC implicitly and he personally considers the Economist the benchmark of balanced written journalism. If the BBC and the Economist shun opposing views or argue against them, then no amount of data will penetrate. It has to come from a “trusted” source.\nSo if not legal sanctions against mainstream media, how do we get them to stop being biased activists?\nIt’s deadly.\nA large amount of the BLM people are Marxists which in itself demonstrates they don’t read Marx. He was a terrible person he hates Jews and blacks (called them n——), to demonstrate here is a quote;\n“Without slavery, North America, the most progressive nation, would he transformed into a patriarchal country. Only wipe North America off the map and you will get anarchy, the complete decay of trade and modern civilisation. But to do away with slavery would be to wipe America off the map.”\nKarl Marx\nWe DO NOT want Marxism operating in the UK power structure Karl Marx was as bad as Hitler and communism is WORSE than the Nazis.\nPeople protesting is fine, let them, if anyone is caught vandalising, burning or fighting then they need to be arrested and held to justice (real justice not any of that ‘social justice’ nonsense.\nBrilliant article.\nVery well written Sir.\nI’m a Conservative Party member and will be displaying this article if that’s ok?\nI am most certainly not a racist but feel there’s a wedge being forced between us which will not make matters better.\nWhat are we really supposed to do to heal this?\nRegards\nVery well written Sir,\nI am a Conservative Party member and, with your permission, like to copy this article.\nI am most definitely not a racist and feel this is driving a wedge between us and is only going to make matters worse.\nWhat can we do to prevent this happening?\nRegards\nPerfect summation\nWhat a refreshing article. Thank you for being brave enough to write it in these hysterical times\nNo-one in their right minds could disagree with any of what you say.\nIt would seem that making amends will take many years of getting the facts through to the up and coming generations.\nBut it’s clear that many teachers today do not support good sense: nor do they wish to persevere and put in double the energy and will power to make the difference.\nSo where do we go from here?\nSCO\nI find this BLM movement extremely frightening, this reminds me very much of how the Brown Shirts behaved in Germany in the 1930’s and brought Hitler to power and all of the atrocities that followed thereafter.\nThankyou for your excellent article, it fills out some of the gaps in my knowledge and reafirms my suspicions about BLM..I believe in freedom and democracy BLM is neither.\nExcellent article thankyou,reafirms my suspicions and gives me more knowledge..education is the key.\nBrilliantly written piece which gets to the crux of the matter. Sadly the main stream media will not touch this very balanced view.\nWho do we vote next election?\nWho do we vote next election? Iv no faith in boris anymore he’s allowing this to happen\nAn excellent article, alas not one the BBC will air.\nNow Premiership Football has swallowed the whole nonsense and will be virtue signalling with gusto – we were making progress with diversity but now this insistence that white British history must be erased will lead to trouble. These naive young people don’t seem to realise that they are very much a minority in this country. I hope the Gov has more grit than the kneeling Labour politicians.\nBLM says nothing about black on black homicide (7000 per year in the USA) but seizes opportunistically on one minor black ex criminal killed by a white cop (9 unarmed black men killed by cops last year in USA). They wish to defund the police, which will expose black neighbourhoods to even more violence. They are left wing anarchists.\nI am in total agreement with this statement.\nParticularly sad that if you question any of the BLM activities you are immediately branded a racist.\nAll very frustrating and unsettling.\nI’m very concerned about where all this is heading and the future of our country\nThis article needs to go mainstream. The ordinary people and the big corporations who are blindly contributing and bowing to this movement should stop, take a breath and actually bother to research what the intentions of this group are. it’s an extremely dangerous ideology and we are seeing in the US, these lawless “free zones” and the defunding of police. The British press are hardly talking about it. The trend of the statue pulling started in Bristol and followed to the US and elsewhere. The “autonomous zones” have started in the US and that trend is likely to follow in other countries too.\nDefund the BBC\nAs I just said to Ben on Twitter. I’ve never had death threats before or been ostracised by family or friends, despite having some pretty robust and contrarian online debates. I’ve been a proudly opinionated outspoken person online since before 2005.\nI’ve expressed controversial opinions about everything from Islam and mass immigration to, Brexit and my dislike of Labour. Despite coming from London and almost everyone I know being an insufferable Labour stalwart, I’ve never had a problem beyond a robust discussion or perhaps a few barbs.\nA few years ago I even had a long thread on Facebook discussing the truth about crime statistics and race and how they clearly showed, black people weren’t being shot because they were black and they most certainly, were not being hunted.\nEven that passed by without a hitch.\nI was still able to meet and drink with black friends and navigate the social world without rancour. I had absolutely zero fear that I might find myself ostracised or someone might physically attack me for my views.\nBut since I started posting about my opposition to BLM’s anti capitalism, quite frankly racist views, shoddy evidence, violent, totalitarian tendencies, and opposing the vandalism of statues, there has been a mob like reaction.\nSure my comments were contrarian but clearly not racist or hateful and I took pains to say George Floyd was clearly murdered and the police involved should face the music.\nNevertheless I have been incredibly uneasy since.\nI have been bombarded by black friends writing litanies of the racism they’ve experienced demanding I apologise. Almost demanding I show guilt and contrition as if I had been the racist! They were using their anecdotes as a way to shame and guilt me into not only agreeing with them, but surrendering.\nI’ve had Indian friends saying Britain is one of the most vile countries ever and I should be ashamed to oppose the vandalism of the statues. I’ve had old old school friends call me a Tommy Robinson bile spewing right winger and others tell me I’m a disgrace to my family.\nI’m pretty sure I have lost five friends I’ve known since school and five extended family members. The kind of situation where I will never see those friends ever ever again and the extended family would probably refuse to be in the same room with me.\nI live in Thailand and my dad is nursing my step mum who is dying of cancer, yet he took the time to make a worried phone call to me out here in Thailand, to beg me not to say more as he fears people may try to find me & get me fired or worse.\nI’m quite frankly shell shocked. After all these years robustly debating ideas and breaking taboos, I make a couple of carefully, considered, backed up critiques of BLM and suddenly I’m in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. They’ve all become a hardliner BLM hive mind and I’m a contagion which must be neutralized without prejudice!\nIt’s like overnight the entirety of Britain became a one party state and I had said unforgivable counter revolutionary things.\nAre we not seeing the rise of a totalitarian movement akin to The Cultural Revolution?\nIt’s a mass psychological phenomenon. It has a lot to do with class, a kind of conspicuous do-gooding – being seen to care as a form of currency. I’m more optimistic than Ben because I think the more it goes mainstream and is exposed to broad daylight, the more it will burn out. These things hijack people’s desire to be Good People, but go down any suburban street in middle England outside the M25 and most people don’t care. It will actually push mainstream politics further right at the ballot box.\nI think I have just found what I was looking for. Excellent and brave article and thanks to google brought my attention back to the SDP. Black lives do matter and you may have just won my vote.\nThank you for replying. Yes it’s certainly a kind of mass psychosis. Many of the people who have told me not to say what I’m saying, (including my dad) are the most moderate, liberal people I know, yet they don’t seem to be too perturbed by the idea that disagreement is verboten.\nNot racism, hatred or incitement to violence, but a decent and fair political challenge.\nBanned!\nPunishable by social, financial and perhaps even physical consequences.\nThis hasn’t phased the kind of soft woolly, Archers listening middle class moderates in the slightest. The disagreement with BLM perturbs them more than the demand with menaces to shut up.\nFor the softest most liberal part of society to so blithely acquiesce to such an extreme position. The position of political absolutism backed by force; and not just to acquiesce but to even contribute to it! Astonishing.\nIt will be something written about and thought about for decades to come.\nI think the reason why the most woolly and moderate people in our society seem to have become willing to reinforce totalitarian demands, is because of what you mention. Class but I might add religion or lack thereof.\nThe class you speak of. The woolly middle classes, mostly lost their religion but replaced it of the religion of “decency”. Decency above all else is the religion of the woolly middle classes.\nBoth my parents are of that class and raised me ALWAYS to think of other people’s feelings. Don’t be offensive, be decent.\nBeing a racist in modern Britain is probably the worst, most indecent thing you could be and as Ben point’s out, the genius of the phrase “Black Lives Matter”, is to put you in the impossible situation where to disagree immediately makes one seem racist.\n“So you don’t think black lives matter?”\nSo BLM is kind of parasitic on the woolly middle class religion of decency.\nIf decency is the highest good, racism the most indecent thing in the world and disagreeing with BLM racist by default?\nIt goes without saying, those who value kindness, decency and caring about “the other” the most, would find themselves unwittingly becoming extremely intolerant and authoritarian.\nBLM has managed to hijack millions of harmless middle class men and women who would usually never dream of getting behind a movement which threatens those who dissent, let alone join that movement in demanding people stop dissenting themselves.\nDo-gooders who never hurt a fly, hold every single liberal value under the sun and make homemade marmalade whilst listening to Radio 4, are now blithely endorsing the menacing totalitarian ultimatum of…\nYOU CAN’T SAY THAT AND IF YOU DO, YOU’LL BE SORRY\nWhen if such an ultimatum were to come from anyone to the right of Amber Rudd, they would be thinking about the rise of fascism and ringing the alarm rather than nodding in agreement.\nBLM hijacks liberalism and decency and turns even woolly people into their foot soldiers.\nInteresting but worrying times.\nSpot on! Yes, society would be a better place if it were devoid of overt or subtle racism, but this action will only inflame division. I wouldn’t ‘take the knee’ for many reasons: the first, as you say, is that it’s blackmail; the second, that the black and brown people I know well are accomplished and successful and I suspect they would consider it patronising; the third, that I’m just fed up with being blamed for everything. I’m a white, grey-haired male pensioner so I must be a racist, misogynist, homophobic git robbing the younger generation, right? No. I have treated people with generosity, respect and courtesy my whole life and I don’t deserve this stereotyping.\nFull disclosure, I was sent here via a comment on a BLM post.\nI read the article with interest – good to break out of echo chambers – but struggled to find much that was persuasive.\nThe claims of favouritism in immediate media representation seems to skip over the more important question of whether structural racism is an issue that merits attention. It is not new that people saying things worthy of attention get airtime, so without this consideration it’s just conjecture whether these interviews are “favouritism”, or simply news.\nAnd by focusing on the very small number of activists you claim are disproportionately gaining organisational dominance (with no sources), you ignore the much larger question of what is happening to everyone else. I don’t know if this is tactics or ignorance, but if you look at stats on things like employment outcomes and deaths in police custody I can see why you might not make that the focus, or offer any sources with such data, given the rest of the article.\nFinally – cultural, voluntary “totalitarianism” is not totalitarianism, it’s just successful political messaging. The kind you are advocating for SDP doing more of. Except BLM’s is working.\nStart shouting from the rooftops\n‼️ LIVES MATTER ‼️\nWHO COULD PROTEST AGAINST THAT ⁉️\nwe are all on this world together.. If we work together we will survive and if we don’t its just a matter of time before we ALL perish.\nFingers crossed for our future ? ?❤️\nNoel, that’s the thing, the media is clearly biased and criminally so.\nThere are very strong data driven arguments against concepts such as structural racism, that our terrestrial media just ignores. You have to go to podcasts like Glenn Loury’s or Sam Harris’s to find out the mountain of evidence that exists to the contrary, and most people don’t have time for a 2 hour podcast or are of a vintage where the idea of consuming your media through the computer, rather than goggle box just isn’t going to catch on. So for a great many people, the facts, or at least many facts, are just unknown.\nFor instance, Harvard economist Dr Roland Fryer (a black academic) surveyed an entire state police force expecting to find white cops were more likely to shoot black men, but found the opposite. Black and Latino officers were far more likely to do so than their white counterparts, who were quite rationally afraid to be that next viral video of the racist cop. A situation which would ruin their life, so most white officers are actually quite keen to avoid shooting black men.\nThere were 7,407 black homicide victims in the US in 2018, assuming a comparable number in 2019, the nine unarmed men killed by police would represent just 0.1 percent of black homicides and many, if not most were justified shootings. Hardly an epidemic of racist killer cops worthy of a worldwide revolution in the name of BLM.\nBy contrast cops are 18% more likely to die at the hands of a black man than visa versa.\nWhile black Americans are involved in two times more police shootings than their percentage of the population, they commit 53 percent of murders and 60 percent of robberies well over four times their percentage of the population, which is 13%\nAs for non cop related, straight up racist attacks. Perhaps that’s where the rump of white racism is?\nIn fact whites are the overwhelming victims of interracial violence.\nBetween 2012 and 2015, blacks committed 85.5 percent of all black-white interracial violent interactions. That works out to 540,360 assaults on whites. Whites committed 14.4 percent of all interracial violent victimization, or 91,470 assaults on blacks. Blacks are 13 percent of the national population…\nNow this is not to say, there’s no problem at all. The sheer amount of crime in black areas is bound to effect the perception of black people in the eyes of certain hardened cops. Roland Fryer’s research found that young black men were far more likely to be handled roughly by cops. Less likely to be shot but more likely to be disrespected, pushed, shoved and manhandled, so there’s certainly a conversation to be had but it would involve ALL of that other contrary evidence I lay out above. Evidence that would most certainly invalidate racial uprisings from London to Los Angeles.\nThe BBC and pretty much all other mainstream media outlets are completely uninterested in having that conversation. They want to stay on message.\nAmerica is racist, black people are oppressed and black men are being hunted in the streets.\nThis is bias.\nIt’s a dereliction of duty, and as racial violence begins to spill out onto our streets, and I cannot criticise BLM smashing up London without death threats, I believe that bias displayed by organisations such as the BBC, is potentially criminal.\nWe charged Nick Griffin for inciting racial violence for talking about Muslim grooming gangs in 2004. Yet in hindsight it turns out that he was correct but he was charged partly because he was reckless.\nThe BBC’s bias in talking about the plight of black people in countries like America is reckless and it’s refusal to give equal airtime to contrary data, has almost certainly played a role in the racial unrest we are seeing on London’s streets now. They should be treated like Nick Griffin and hopefully they will learn that they MUST do their jobs properly.\nNo more media bias. It is causing things to fall apart.\nConsider Floyd’s victims. Please look at how all this looks from their space. Floyd has convictions from 2007.\nThey only cared about Floyd for a week,if that?\nThis was all planned ages ago!\nReading this article and comments section brings me some relief to know that I’m not barking mad for not falling in line and for being quite worried at where this level of desperate conformity will lead to. I have renewed my SDP membership; these articles and discussions are vital so thanks to everyone involved – keep it up and do your best not to fear the ‘far right’ umbrella smear label.\nFew of the commenters here understand what’s going on. The crowds of mostly young and mostly white people are not supporters of BLM as such. The slogan has been adopted because it carries a message. And you all need to think hard about why these folks are out there marching. They are marching because they instinctively sense that there are things that society needs to fix, has needed to fix for a long time, and the Floyd murder was the spark that finally set off the mass protests. Making this all about the BLM movement is simply a convenient excuse to push back.\nMuch informed talk in the US on what this is all about. I’d suggest George Webb (YT), but many others who have dug deep into the funding sources and deeper alliances. The UK is really just riding on the coat-tails of the US here.\nOne doc which has been referred to over there is their own armed force’s pocket book on irregular warfare, insurgency and counter-insurgency. It’s publicly available at:\nhttps://www.soc.mil/ARIS/books/pdf/Unconventional%20Warfare%20Pocket%20Guide_v1%200_Final_6%20April%202016.pdf\nalthough you may find things like ‘server unavailable’ unless you use a VPN to access via a US IP address..\nWell from my observation they are saying black lives matter, but then went out in their thousands to infect each other knowing the deadly coronavirus discriminates and attacks BAME groups more so than others. Then they went home to their families to infected them.. errrr kind of baffled in their plight and logic that black lives matter. Obviously not by their selfish, uneducated stupidity as they have probably infected themselves, the others around them and their families, some of which may even die.\nThe correct definition of racism is to believe one’s race is superior to ALL others; in current society the term has been hijacked to use as a weapon against anyone who doesn’t allow someone to do whatever they want, whenever they want and used as a get out of jail card free whenever needed.\nI have news for you all, doesn’t matter what colour you identify as, in the 21st century a nasty nob head is a nasty nob head full stop, and you will be treated as such. Get over yourself and look at the bigger picture of suffering going on with children, disabled, vulnerable, elderly etc etc etc.\nAnd lastly something for everyone to look up is that BLM happily self-identifies as a neo-Marxist movement with various far left objectives.\nI’m here on this website as I’m desperately trying to find an opposition to BLM; to find others who see them for what they are; Marxist terrorists intent on destroying our shared values And way of life.\nIn all of my life, I have never seen such support or polarisation for an organisation which is blatantly racist.\nThank you for publishing this article. I can only hope that all other mainstream political parties also join this sentiment before it is too late.\nYes, I agree. I am an Asian who have worked in predominantly black people environment in U K. Let me tell tell you honestly, that I have experienced lot of prejudice and discrimination working with mainly black African people in England. They get together and speak in their language in work environment and all were very hostile to mainly Asian people. They hate Asian people and make nasty comments. Who said black people are NOT racist, they are and I can give many examples. I have worked with them now for 15 years and know them very well. Black African people have money, they are not poor and discriminated as the media makes out, certainly not in UK, many own more than few houses and know how to obtain council houses etc.\nI fear that if BLM takes hold in U K, it will be very bad for the country, British people are generally very tolerant.What has happened to British Media? What has happened to British Police?\nSomething does not feel right, when people are being sacked for Speaking truth. Nigel Farage was sacked from LBC radio for being honest and speaking the truth.\nPlease explain what is happening.\nRace is a construct. In reality, all human beings are much the same, and therefore it is daft to treat people differently on the basis of which “race” they can be attached to. However, we do have to recognise that some people do, and have throughout history. We do have serious issues here when it comes to understanding our history.\nFor example, I learnt about the Slave Trade at school, under the impression it was the product of opportunistic sea captains looking for a return cargo. The reality is it was little less than Government policy at the time, conducted by the Royal African Company (the clue is in the name) under a Royal Charter granting a monopoly to that company. Prince James, Duke of York and later James II, was one of the main investors. What could appear more respectable to society at the time than a company of such standing? Edward Colston was not some dodgy dealer, but a man participating in a national endeavour authorised at the highest level. In today’s terms, he’d be a senior executive in a private company servicing a government franchise.\nThat doesn’t diminish the terrible things his company did, but it does show the guilt was not his alone but the nation’s as a whole, and I think it is time we understood that. It illustrates how history is not a story of heroes and villains, but of real people living through times of conflict and sometimes doing terrible things. There are few if any great British leaders who have not made questionable decisions or participated in dodgy national projects, but that is likely to be true of every other nation as well. Human beings have to live in the real world. Politics is the art of the possible.\nThat’s not to say Identity Politics is not dangerous and destabilising – of course it is. Building a fairer society can’t be done by singling certain groups out for special treatment – only by promoting the ideal of fairness for all. The moment you identify a group as underdogs and give them privileges in an attempt to compensate them they cease to be the underdog and become privileged. The moment you discount members of a certain group as “privileged” they become a despised underdog no one listens to. Fairness has not been achieved. The injustice has just been reversed.\nConflict does not build peace, and privilege does not build equality, however well meant. The only way forward is to concentrate on fairness or justice for all as the goal and produce policies to protect that.\nAs for protecting people from aggressive persecution on the basis of some real or perceived identity, the way to do that is not to outlaw criticism or negative opinions, but to outlaw intimidation, bullying, slander and other negative tactics. Politicians will not do that, because that is precisely what they like to do themselves. Stirring up trouble and narrowing issues to knee-jerk responses is such an easy way to generate a loyal tribal following, and votes based on that are so much easier to obtain than ones based on sound reason about ideas.\nI think that Protester’s should have been told that any protests would be banned during the pandemic after all they were breaking the law and were supposed to be 2 metres apart and not spreading it and that anyone destroying property and buildings would feel the full force of the law and then give some stiff sentencing. It started in another Country – WE DID NOT choke George Floyd here and most decent human beings have understood their outrage. The War Veteran protecting our monuments and the Black Lady having a discussion did say that they would not sort things by violence and actually in some quarters it is doing more harm than good. There were lots of things in our History that were wrong like most other Countries but you cannot erase it only try and make things better and I believe that this Country has done quite a bit in that respect. Poor Boris I have to feel sorry for him what with Brexit, Pandemic, himself on death’s door and now this!\nThis really articlulates many of the most important and concerning issue with this movement. Data and statistics frequently do not support claims they have made, or have been misconstrued in order for them to support the required narrative, however as the articles outline individuals, corporations, media and government are either unable or unwilling to challenge. The consequences of allowing this to go unchecked could be profoundly damaging to society.\nIf you would like to hear (or read) the facts and evidence: go to the Hoover institute and their interviews with Thomas Sowell – the black american economist – a wonderful, lucid and empirical economist.\nHe refutes all the left-liberal nonsense and the damage that their programmes and the welfare state have done to the black (and other) communities in the US (and as set out by Theordore Dalymple in his book Life at the Bottom: the world view that makes the underclass).\nHe looks at the facts going over the 20th century and highlights things like the changes and trends in family and community life, and economic progress up to the 1960s and the subsequent decades. The facts are the complete opposite of what people in general know/believe.\nHe is now 90yrs old but if you listen to the interviews just two years ago he is sharp and clear as ever. The current state of affairs is not just a matter of saying the liberal-left are mistaken they are culpable as they have pursued five decades presiding over social degeneration/pathology caused or enabled by their programmes.\nHis recent tweet 3 Jun 2020: ” Racism is not dead, it is on life support, kept alive mainly by people who use if for an excuse or to keep the minority communities fearful or resentful enough to turn out as a voting bloc on election day”.\nHis books are many:-\nIntellectuals and Race\nIntellectuals and Society\nWealth Poverty and Politics\nDiscrimination and Disparities\nEconomic Facts and Fallacies\nThe Myths of Economic Inequality\nBasic Economics\nBasic Economics\netc\nI checked out what the BLM organisation and the three founders stand for – see below. I think everyone should write to their MP and ask them if this is what they support.\nIf they don’t formally disassociate themselves then they need to be called out.\nBased on research on the internet the following can be found either on BLM’s website or the background activities/statements/associations of the three founders and others.\nThey all seem to be valid.\nBLM and associates:\n– want to ‘defund the police’\n– want to ‘dismantle the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work “double shifts” so that they can mother in private even as they participate in public justice work’\n– want to ‘disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” ‘\n– support revolutionary Marxist ideology.\n– want to abolish capitalism\n– have supported and lauded the fugitive Assata Shakur*\n– support black queer and trans folks because they: “bear a unique burden in a hetero-patriarchal society that disposes of us like garbage and simultaneously fetishizes us and profits off of us”\n– have associations with the socialist and Marxist-Leninist group, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization\n– see Palestine as a victim and are against Israel whose detention of Palestinians is like the incarceration of blacks in the United States\n– appear to have had links with the US terrorist group, Weather Underground Organization, which bombed a building in Greenwich, NY, the U.S. Capitol building, The U.S. State Department building and the Pentagon during the late 1960’s and early 1970’s.\n– seek regime change and the end of the rule of law\n* Shakur is a Marxist revolutionary, a member of the Black Liberation Army, and a former Black Panther. In 1972, Shakur and an associate shot and killed a New Jersey State Trooper and injured another. In 1977, Shakur was convicted of seven felonies, including the murder of the State Trooper. In 1979, Shakur escaped prison and fled to Cuba in 1984, where she sought political asylum. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called for her extradition earlier in 2016.\nAgree with your comments entirely but the media have fallen for mixing equality up with the aims of the BLM which if their manifesto is implemented It’ll not only take ones FREEDOM but destroy the essence of our way of life completely, it foul ,it’ll imprison individuals and one will become SERVANTS to the BNP hierarchy\ni came on here as i wanted to see what other peoples views are as i am well aware that given my internet search history i will always get directed to sites supporting my political views. I am a black lives matter supporting left leaning liberal that you are all very opposed to. I expected to come on here and see a load of racist , uneducated red necks which is of course is reflecting a bias in me that is pretty shameful. What I have been surprised to see is that we all have the same fears and acknowledgments about the causes of some of the hideous things we are seeing in society today. I too hate the bbc and other media outlets who frame messages in certain ways and are generally biased towards the political ideology that represents their views. I too am concerned that we are no longer living in a trully democratic world given that there is so much scope for thr media to sway peoples voting behaviour and views. I too believe that there is a clear disparity in opportunities between the working class and ruling class right down to education, health, employment legal representation and that in order to get to the same level of these people you need to work three times as hard. I do believe that all lives matter and me saying black lives matter is not saying that i disagree with this line of thinking that all lives matter. I dont believe people saying all lives matter is racist I just believe that black lives matter too and this is often not the case. I fear that we are living in a divided society and people are becoming more extreme in their views and i worry that this could lead to more violence and targetting of particular groups of people. I also worry like yourselves that we will end up like nazi germany and no longer able to express our views without being shunned or worse killed. I believe in freedom of expression but I do not believe that we should allow for expressions that incite hatred and division and violence. I have come to the conclusion that although we share different political views we all have the same fears and desires and that desire is to live in a fair and equal society in which we feel safe. Too often the media will pit us against each other and demonise our political views which ultimately only serves the elites . You have been taught to think someone like myself is a tree hugging, guardian reading, smug self righteous moralistic do gooder. I have been taught to think you are all racist, ignorant uneducated bafoons who always vote against your own interests and follow the flock like sheep. This is all wrong, we need to all unite together and come up with a shared understanding of how to resolve these issues as while we spend our energy targetting each other the real criminals in all this are getting away with murder!\nThanks so much for writing this great article. Like so many people here, I am heartened to know that I am not alone! I am mixed race (one parent white, one parent black), which has very little relevance as far as I’m concerned – we’re all the same. But I wanted to make sure it is known that not all “non white” people support BLM. It scares the living daylights out of me that these ideas are being pushed and promoted by everything mainstream here in the UK, and that no one seens to do due diligence and simply check out the “what we believe” section of the BLM website.\nI had qualms about the movement before I knew anything about its radical feminist and hard left ideology. All I knew is that the slogan made me feel uncomfortable.\nFirst of all, it made race and racial differences into something, when they are not. Second, black and mixed and other non white people do not need someone to tell them their lives matter. It is pushing a narrative of oppression and victim hood that surely can be no good for anyone. I for one will not bow down to it.\nThanks for reading my comment and again, so heartened to hear that I’m not alone. It is not racist to resist this racist, divisive, and deceptive movement. Let’s just be the change we want to see by continuing to treat everyone with respect. And let’s not give up our freedom of speech on things that are so very important as this. Ideas matter and bad ones need to be challenged.\nI think the issue is much wider than just the politics of the UK or of this or that political opinions.\nIt has been happening for decades in culture and academia, and now it is showing its true face – totalitarian dictatorship.\nTheories, that it all is based on, are racist and fascist.\nThere should be an organized international opposition to this. Our society is very conformist, people are silent, but so much has been written about how conformism helped totalitarian regimes to be installed.\nThanks so much for this. I am white. Therefore, don’t have experience of being black or mixed race. But I have lived in some affluent AND very deprived areas of the UK. I think this has some relevance because I understand that discrimination can take other forms, i.e. class. Not just colour. So people from affluent areas stay clear of poor areas and so on. Because they perceive poor people as different to them. In my very humble opinion, from limited life experience, I think that racism is extinguished once everyone sees skin colour is as unimportant as eye colour. I would love to see some good come from the BLM movement. But all I see is that it is gonna divide us. It is reactionary and although largely peaceful, the violent aspects of it are completely counter-productive. I honestly think it’s net effect will be turning back the clock, even if many people who attend marches think they are doing good.\nI agree 100% – people I have talked with only correlate BLM to mean anti-racism. If you look at their US website it becomes evident that this it is not the case.\nIn a US election year, the Democratic Party is using BLM to win the Black vote. Joe Biden said “If you don’t know who to vote for…then you ain’t black” trying to turn black voters into single-issue voters. #3 of BLM 2020 Campaign goals also targets the vote from Generation Z, which is 52% white, hence the #White Privilege and #Silence Is Violence. There were 235 black people shot by US police last year – why did BLM media not trend then? BLM last trended in the media in the year prior to the last US Presidential election and then has since declined. Is it coincidence that they are trending now? again, they had 235 opportunities last year. 15,500 homicides occurred in the US last year – what were the demographics of those? The US media is highly politically aligned eg major news networks: CNN to Democrats and FOX New Network to Republican – maybe that’s why they are trending now?\nIn the UK they have protested but for what? Removal of statues? The EPL has put the name of a US Socialist organisation on their shirts (for free) and are kneeling to that organisation before both games so far. SKY is broadcasting pro-BLM ads. Where is the BLM UK website? Why do they not have one yet as they have been in the UK since 2016. Why are they not a registered charity in the UK?\nWhy are they only targeting the US, UK and Canada as stated on their US website? Why not Nigeria where a 2017 article from StearsBusiness states that “the country’s five richest men – worth $29.9 billion – could lift 86 million Nigerians out of extreme poverty for one year”.\nThis article in my opinion clearly states the reasons!!!! People need to to understand what they stand for and what their true motives are. Thank you for writing.\nI’m not a member of your political party and happened to stumble across this article on the internet but agree with all of the points that you make. Currently there seems to be a collective blindness to what this movement actually stands for – of course any right-minded person would agree with the 3 simple words that ‘black lives matter’ but that is a very long way from wanting to dismantle capitalism and white supremacy (whatever that is), defund the police and tear down any statues that this movement deem offensive.\nI think it is up to the majority of people in Britain to decide what side of the argument they stand on here – whether they generally support the values and culture upon which this country has been based for centuries or whether they really do agree with dismantling those structures, organisations and culture in an attempt to supposedly eradicate racism against black people.\nI hope they pick the right side and I hope, further, that they have the bravery to stand up and dissent in the face of this insidious, intimidating, intolerant movement.\nIf my Football Club allow “BLM” to be printed on their shirts, and kneel before matches, then I will disown them forever. Keeping Politics out of sport is so important. Where will it all end?\nThe whole message they portray is one of supremacy not equality. They are the mirror of that which they purport to despise. I’ve noticed that most blm gatherings seem to be overwhelmingly white younger people spouting slogans. If we analyse the situation, celebrities are carrying out some unbelievable virtue signalling, Lewis hamilton one of the best examples, spouting the mantra whilst sponsored by companies that used Jewish slave labour. Then there is the irony of taking a knee for George, really? A knee. Then the Cecil Rhodes statue, are they going to stop the Rhodes scholarship? It’s not as cut and dried as blm want us to believe and as for the media and the likes of saddiq Khan, it suddenly becomes the right wings fault regardless because he’s busy protecting his own interest. Most British people accept wrong doing in the past, but why should we respect one man’s cultural heritage as he demands we destroy our own? Also most British people are colour blind, they don’t see a person’s skin, they see a person.\nOk i get the fact that youre political but gods above and below talk about not seeing the wood for the trees!\nYoure piece is full of resentment. Wah wah wah other people than us are doing sonething and its working and people like it! Wah wah wah why arent people listening to US.\nYoure entire piece sounds like a jealous rant because their political activists are better than yours.\nNot one word in your piece deals with the fact this is a reaction to event the entire world witnesses and was appalled by. That is what thousands marched about in America. What is worse you dont seem to deal with the fact that the polls show 84% of americans support the protests even with covid!\nIn this country thousands black and white marched because of their experiences, their mates experiences and because they genuinely believe racism is wrong and there are both racists abd racism in this country.\nYou are perfectly entitled to believe the opposite if you wish but both the stats and peoples experiences dont agree with you and whether you like it or not while you dont accept that how can you be part of the change that removes those experiences\n“This is a reaction to event the entire world witnesses and was appalled by.”\nThe world saw what the media wanted us to see – and yes, we were appalled. But the footage that preceded that event and gave it context was withheld. And when it became available, the media didn’t want to know because it didn’t fit with their agenda. You really have to seek out that footage and the medical evidence if you care enough to want to know the truth. But the media and people don’t seem to want the truth, just hatred and division and avoidance of real issues.\nConcise, perceptive and well written I just wish it could be aired across the media. People are sleep walking into this thinking BLM is just a phrase to reflect ant racism, they haven’t a clue what they’re signing up for and if they have these are very dangerous people. Divide and conquer is a well tried and successful method !\nit’s interesting to read Rob’s comment. I didn’t know so many Americans supported the protests. Maybe a lot of them see it how my dad sees it then. Although he does’t for one minute agree with the movement or what it stands for (see their website), the protests and all the support they’ve garnered might be a mechanism or catalyst for some positive change where change is still needed.\nI think it’s understandable that the protests are much more widely supported in America, as the problems with ingrained racism, police brutality, the carceral state, gun culture etc. are far more extreme there and not really comparable to any other country. I hope your dad is right.\nDoesn’t BLM also stand for destroying the family unit – father, mother, children, etc., putting them all into ‘villages’ (communes) communes? Very scary and the public aren’t educating themselves properly about the organisation.\nSimple a new political party BLM!\nBut then they’d lose all the support and momentum they’re getting from the Democratic Party! Similarly, our own parties here in the UK might stop pandering to them!\nWe have the same issues in Canada, but mainly with indigenous peoples. Indigenous folks (male and female) are much more likely to be murdered. We had a 100 million dollar public inquiry on “missing and murdered indigenous women” that concluded “because racism”. The problem with that conclusion is that the vast majority of murdered indigenous women are murdered by indigenous men.\nSo rather than looking into why indigenous communities are so socially deranged, we try to fix a non-existent racism problem (or one that is so minor as to be non-contributory). And the problems on reserves (welfare dependence, alcoholism, single teen motherhood, drug use, violence, unemployment) are perpetuated. And the longer they last the more sure The Wokerati is that this must be because of racism. And nothing ever gets fixed.\nThanks for a well written, interesting perspective.\nGood article. Youth rebellion against the system is trendy and nothing new. The difference now is that the same youths are working in today’s tech and media giants (BBC,Google, Facebook etc). But the silent majority are not stupid and will not buy this woke pro-BLM propaganda.\nGood article. Youth rebellion against the system is trendy and nothing new. The difference now is that the same youths are working in today’s tech and media giants (BBC,Google,Facebook etc). But the silent majority are not stupid and won’t buy all this woke pro-BLM propaganda.\nI am black couldn’t agree more\nThey came with the transgender grift didn’t work\nNow their back to the original grift\nWhat you gonna do grifters gonna grift\nI work for a large UK corporate company. In normal times the comments that get made on items on the internal news site are so woke it would even embarrass the BBC. But its gone up a gear since they started posting articles on BLM. The level of virtue signalling has to be seen to be believed. And don’t you dare try make even the slightest criticism of BLM or try to push back a tiny wincy bit. Even the “moderators” join in with the attempts to shame, or try to goad individuals into going a bit further. The attitude is very much one of “I can say what I like and the company will back me but if you dare to say something I don’t like you’ll be in the sh!t”. The stuff about dismantling capitalism and defunding the police? Not true apparently. The most interesting bit for me was when someone complained that is alll about “black empowerment” and shouldn’t it be about “BAME”. He was told “Nope not on this occasion. This time we’re specifically addressing racism against black people”. So there you have it – one of our biggest companies wants to put the rights and demands of one ethnic minority group over all other ethnic minority groups. That could get interesting.\n“one of our biggest companies wants to put the rights and demands of one ethnic minority group over all other ethnic minority groups” – apropos that, my friend in Yorkshire (who is one of the only other people I know who sees through all this, and who like me has never voted for a right-wing party in his life) works for a company that employs about 250 people. When this all kicked off, the company issued an apology for not having any black people on their executive board. But the company is in a part of Yorkshire where there are many times more British Asians and eastern Europeans than there are black people. Why is not having specifically a black person on their board a failure or to be presented as such? The panicky corporate overreach is ridiculous. It’s like they’re apologising for not engaging in patronising tokenism, as if the only reason a black person wouldn’t be on the board of a niche SME in provincial Yorkshire would be racism. It’s so paternalistic and insulting.\nI really feel the increasing use of acronyms is unhelpful too. As a gay guy I used to have no problem with the term LGBT until the past few years, as it’s been fairly well-established since the 90s/2000s. I was even open to its expansion with additional letters and symbols (like LGBT+ or LGBTQIA). But sticking your head outside the bubble and looking at how differently ordinary people react to acronyms or unwieldy terms compared to plain speech is really incisive. There are already a number of studies that show public opinion on gay rights differs quite significantly depending on whether the wording “gay” or “homosexual” is used in the survey question – of course they mean the same thing, but people respond markedly less positively when asked “Do you think homosexuals should be able to marry?” than when asked “Do you think gay people should be able to marry?”. The same thing applies to LGBT to a perhaps even greater degree, and it’s something that people in the West aren’t that aware of. At an LGBT-themed conference a few years ago I had to deal with an eastern European girl who thought LGBT was some kind of formal organization, even thought she was LGBT herself. During a couple of the talks she kept asking questions that showed she had a real lack of understanding of the terminology and issues, and instead of supporting her and easing her into the topic, the others there reacted with irritation at her not knowing the right lingo and apparently asking the wrong questions, as if annoyed she wasn’t one of the tribe. It fell to me to actually listen to her, engage with her in plain speech and bring her up to speed, first during the conference when others failed to, then at the dinner afterwards. This belief that LGBT is some kind of shadowy organized network is increasingly widespread in eastern Europe, as it’s an idea promoted by various populist governments in the same way as the Soros thing. Even people with benign, live-and-let-live attitudes to gay and lesbian people in their own countries are increasingly turning against gay rights because “LGBT” is widely understood and promoted as some kind of nefarious, imperialist cultural threat imported from the West, to the extent it’s almost become a slur. This isn’t even going into the issue of how comfortably the LGB belongs with the T these days.\nI think the BAME acronym, which has only recently become widely used in the UK media (it’s certainly newer than LGBT), is starting to come over in the same way. Broadcast, online and print media in the UK used to refer to black people, Asian people, ethnic minorities etc. until fairly recently, which is understandable plain speech – now BAME is used as a sort of media-class in-group cant as if everyone understands what it means, in a way that confounds a lot of ordinary viewers/listeners, shuts them out from the discussion and lumps people from wildly diverse backgrounds into a single category. As a gay guy I absolutely don’t identify as “LGBT” anymore or associate myself with that movement, and I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. It almost feels like a loss. And it’s hardly progress if people with specific cultural backgrounds, like Ghanaian Brits or Jamaican Brits, are expected to identify as generically black or homogenously “BAME” instead. One of my old expat friends from Kenya, who’d lived in a few countries, said that she’d never identified as black or thought of herself as such until she moved to America. A week or two ago on Radio 4 there was a feature with a primary-age girl, whose parents had come to the UK from Uganda, reading out a poem (that she’d obviously been encouraged to write at school) on how wonderful it was being black. It was cute at first but felt more and more disturbing the longer I listened to it, coming from such a young girl, if you’d substituted the word “white” it’d have been absolutely incendiary. If she’d read out the exact same poem but it had been about being Ugandan rather than “black”, it’d have been absolutely lovely. And it feels like a loss, because I’d much rather white people too in this country identified first and foremost as northern or Cornish or Scouse or Scots or Polish, rather than being increasingly radicalized by the incessant focus on race into identifying as “white”. I dread a situation where we’re increasingly all goaded and inculcated into picking a “team”, but it’s already happening. I reassure myself that it’s still mostly a middle-class silly-season media-propagated phenomenon that hasn’t significantly filtered down to ordinary people and middle England, but it’s still disturbing.\nExcellent article. Like other people who have responded, I’m relieved to know I’m not alone. I’m still not sure what can be done about it – but thank you for the glimmer of hope.\nI totally agree with you and if ever put to the vote the silent majority of the UK public would also agree. The BLM movement is making racism worse it is segregating one group from another. All lives matter we all want to be treated the same whatever colour race or creed we are, the BLM movement in what it’s doing is being racist as it totally discounts any other race. What about the 6 million Jews killed in the holocaust the slavery which is happening now affecting all races whether they are black or white. Change will only come from our hearts sadly there is good and bad in every race\nSadly the BLM is contributing to racism and segregation. They are concentrating on one group of people. All races have endured prejudice and slavery during the past and the present, the holocaust killed 6 million Jews, slavery is rife worldwide at this very moment one could go on and on about the atrocities and injustices happening all around us they are not confined to just black people they affecting all sorts of people irrespective of their colour or creed in all different parts of our world. All lives matter whatever race or creed.\nWhat is making the situation dangerous are the media who have jumped on the BLM bandwagon especially the BBC who are meant to be impartial but through their bias are stirring up racial tensions\nThey dont want us to be silent watching our tv’s and sulking because they may well be in their thousands but we are in our millions.\nI was tempted to make a donation to BLM and found your site when googling for details of BLM governance, accounts and regulatory approvals.

Still got free chips after though!\nas appalling as the death of George Floyd was yet again why are We adopting as a Nation another fad from America BLM are just as intolerant as Corbyn’s momentum morons\nThanks for opening eyes to this nonsense, it offends me to see the sheep kneeling at the start of all premier league matches, do any of them understand or have the balls to be an independent human with their own views, or is it the case, any who dare not to take the knee will be classed as racist, trapped without a voice.\nNice to see some F1 drivers do have an opinion and won’t be bullied into the Lewis Hamilton crusade, lets hope he doesn’t make the podium again, It doesn’t sit well with myself seeing him make the black power salute, Does he realise that is a gesture with offensive connotations.\nThe ‘fight’ is not looking to deal with inconvinient issues that keep black communities from achieving their potential; single parent households, criminality, low engagement in education, domestic violence, rampant homophobia and sexism… there is also zero acceptance of the role that African nations played in enabling and continuing slavery. The opportunities that black people have in the west far exceed those in black governed countries. South and East Asian communities have escaped their victim mentalities… BLM needs a mirror more than a megaphone if it really cares about the lives of black people.\nThis is so refreshing, thank you for having the courage to speak out against this racist terrorist organisation that is BLM.\nWhat can people do to hurt BLM in some way?\nI must say that this is a very insightful article. Going against the grain is a difficult path but I believe that in the long run it pays off. The world today sometimes reminds me of the parable of king and the poisoned well. The well from which we’re all drinking has been contaminated with destructive ideologies.\nThe poison was released into the human world by various agents, among them the Frankfurt school, Marx, Lenin, Mao, The British Fabian Society etc. There’s lots of different names and superficially intellectual theories but ultimately it all boils down to the same thing, totalitarian rule on a global scale by a one world Communist government.\nThe people today who have faith in the divine are increasingly marginalized. ostracized, labelled, criminalized and silenced. Ultimately the pendulum will swing back and natural God given order will return. I think it’s important as you stated to think for yourself and go against the grain. Remember as well that when you swim up current you grow strong. God bless\nAgreed.\nPlease make some **practical** suggestions as to how we can resist the BLM/antifa/leftist agenda. Things most concerned individual citizens can do.\nThanks,\nKaren\nYou say we are losing impartiality- as a nation, I think not. However, we are getting the ability to laugh at the absurd squeezed out of us. Whatever happened to satire?\nThey are a tiny minority\nI think this is nonsense; it is created to divide the country and create war. I have friends of all different races, what I do not agree with are people destroying , looting, attacking people to prove a point – lame excuse. also this is going to make people resentful and it will create a war. It needs to stop. The more we go on about one race/culture is actually racist.\nIn regards to the comments on here, some are far fetched. Unless you have researched and done fact checking it is pointless\nJust had the catalogue of women’s clothes ‘White Stuff’ and cannot quite understand the models they have used and the constant overwhelming of black lives matter in a business that I have been happy to buy all my clothes from. I am 67, white and British. Hardly ever a proportion of models of course. Seriously this is getting ridiculous.\nThanks for your article. Our hope is a renewal of Christianity.\nI swear I couldn’t have said this better myself! Brilliantly framed.\nI have a lot of supportive comments but there is not enough room for all Mt pent up comments.\nHitler would not have got anywhere if he hadn’t been backed by German Industrialists and Bankers. BLM is just the Front Organisation, there to convince the Public of its “worthy” aims……just a thought.\nHow many of you in the comments section have a BBC subscription? Otherwise known as a TV Licence? What a lot of you don’t realise is these agendas are set at the international, unelected level. Elections in Britain are rigged and the candidates are bought before they even win.\nThis is the best and most articulate article I’ve read on the subject and comforts me that my worries and concerns are valid and shared. As you say, there’s no clear end to this and over representation and favouritism of people because of their colour is dangerous and hypocritical. I was born in London and spent most of my life surrounded by and unable to escape from certain groups of people who were violent, destructive and ruined my life, and now being promoted into positions of authority simply because of their colour. It’s so wrong and will lead to even worse problems in society.\nBlack Lives Do matter but no more so than any other lives from minorities or indeed majorities. The BLM movement is tearing at the very fabric of the system that has allowed them to voice their opinions, a form of Anarchy that is permitted as to do otherwise would look like racism.\nHamilton is undeniably a great car driver, I would go to him for advice on how to tune my car’s suspension but regarding politics and historical accuracy I would go elsewhere. As one of the elite in terms of money he has in fact most to lose if the fabric of this country and others were to be replaced with BLM policies.\nPoor old Marx would be spinning in his grave with his name being associated with this establishment sponsored rabble. The function of BLM is to divide those in whose interest it is to make massive changes to our capitalist society into that of a Social Democratic economically based society. It is noticable that year after year we have some “issue” foisted upon on us in the most confrontational terms whether it be Brexit, race relations and now Covid. Rational discussion flies out of the window. And most of it comes from the USA, fast descending into chaos and collapse.\nAll you racist worms should be publically executed. You’re evil and irrational, and society has no need for you.\nSky Sports have promoted BLM taking advantage of the lockdown. Had the crowds been in attendance the “taking the knee” would not have been tolerated. It is about George Floyd a criminal in the USA. This has nothing to do with the UK or any other European nation. When Millwall fans booed the media came up with the usual nonsense but found that more public in general agreed with it. I find BLM very provoking. When the guy at Burnley in the plane had the banner “White Lives Matter” he did nothing wrong if it is OK to say Black Lives Matter then we have a double standard. He even lost his job. The UK is not yet the 51st State and is an entirely different nation, with both History and Culture. Both Black and White are not natural to the USA the indigenous people are the Native Americans. The situation in the UK is entirely different\ni served two tours of northern Ireland back in the 80’s, so any organizations, media’s and music bands that supported or funded the IRA in any form i would neither listen, buy or entertain in any manner ( that was my protest). With black lives matter I do the same, the very obvious over representation of black programming and advertisement and again media input supporting this disturbing group,( I switch off, turn over and do not read), for example; I receive a regular fashion catalogue and I am usually happy “until” 3/4 of the models were black or of mixed race, i cancelled this service. I WILL NOT BE PUSHED in what I see is a kind of bullying of our minds. This has made me very angered and i would like to say i agree with every statement you make. SO IF THIS MAKES ME A RACISIST SO BE IT…..\nThis WOKE cancel culture is extremely disturbing. All that matters is if they are offended by anything then it must be removed from existence. How about the millions offended by anti White racism? Cross dressing men sharing the same public toilets as women and young girls? Trans men in womens sports. NORMAL peoples values are not considered.\nWhat the hell are these pro nouns these cretins are using ‘they / them’ do they have multi personality disorder? There are only 2 genders, if people want to believe they are of a different gender then so be it, but keep it to yourselves. I really hope this has triggered some of those freaks, I despise them\nEvery time I hear that phrase, I ask myself, just who in hell do Black Lives Matter too?\nSensibly, And well put, We need MORE honest and Brave voices as yours,\nGod Bless\nWe were all made in the same image of god, or so I was thought. If anyone throws their own views on you it’s their own insecuritys. And I was a uk soldier and have been about, and received racism for being white, In London!. The black fella,s sucking their teeth at me?. It’s the human condition we’re all fucking mad. Roll on nuclear war!!!\nBlack Lives Matter is racist.\nDown with BLM!\nBLM is stirring up racism like we never had in this country, BLM should be banned and if these riots sorry protests keep happening then the government should come down hard on them with stronger sentences, as these “protesters “ are nothing more than criminals\nI come from a White poor background I’m talking 8 people living in a roach infested 2 bedroom 1bath house aka POVERTY..and I for one am so grossly tired of hearing about BLM right now it makes mee naseusious There aren’t any White College funds or any similar “WHITE” funds out there that am aware of we were on welfare before food stamps and believe me we struggled… on just sick of everyone’s complaining about being victims I was always taught There are no victims only volunteers. And on top of the story I’m gay too. I am definitely not a racist perhaps I’m more of a realist I had nothing to do with slavery and I think it was s terrible thing. But other black tribes captured people from other tribes and sold them to whom ever wanted. I mean hebrews were slaves to. Just how far into history do we need to go.",

Taylor and Matthew Kirtley.\nFOREWORD\nDebt-fuelled consumption is not prosperity.\nThe claim made in this Green Paper – that our debt-driven economic order is unstable, harms prosperity and causes beggary – is epochal. Its consequences are revolutionary.\nTo say that neoliberal economics has worked is to deny reality. The data shows that for the past forty years, economic growth and private sector profits in the UK have mainly come from plundering the assets and wealth of society and the state. Long-term social prosperity has been sacrificed for short-term private gain. The ultimate cause of this has been a set of ideas rooted in a species of liberalism which amounts to indifference.\nWe have become indifferent to what is made where and by whom; to the loss of secure employment; to huge regional divides; to persistent trade deficits and relentless de-industrialisation and to the attachment citizens have to their localities and nation.\nThis type of economic indifference has coincided with equivalent apathy in the social sphere. Those that govern us show indifference to the steady disintegration of the family; to the need to secure homes for young people wishing to raise children in safe communities; to rising levels of ill-health, obesity and drug dependence. In the political arena we had – until recently – even become indifferent to who, ultimately, governs us and whether we can remove them from power.\nThankfully, the liberals of various types who’ve been in charge for a generation are finding themselves on the wrong side of history.\nThe age of indifference is closing – and not before time.\nWilliam Clouston\nParty Leader\nSocial Democratic Party\nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nOver the past forty years, Britain’s profit model has degenerated. Rather than economic growth and profits coming from businesses producing more value, they now come from the public and the government spending more than they earn. This broken profit model lowers incomes, fosters inequality and destroys the wealth of all but a few. It cannot be allowed to continue.\nTo exit this model, we propose a programme which pursues the following four targets: reducing dissaving, raising investment, resetting the balance of trade, and conserving natural capital.\nTo reduce dissaving, the government must:\n1. Mandate the Bank of England to guarantee that household debt rises no faster than median household income.\n2. Impose a moratorium on buy-to-let mortgages.\n3. Prevent the Bank of England from setting the base rate below the natural rate of interest.\nTo raise investment, the government must:\n4. Limit net migration to 50,000 per year.\n5. Apply a modifier to a company’s corporation tax burden, reflecting the median amount of time employees spend with the company.\n6. Target R&D investment to grow to 4% of GDP.\nTo reset the trade balance, the government must:\n7. Set a targeted goods trade deficit of 3% of GDP.\n8. Target a competitive exchange rate of 1:1 sterling-dollar parity.\nAnd to conserve natural capital, the government must:\n9. Invest £4 billion more per year in next generation energy and emissions technologies.\n10. Create new “circular economy” Special Economic Zones with distinct tax and regulatory regimes.\nThese ten proposals are to form the first steps of a new economic model, which will see growth and profit cease to come from undermining our future wealth – the effective plundering of the prosperity of the people and the state.\nUnder our proposed new economic model, growth and profits would be the result of a tangible and sustainable expansion of the industrial base. The result would be a society which is wealthier, more just, and can guarantee the prosperity of future generations.\nBRITAIN’S\nPROFIT\nMODEL\nIn 1954, the Polish economist Michał Kalecki demonstrated that the total profits of all companies within a society must equal their savings. Kalecki then showed that changes to this corporate profit must equal movements in the savings made by all other parts of the economy. To capture these findings, Kalecki summarised them with the following equation:\nCORPORATE PROFIT\n=\nNET INVESTMENT\n—\nHOUSEHOLD SAVINGS\n—\nGOVERNMENT SAVINGS\n+\nTRADE SURPLUS\nKalecki, 1954\nThis mathematical identity – the Kalecki profit equation – allows us to calculate the rate of corporate profits across a society, and to discover the extent to which profits come from investment, government borrowing, household borrowing or exports.\nUsing data from the national accounts, we can use the profit equation to see how Britain’s corporate profits have changed over time. On calculating this, we find that since the Second World War corporate profit has mostly come from:\n- net investment (investment in new property, plant, and equipment), and\n- dissaving by governments and households (ie, spending being greater than income)\nFigure 1 shows that there have been two distinct periods of corporate profit generation since the Second World War:\n1948 – 1980: This period saw net investment trend upwards and become the dominant source of corporate profit, with an average share of 56.7%. This meant that corporate profits and growth were mostly driven by investment into new capital goods (such as property, plant, and equipment), which in turn could be used to create more economic output. We will call this arrangement the investment-driven model of profit and growth.\n1981 – present: This period has seen dissaving trend upwards and become the dominant source of corporate profit, with an average share of 65.9%.\nThis means that corporate profits and growth were mostly driven by a combination of households and governments spending more than their incomes on goods and services. We will call this arrangement the dissaving-driven model of profit and growth.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the ascendency of the dissaving-driven model has been a great boon for the corporate sector. From 1948 until 1980 corporate profits averaged 18.9% of GDP, whereas between 1981 to 2019 they averaged 25.5% of GDP (ONS, 2018, 2020a, 2020b).\nHowever, by contrast, the dissaving-driven model has performed poorly at improving economic output. While per capita GDP grew at just under 3% per annum between 1950-80, it has grown by just under half that since then. (Gudgin, 2018).\nUltimately, while the corporate sector has prospered under the dissaving-driven model, the rest of society has not. This is because the dissaving-driven model brings with it two major problems.\nThe first problem with the dissaving-driven model is that the reduction it brings in net investment reduces productivity growth, since net investment is what provides workers with new capital goods to grow their output. A fall in productivity growth means a fall in real wage growth, since wages are a function of the output of workers.\nAs a result the incomes of wage-earners will grow more slowly – at worst, they may stagnate or fall as inflation erodes their spending power.\nSadly, wage stagnation has indeed been a reality for most workers in recent decades, with median posttax earnings falling by 1% in real terms between 2010 and 2018 (Panjwani & Reland, 2019).\nThis can be traced back to flatlined productivity growth – which, as shown in Table 1, began to fall in the 1990s. This productivity collapse can be tied to a sharp fall in net investment at the start of the decade, as shown in Figure 3.\nThe second problem with the dissaving-driven model is that it erodes non-corporate wealth in an economy.\nThis is because households must find ways to finance the continual deficits demanded by the dissaving-driven model, which means that they must deplete their savings, liquidate their assets, or take on debt. As shown in Figure 4, the final option has proven to be wildly popular among consumers, with the total credit held by households exploding from 29.8% of GDP in 1980 to 84% of GDP in 2019. Government debt has also ballooned, the main driver of this growth being its indirect taking on of consumer debt via bank bailouts in the late 2000s.\nThe long-run consequences of households forgoing savings and continually taking on debt are bleak. Since corporate profitability now depends on the household sector’s ability and willingness to take on more debt, the dissaving-driven model encourages low interest rates to maintain borrowing and the economic status quo. These depressed interest rates reduce remaining incentives to save and can eventually destroy existing savings via negative real interest rates. This encourages wealthy households to shift savings into assets – such as property and shares.\nThe additional demand for assets, combined with easier access to credit, causes the value of assets such as housing to unsustainably balloon, further dissolving the wealth of the rest of the household sector through higher rents, mortgages, and deposits. What featherbeds the wealthy beggars the rest of society.\nREBALANCING\nTHE EQUATION\nIn short, Britain’s economic model since 1980 has:\na) Pushed down earnings through strangling productivity\nb) Indebted and eroded the wealth of households outside the corporate sector\nc) Encouraged asset price bubbles, which induce cycles of “boom and bust”\nInstead of creating and generating prosperity, our economic structure instead entails the long-term beggary of the household sector and the government. It runs utterly contrary to the idea of a sustainable and sane economic system.\nThere is nothing ‘natural’ or ‘inevitable’ about this model. It is a distortion of recent origin, which started in the 1980s and intensified dramatically after that. Thankfully, this means it can be dealt with through a policy framework which consciously seeks to rebalance the profit equation through rewarding investment and limiting further debtbased beggary.\nThis will take time: the distortion of our current incentives has taken decades to fully reveal itself, and the reset will take time to produce results. However, it is both possible and necessary.\nThrough rebalancing the profit equation, we would create a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable Britain. Rather than the illusory “growth” delivered by borrowing against future generations, this new economic model would enrich the nation by making it more productive. This rebalancing would do more than just alleviate the issues of stagnant wages and debt – it would see Britain as a whole become wealthier, more equal, and reinforce its role as a major technological and industrial power.\nDETERRING\nDISSAVING\nCAPPING CREDIT\nOne of the main ways to generate corporate profit in the dissaving-driven model is through household debt. As shown earlier in Figure 4, household debt as a share of GDP tripled from 30% in 1980 to 93% in 2009 (Bank for International Settlements, 2020). Although household debt as a share of GDP has fallen since then to 84% of GDP in 2019, this still means that the debt-to-disposable-income ratio among households was roughly 130% in that year (House of Commons Library, 2021).\nIf British companies are to be weaned off the dissaving- driven model, then the main mechanism which makes dissaving viable in the short-run – household debt – must be capped. The level of household debt must be reduced, relative to both GDP and household income.\nThe best way to achieve this is to ensure that debt growth does not outstrip income growth. Between 1988 and 2019, household income rose by an average of 5% a year (ONS, 2020a), while during the same period lending to individuals (excluding student debt) rose by an average of 7.3% a year (Bank of England, 2021).\nThus, the government must mandate the Bank of England to guarantee that household debt risesno faster than median household income.\n1\nPROPOSAL 1\nMandate the Bank of England to guarantee that household debt rises no faster than median household income.\nENDING\nHOUSING\nSPECULATION\nSince 1996, the average UK house price has risen by 160% in real terms. As shown in Figure 5, the ratio of median house prices to earnings in England and Wales has more than doubled since 1997 – the average house is now valued at nearly eight years of median income.\nMulheirn (2019), notes the consensus among economists that a 1% increase in Britain’s housing stock can be expected to lower house prices by 1.5% – 2%. Given that the UK housing stock has consistently experienced such a rise over the past decades, the corresponding rise in house prices can only partly be attributed to a deficiency in supply.\nInstead, we must go back to the question of debt. As of 2018, 90.6% of household debt was held in the form of property debt, which mainly consisted of mortgages (ONS, 2019). The ballooning of household debt and the corresponding explosion in house prices are closely related to one-another. All else being equal, greater mortgage finance leads to higher house prices. This causes a vicious cycle of debt growth, because higher house prices will require a greater quantum of future mortgage debt.\nThe main drivers for heightened demand for mortgages are twofold:\n- The introduction of buy-to-let mortgages in 1996 which encouraged a flurry of house purchases from asset-rich investors\n- Mortgage rates tumbling over the past decades, with the inflation-adjusted interest rates on five-year fixed-rate mortgages falling from 8% to around 2% in 2019\nA perpetual rise in house prices damages the ability of first-time buyers to own property – and to start families – while also serving to siphon income and wealth away from non-owners through increasing rents. It is neither economically and socially desirable nor sustainable.\nSadly, many homeowners and landlords have been encouraged by decades of irresponsible political leaders to treat housing as an asset – rather than a home – which should constantly appreciate. In truth, there is no good reason to assume that house prices should constantly and consistently grow, and such perpetual growth brings profound social harms. While it has become a third rail in British politics, the necessary adjustment cannot be delayed any longer – housing prices, relative to income, must come down.\nTo end the overvaluation of house prices and help first-time-buyers finally acquire property, both above challenges must be confronted. Our first proposal, to mandate the Bank of England to guarantee that household debt rises no faster than median household income, is an important start. However, it must be built upon.\nSince their creation in 1996, buy-to-let mortgages have provided a lucrative means for prospective landlords to acquire rental property for little upfront investment, and often very little risk. As a result, buy-to-let mortgages can be identified as one of the principal drivers of rises in house prices and rent. Therefore, the government must impose a moratorium on buy-to-let mortgages and re-mortgages.\n2\nPROPOSAL 2\nImpose a moratorium on buy-to-let mortgages\nREVIEWING\nTHE INTEREST\nRATE\nIn addition, ultra-low interest rates have only served to deliver illusory and fragile growth by making money cheap. This further inflates asset prices, encourages further levels of unsustainable debt and discourages saving by households.\nSince the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the Bank of England has become hostage to artificially inflating consumption through setting and holding ultra-low base rates. Fearing the inevitable short term contraction that must come from reigning in unsustainable levels of debt, the Bank of England has continually avoided the issue of raising interest rates, with members of the Monetary Policy Committee now openly contemplating negative interest rates.\nLimits must be imposed on the Bank of England to end this short-term perspective, and to remove its ability to set a base rate that harms long-term prosperity. To do so, they must be given a quantifiable lower bound which reflects the current needs of the economy.\nThankfully, such a limit exists in the form of the natural rate of interest, which is the interest rate that would support the economy at full employment while keeping inflation constant, and which can be calculated through economic modelling – it is currently estimated at around 1.9% (Evans,2020).\nThus, government must leverage this data and require the Bank of England to set the base rate no lower than the natural rate of interest.\n3\nPROPOSAL 3\nPrevent the Bank of England from setting the base rate below the natural rate of interest.\nRAISING\nINVESTMENT\nCLOSING GLOBAL\nLABOUR MARKETS\nAt the very heart of the relative decline in investment are conditions in the labour market. Over the past forty years, labour markets have become ever-more ‘flexible’, owing to a combination of conscious political choices, the unanticipated over-relaxation of national borders, and technological change.\nThis is exemplified by the continued decline in trade unionism, which is a strong indicator of workforces that are rooted and have a powerful bargaining position with their employers. Trade union membership levels peaked at 13 million in 1979; they fell sharply throughout the 1980s and early 1990s and have declined steadily since. As shown in Figure 6, trade union representation as a whole – especially in the private sector – has continued to atrophy over the past decades.\nThese increasingly flexible and mobile labour markets have led to the erosion and breakdown of traditional expectations and loyalties between labour and management. This is deeply corrosive. In such an environment:\n- Labour has less expectation that management will care about them, and consequently will be willing to change employers more often\n- Management has less expectation that their workforce will stay in the long-run, and so has less interest in training and investing in their employees\nThis mutual lowering of expectations means that both employers and employees become less willing to invest in each other, which caps productivity growth and real wages.\n4\nPROPOSAL 4\nLimit net migration to 50,000 per year.\n5\nPROPOSAL 5\nApply a modifier to a company’s corporation tax burden, reflecting the median amount of time employees spend with the company.\nOver the last decades, these tendencies have accelerated as businesses have had access to essentially unlimited ‘casual’ labour, mainly from Eastern Europe. Between 2004 and 2019, Eastern Europeans accounted for 48.2% of the total rise in UK employment (ONS, 2021a).\nFaced with the choice of raising output by either a) investing in new plant and equipment to raise output per worker or b) introducing temporary workforces from Eastern Europe, too often the rational – but short-term – choice has been the latter. So, along with damaging domestic training efforts, over-reliance on open international labour markets has deterred investment in the capital goods that would provide long-term expansion of the economic base.\nPrior to the late 1990s, net immigration seldom exceeded 50,000 per year. Since then Britain has experienced a wave of net migration with no precedent in the nation’s history, with net migration having remained above 100,000 since 1998 and averaged 251,600 per year throughout the 2010s (ONS, 2020e).\nAstonishingly, in certain 12-month periods since the year 2000, more people migrated to Britain than had been the case in the whole period from 1066-1950 (Goodhart, 2013, p. xxix).\nAny strategy aiming to encourage greater domestic investment in human and physical capital must start by accepting that hyper-open labour markets are not viable. Thus, the government must end the post-1997 era of mass migration and limit net migration to 50,000 per year.\nRESETTING\nEMPLOYER\nINCENTIVES\nReducing access to international labour markets is an important first step on reducing the flexibility of Britain’s own labour market. However, it also requires incentives for employers to care about their employees, encourage investment, and raise the expectations between management and workers.\nA novel solution is needed to shift the incentive structure for labour relations, so that investment in workers becomes a positive-sum game for both employers and employees.\nTo achieve such a shift in the incentive structure, we call for a rework of the framework of corporation tax to reward strong and rooted relationships between employees and employers. The tax system should recognise the difference between employers who look after, retain and develop their workforces, and those whose business models depend on casual labour.\nUsing the ‘polluter pays’ principle, those businesses relying on the casualisation of their workforce should be taxed at a higher rate than those who look after their workforce well. This would be judged by tracking the median amount of time a company’s employee has been with the company (adjusted per sector), with this measurement included in the annual financial audit.\nThis tax differential would reset the incentive structures for a company’s management, so that when managements must choose between investing in plant and equipment, or hiring casual labour, the incentives will tilt towards the productivity -raising former option.\nUnder this system, employers who underinvest, undertrain or simply mistreat their workforce, would be unable to retain their staff and would consequently pay a price for it in higher corporation tax. Conversely, ‘good’ employers who invest in and develop their staff will be rewarded for their contribution to the community, and the tax advantage would add to that company’s overall competitive advantage.\nPROMOTING\nRESEARCH &\nDEVELOPMENT\nResearch and development (R&D) are the means by which the productivity of capital, labour and land are improved. In the long run, this investment is one of the most crucial means by which a society is enriched.\nBritain should be a natural hub for investment into research and development initiatives. The United Kingdom hosts several of the world’s most acclaimed research universities, is the nation of origin of the global lingua franca, and is the birthplace of the industrial revolution.\nDespite this, UK R&D expenditure across the public and private sectors represented just 1.7% of GDP in 2018. By comparison the average R&D spend across the OECD is 2.4% of GDP, with Germany averaging 3.1% (House of Commons Library, 2020).\nThe government has begun to address this by setting a short-run target for total R&D investment at 2.4% of GDP by 2027. However, this is inadequate given Britain’s comparative advantage in this area.\nWith the business sector performing 68% of R&D (Ibid.), the government’s main tool to raise R&D investment must be through expanding existing tax relief schemes for both small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and large companies. The expansion of these schemes should target R&D investment rising to 4% of GDP.\n6\nPROPOSAL 6\nTarget R&D investment to grow to 4% of GDP\nRESETTING\nTHE TRADE\nBALANCE\nSo far, we’ve focused on two parts of the profit equation: dissaving and net investment. However, there is a third component to corporate profits, which is the balance of trade. As shown by the profit equation, corporate profits can be bolstered by a trade surplus. In this way, generating a trade surplus can serve to help reduce the dependence of corporate profits on dissaving.\nFor the past forty years, the story of British trade has been one of an ever-steepening goods trade deficit which has been offset by an ever-climbing services trade surplus – but not by enough to escape an overall trade deficit. As shown in Figure 7, Britain has not run an overall trade surplus since 1997 and has not run a trade surplus in goods since 1981. As of 2019, Britain’s overall trade deficit cost 1.24% of GDP.\nIn some circumstances, a trade deficit can be a good thing for an economy. A large influx of goods and services can represent a boom for consumers and producers, and kick-start economic growth.\nHowever, in a developed nation, long periods of trade deficits will ultimately harm domestic growth. This is because trade deficits must be financed – which means either taking on debt, selling assets, or selling off equity. All these measures reduce future domestic economic output. If a trade deficit endures then the reduction of an economy’s long-run capacity would far outstrip any short-run boom. The nation would ultimately become poorer.\nSince the 1980s, these concerns have been dismissed by the purist advocates of free trade who now dominate policymaking. They argue the following:\na) Britain’s trade deficit in goods has arisen because the imported goods are cheaper than their domestic alternatives\nb) Since consumers and producers are saving money on goods, they have more money to spend elsewhere in the economy\n7\nPROPOSAL 7\nSet a targeted goods trade deficit of 3% of GDP.\nIn practice, this has not been the case. While free trade may improve the purchasing power of consumers, Gudgin (2018) notes that this period has not seen heightened economic growth: whereas per capita GDP grew at just under 3% per annum from 1950-80, it has grown by just under half that since then. Neither has this increased purchasing power from consumers been enough to build their wealth, with household debt nearly tripling since 1980 (see Figure 4).\nThe key problem with purist free trade theory is that, in the real world, in order to prosper the public must be both consumers and producers. While consumers benefit from slightly lower costs for manufactured goods, this has been more than offset by the macroeconomic effects of free trade, in part because of the loss of manufacturing industry.\nFree trade has proven a disaster for many communities whose economies were based on low and mid-skilled manufacturing. Britain’s free trade regime has seen these jobs systematically moved offshore.\nFurthermore, gutting our industrial base has spawned the twin side-effects of political alienation and bitter cultural division.\nUltimately, unfettered free trade places downward pressure on employment by destroying ‘uncompetitive’ industries. It also stunts wage growth by forcing domestic workers to compete with cheaper foreign labour that is not subject to similar working condition protections.\nAlongside the damage done to jobs, wages, communities and growth, Britain’s trade imbalance has rendered the nation less resilient to shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The contraction of its manufacturing base has induced a reliance on over-extended global supply chains to provide it with manufactured goods, which have proved easy to disrupt, while also causing significant environmental damage.\nHence, reshoring industry and the domestic production of goods must be a key economic goal for Britain in the medium-to-long run. The government should start by targeting a reduction in Britain’s goods trade deficit to 3% of GDP, down from roughly 6% today. This should be pursued through a continually evolving programme of tariffs, capital controls, and tax incentives to encourage firms to reshore manufacturing.\nDiscussion: The Road to Bruddersford\nThe way our economic model has eroded is well illustrated by considering the archetypal example of ‘Bruddersford’.\nBruddersford was JB Priestley’s amalgam of the Yorkshire wool towns he knew so well, places which he described as wearing ‘a grim and resolute look’. In the 1950s and 60s, Priestley envisaged Bruddersford as a ‘little forest of mill chimneys’ most of which are ‘only puffing meditatively, for it is Saturday afternoon’.\nBruddersford’s millionaires made their fortunes selling their textiles to Paris, London, New York, and this export trade made it, at one time, home to the densest population of Rolls Royces on the planet. The World Bank, no less, wrote books about how countries could and should take ‘The Road to Bruddersford’ to secure modest prosperity even when the raw materials were discouraging.\nToday, only rags and tatters of Bruddersford’s textile industry remains, and the forest of chimneys have long gone. In their place, the major employers are the (unloved) local authority, the health services needed by its increasingly unhealthy and aging population, and the university. Currently, the scope and size of\nBruddersford’s health services are threatened, because the government wants, or possibly needs, to drive business (ie, the sick) towards a new PFI hospital some 30 miles of inadequate road away. This initiative is needed primarily because the cost of servicing the PFI contract is putting pressure on all other health budgets in the area.\nAs for the university, although this business has expanded to be Bruddersford’s economic salvation – and welcomed by landlords of both sorts – it is a business with only two substantial sources of revenue: government grants and the debts taken on by its students.\nBruddersford used to earn its profits through investment and exports; now it survives in its reduced state on government and student debt.\nA\nCOMPETITIVE\nEXCHANGE\nRATE\nFor decades, successive governments have neglected a crucial policy tool that could be used to encourage investment and reset Britain’s trade balance. This is the exchange rate.\nIt is a long-established economic truism that, all else being equal:\n- An overvalued exchange rate begets cheaper imports and can in some cases dampen inflation. However, overvaluation comes with the cost of making a nation’s exports less competitive, causes imports to outcompete domestic products, and reduces the purchasing power of investments in plant, property, and equipment.\n- An undervalued exchange rate can encourage inflation in some contexts and increase the cost of some imports. However, undervaluation also makes a nation’s exports much more competitive, protects domestic firms from foreign competition, and encourages more investment into plant, property and equipment.\nThus, a competitive exchange rate is associated with more jobs, increased investment and thus higher growth. Consequently, any government committed to improving the size of its economic base and encouraging industry should pursue a competitive exchange rate.\nYet despite this sterling remains the world’s most overvalued major currency; UBS’ 2018 Markets Outlook found that, at its then conversion rate of £1 to $1.32, the pound was overvalued by 19% (Martin, 2017).\nSince Britain adopted a floating exchange rate in 1971, there has been a great deal of hesitance and indifference by successive British governments in doing anything to ensure the sterling is competitively valued. Rather than pursue an exchange rate that delivers prosperity for the economy, the Bank of England and Treasury have yielded to the belief that short-term market forces must go unchallenged in determining the value of stirling.\n8\nPROPOSAL 8\nTarget a competitive exchange rate of 1:1 sterling-dollar parity.\nHowever, as shown by recent examples such as Japan, whose government successively managed to bring the value of the yen to the dollar down by a third between 2013 and 2015, it is perfectly within the power of the government to influence a floating exchange rate (Mills, 2020, p. 219).\nMuch of the work of encouraging a competitive exchange rate only requires that a government openly commit to it as a policy goal, which will in turn shift market expectations to cause a fall in the pound’s price on global markets.\nHowever, it will also require the government to adopt measures that will push down the demand for the pound on global markets. Encouraging a competitive exchange rate will entail:\n- Deterring acquisition of British assets by foreign buyers, through public interest tests on foreign acquisitions and a tax regime to discourage foreign buyouts of British assets.\n- Changing the mandate of the Bank of England to no longer support sterling as the Bank’s default position, but instead selling the sterling as required on global markets when its price is too high.\n- Providing easy-to-access domestic financing facilities for investment in British businesses, to provide competition against foreign capital to encourage devaluation.\nIn general, the end goal of these policies will be to encourage sterling to set to a sustainable long-term equilibrium exchange rate that delivers investment, jobs, and growth and encourages a reversal in Britain’s long-standing trade deficit. Given sterling’s current overvaluation, an initial target should be for the government to achieve parity with the US dollar.\nRESTORING\nNATURAL\nCAPITAL\nA theme shared by all the economic problems discussed in this paper is that they sacrifice longterm prosperity for short-term gain. On a societal level, this is a classic example of what is called high time preference – a tendency to heavily prefer an immediate payoff, even at the expense much higher future payoffs. British politicians from both major parties persistently make this error.\nSo far, we’ve examined the costs of an addiction to cheap goods, over-reliance on debt and aversion to investment, which can all be viewed as high time preference behaviours. In addition, Britain’s dissaving-driven model of profit and growth has encouraged another high time preference behaviour: environmental destruction.\nNatural capital – the resources provided to us by the environment – is of tremendous importance and is something from which every section of the economy derives value. From natural capital we draw the raw resources that are necessary for our society and economy’s existence: whether it be oxygen, fresh water, crops, fish, or minerals.\nAll our natural capital has slowly accumulated over the course of the past 4.5 billion years. It cannot be quickly replaced, and its depletion or destruction will impose huge costs on future generations. For this reason, our natural capital must be priced in as part of any economic model which seeks sustainable and long-run growth.\nIn this century, Britain faces many environmental threats. However, successive governments have procrastinated on real solutions to this issue, owing to an unwillingness to challenge the high time preference of policymakers. Instead of looking at the constellation of environmental issues that are facing Britain, elites and successive British governments have instead chosen to myopically focus on the question of domestic emissions reduction. As we argue in the above discussion section, this is a fundamentally flawed approach.\nThis approach must change. Britain’s environmental agenda must shift away from a focus on emissions reduction, and towards one of replenishing the Earth’s natural capital.\nIn practice, this will require a long-term focus in two areas Britain can make a substantive difference:\n- restoring the extensive forest ecosystems that once existed across the British Isles\n- replenishing the marine environments across the United Kingdom’s exclusive economic zone, which spans 6.8 million square kilometres.\nWith such a strategy of environmental stewardship within Britain’s territory as a bedrock, Britain must then look to use its industrial and technological prowess to solve underlying global challenges such as the climate crisis and resource usage. Rather than throttling Britain’s economic growth and prosperity, we must use the British economy to forge the tools and techniques humanity needs to prosper beyond the 21st century.\nREVOLUTIONISING\nENERGY AND\nEMISSIONS\nWe believe that Britain’s main contribution to preserving and bolstering natural capital cannot be centred on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Rather, its principal goal should be in leveraging its position as a scientific and technological powerhouse to develop the technologies which may be able to mitigate or reverse the climate crisis.\nIn particular, the government must directly invest in:\n- energy technologies such as grid energy storage, Generation IV nuclear fission reactors (designed and built by Britain) and the ultimate prize of nuclear fusion\n- carbon capture and storage technologies\nGovernment must allocate and coordinate these investments under the rubric of an overall energy and emissions technology strategy, which leverages the expertise of science and industry.\nAs these technologies offer a very high return on investment and will be of global significance, the government’s investment in this strategy should be comparable to the UK Research & Innovation budget (currently ~£8 billion per annum). Initially, government should target an investment of £4 billion per year.\n9\nPROPOSAL 9\nInvest £4 billion more per year in next-generation energy and emissions technologies.\nDiscussion: Hard truths and the climate crisis\nWhen political leaders and businesses have discussed environmental concerns, they have mostly been preoccupied with reducing Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions. While a noble goal, the problem is that no reduction in Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions, including their entire elimination, can make any significant difference to global emissions. The United Kingdom contributes only 1% of total carbon dioxide emissions, compared to China’s 28% and the United States’ 15%. Britain is towards the bottom of emissions league tables, with per capita emissions lower than they were in the 1850s (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2020).\nOn a global level, we must face a hard truth: current global policies and agreements regarding emissions have failed, are failing, and will continue to fail. The rise in global greenhouse gas concentrations continues to accelerate, driven by developing nations who are seeking to improve output and living standards – most prominently, China and India.\nA plan to tackle climate change that hinges on hitherto impoverished nations curtailing their pursuit of prosperity is not realistic. Despite the long-run risks that climate change poses for China, India, and other developing nations, it is unlikely that they will resist a common pattern for human civilisations: no society in human history has made the conscious decision not to grow, not to expand, and not to deploy its ingenuity and efforts to secure what it sees as its material improvement.\nThe prime responsibility for growing CO2 emissions now lies with developing nations. A preoccupation with domestic carbon emissions in Britain is, effectively, a displacement activity which diverts attention from environmental restoration which the UK could actually achieve.\nCREATING\nTHE CIRCULAR\nECONOMY\nAn extra opportunity Britain is well suited for is the development and discovery of how to build and operate a “circular economy”. A circular economy can be understood as an economy in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible – partly by resisting built-in obsolescence- and their maximum value is extracted.\nOnce a product has reached the end of its service life, a circular economy then works to recover and reuse the raw materials within an item.\nDescribing in detail what a circular economy would look like is currently impossible: or rather, any such description would be a necessarily flawed exercise in imagination. That is because a circular economy is necessarily a holistic venture, and any effort to develop it within the context of an individual company or industry can only be partially successful.\nNevertheless, the fact that companies in many sectors in many parts of the world are trying to put circular economics into practice indicates that the idea itself is appealing. At the heart of circular economics is an aspiration that resource usage should be as efficient and circular as possible.\nIn its industrial interpretation, this means that every by-product of every industrial process should be engineered to be the input to another industrial process. By extension, when an industrial product comes to the end of its useful life, its components should be able to be recycled for the next cycle of product: this is ‘cradle to cradle’ resource usage.\nThis vision of industrial processes may involve recycling, but its ambition goes far beyond that. A circular economic approach would not just dictate how things are made, but also in how they are designed, distributed and ultimately how they are financed or legally underpinned.\nThe circular economy is an Industrial Revolution in waiting, promising a total change in resource efficiency, which ultimately allows growth and prosperity to be compatible with environmental stewardship. Britain is unusually well-suited to discovering and developing such an Industrial Revolution, not least because historically it has the world’s best record in managing such fundamental and dramatic changes in its economic structure.\nBy its very nature a circular economy cannot be designed or imposed. However, it is possible to earmark Special Economic Zones entirely and exclusively dedicated to developing Circular economy forms, practices, services and products. Within that SEZ, it would be possible to repurpose VAT to zero-rate inputs of products and services which are themselves certifiably part of the circular economy. For example, when a company uses recycled plastics as a key input, those inputs would be zero-rated for VAT purposes. In theory, a wholly circular product would then enjoy a 20% price advantage over its non-circular competitors.\nMoreover, having an entire SEZ dedicated to developing circular economics would also have to involve not merely production and distribution, but all the infrastructure needed to develop these economics. This would encompass design, legal, accounting, production engineering, distribution and financial services.\nA sufficiently large circular economy SEZ would attract investment from the range of companies currently working in isolation to develop circular economy practices, and would also attract a talented workforce from across all sectors among those who have a vision of squaring the circle between prosperity and the environment. The practices and innovations developed in these new SEZs could serve as a template for a new industrial model for Britain and the world.\n10\nPROPOSAL 10\nCreate new “circular economy” Special Economic Zones with distinct tax and regulatory regimes.\nCONCLUSION\nFor over forty years, corporate profits have grown by gradually undermining the prosperity of everyone else. To function, Britain’s dissaving-driven growth model has diminished the wealth of most of society by plundering savings, requiring onerous debts, making property unaffordable, and suppressing wage growth.\nThe winners of this model have been the minority whose prosperity is driven by corporate profits and asset prices. They have won by impoverishing those whose prosperity is driven by wages and savings.\nWe argue that this model is, ultimately, selfdefeating. It is a negative-sum game which creates a poorer, weaker and less stable society. This path is inhumane and destructive. For this reason, we call for the end of the dissaving-driven model.\nAt the heart of it, this entails that the profit equation must be rebalanced. Businesses must predominantly generate their profits through expanding the economic base, rather through plundering the wealth of the nation via debt.\nTo achieve this goal, we have set out the following ten proposals:\n1. Mandate the Bank of England to guarantee that household debt rises no faster than median household income.\n2. Impose a moratorium on buy-to-let mortgages.\n3. Prevent the Bank of England from setting the base rate below the natural rate of interest.\n4. Limit net migration to 50,000 per year.\n5. Apply a modifier to a company’s corporation tax burden, reflecting the median amount of time employees spend with the company.\n6. Target R&D investment to grow to 4% of GDP.\n7. Set a targeted goods trade deficit of 3% of GDP.\n8. Target a competitive exchange rate of 1:1 sterling-dollar parity.\n9. Invest £4 billion more per year in nextgeneration energy and emissions technologies.\n10. Create new “circular economy” Special Economic Zones with distinct tax and regulatory regimes.\nWhile crucial steps, these proposals alone cannot mark a comprehensive solution to the challenges above. Rebalancing the profit equation will be the most ambitious governmental project since 1945 and will require the use of virtually every economic tool at the disposal of the British state.\nA total change in the mindset of the British state must accompany the flagship proposals we have set out. These alone cannot bring an immediate end to the structural problems facing the British people. They can, however, mark an end to forty years of indifference and in doing so set Britain on the path to genuine prosperity.\nREFERENCES\nBank for International Settlements. (2020, December 7).

And we meet at an important time – before a general election. So first, I’d like you to imagine, if you will, the plight of the ordinary British voter in an ordinary British election. You turn up at a polling station with your card, get your ballot paper, enter the booth… pencil at the ready… to put your cross against… against what?\nIt’s at that moment you see the dreadful choice before you. A list of political parties that have beggared the country – none of which share your values. And that’s the outstanding and appalling fact about British politics today – the establishment parties are simply not good enough.\nSo, in all humility, I’d like to offer the British voter some advice. To offer just 8 points about the next election. This is a Dear Voter speech…\nPoint 1 – Vote positively and vote freely\nThe right to vote was won against massive resistance. Voting is a right and a duty but it’s also an opportunity.\n“For people in this country who don’t have money or power in industry – it’s the vote that’s their main safeguard for the future.”\nThat was Tony Benn in 1976. Benn was right and the 2016 EU referendum – and the reaction to it – proved he was right. So vote positively. If, like us, you believe that railways and utilities should be in public ownership – vote for it.\nAnd remember that no vote is wasted. The 79 votes that Auberon Waugh received as the ‘Dog Lovers’ Candidate’ against Jeremy Thorpe in the 70s weren’t wasted. At the very least, they sent a message – that it’s wrong to shoot people’s pets. I’m being flippant, but you get the point.\nPoint 2 – Don’t vote Tory\nI can’t stress this enough. Because the Tories see this country not as our home but as a shop. Is that fair? Let’s look at the evidence…\nPublic assets – which we already owned – sold off: British Gas, British Coal, British Steel , British Energy, British Rail, British Ports, Royal Ordnance, 10 separate water companies, 12 separate electricity boards, The Severn Bridge, The Royal Mail… I could go on. Many of these are now under foreign control – which means profits siphoned off abroad. Utilities turned into a casino – with no regard to the long term effects to our rivers or our balance of trade.\nAs Harold Macmillan said at the time… ‘first the Georgian silver goes, then all the nice furniture and then the Canelettos go…’ True.\nBut fencing off national assets doesn’t stop there. Our key industrial firms to been picked off one by one by foreign competitors. Cadburys, Rowntree Mackintosh, ICI, British Steel, Pilkington, Corus… again, I could go on. No sensible state does this. The South Koreans don’t do it. The Japanese don’t do it.\nSelling the family farm is in the DNA of the Tory party. Proof piles upon proof… They are the asset strippers of British politics – and of Britain itself. Remember, this is the party that traded away our fishing waters – which is a bit like owning an orchard and letting people take the apples. In fact, allowing the country to be run by the Tories is like putting a child in the hands of someone with the parenting skills of Jean Jacques Rousseau or Karl Marx. Unwise. This is not conservatism of any description. It’s low, base, spivvery. And it’s unpatriotic.\nA few months ago I was at Kings Cross waiting for my train. I needed to fill my water bottle but the tap on the first floor was out of order. I was told there was a water station in the corner on the ground floor… when I reached it I saw it required me to download an app to dispense the water. It wasn’t a public water fountain. It was a machine for trading data for drinking water… Who allows this to happen? What are their values?\nA wise person once said: If you screw the workers you screw the company. I think, if you screw the people you screw the country. Everything, it seems, is for sale.\nThe Portuguese poet Luiz Vas de Camoes in his epic work the Lusiadas chronicled the age of discovery. It’s a magical poem. Caravelas traversing shipless oceans, across the horizon into the new world. There’s a line where Camoes writes… ‘And if there had been other lands to discover, we would have found them’. I think, if there was anything left to sell… the Tories would have sold it…\nPoint 3 – Don’t vote for anyone that doesn’t know what a woman is\nNow, two years ago on this very stage I mocked Rachel Reeves on this… but the confusion continues. Nick Ferrari poses the question: ‘So a woman can have a penis? Ed Davey replies: ‘Well, quite clearly’.\nAndrew Marr asks the question: ‘Is it transphobic to say that only women have a cervix?’. Keir Starmer replies, ‘It’s something that shouldn’t be said. It is not right…’\nWhat a mess. Do you really think Starmer and Davey can’t tell Arthur from Martha? Really? Or are they just scared of telling the truth? But seriously, treating transgender people with dignity and respect does not require the deconstruction of the meaning of the word woman or the denial of women’s rights. Trans women are not women. If they were the prefix wouldn’t be required. What we need is respect for reality. And the reality is that some people have gender dysphoria but, also, there are boundaries – in sport, spaces and other places – where sex-based rights must come first. That’s reasonable – which is why it’s SDP policy.\nWhether they know it or not, Starmer and Davey are part of a progressive war against observation, objectivity and reason. Basically, a war against the enlightenment foundations of the west. This is serious. This must be defeated and it will be defeated by mobilising the majority who oppose it.\nJohn Gray put the opportunity perfectly: “The left gave up the struggle against class inequality a generation ago, replacing it with the self-serving poses of bourgeois identity politics, while liberals colluded with corporate capitalism in dismissing the dying communities of America’s post-industrial wastelands as retrograde sections of humanity. It’s too late for progressives to regain working-class support.” Correct. It is too late. We’ll see them at the ballot box…\nPoint 4: Elect national leaders, not charity workers\n’I think it’s my job to maximise global welfare not national welfare.’ Famously, that was Gus O’Donnell former Head of The Civil Service. Now you might ask – how do you become Head of the Civil Service if you think like that? But this view is normal among the new elite. They’re conditioned to criticise and repudiate Britain’s past which leads to a disposition – an attitude – of civilisational guilt, apology, atonement and self-effacement. ‘Charity syndrome’ is the result. That’s what you get. So instead of tackling our own problems, our elite – rather pompously – prefers missionary work. They think about Lagos when it’s their job to think about Leeds. The Scottish NHS thinks about reparations when it should be treating Scots. This is because they see Britain not as a country but as an NGO.\nIn this atmosphere, the idea of ‘national citizen preference’ – actually governing in the interests of your own people – becomes impossible. National self-assertion collapses. The best example of this capitulation is the collapse of our national border. And yet the people that govern us seem to have no idea how dangerous this is.\nMy point is – as we’ve seen from the tragic events in Israel, the chaos in Lampedusa and the war in Ukraine – the world is a very dangerous place. The West is drunk on civil rights but short on duty. What we need is protection. As Philip Kiszely said recently – wanting the keys to your own house is the most natural thing in the world. And you can’t have that without a border.\nPoint 5: Don’t Divide Us\nI wish it weren’t so, but we’re going backwards. American race-based politics have been imported into the UK. We didn’t ask for this. It’s not just the Critical Race Theory which our institutions have lapped up. A general racialisation of thinking has seeped into our culture. At the banal level it’s people saying things like… this town, or the countryside or Radio 3 is so white – as if that’s a crime. And very often the person saying this is white.\nSadiq Khan – whose officials think a white family can’t ‘represent real Londoners’ is a specialist in this type of division. Labour’s Anneliese Dodds is another – keen to blame any racial disparity in mortgages, rent payments, health, whatever – on systemic racism. This is simplistic nonsense as Tony Sewell’s CRED report exposed – based on nostrums too brittle to withstand any proper scrutiny.\nAnd it’s self-defeating. Constantly attacking your own country as racist, the country that nurtures you is like cutting off the branch you’re sitting on. And only a fool would do that – or someone that actually hates the whole tree. We want a more equal society and if you deliberately divide people into opposing camps something important is lost, namely, the social solidarity that we all need to share and to succeed.\nAnd on the question of building social solidarity – we must end our reckless addiction to mass immigration. Like any other addict, the dose this country requires to get a hit goes up and up. We’re now importing over 1m people a year – a sure sign of a labour market in crisis. Plundering doctors and nurses from poor countries is certainly immoral. I’ve worked in a hospital in West Africa. If you remove nurses kids don’t get innoculated and they die. But this policy also disincentivises training and lowers wages here in the UK. It must do. Meanwhile, over 5m fellow citizens are on out of work benefits effectively left on the scrapheap.\nThe impact on social cohesion of rapid demographic change has barely been considered. It’s a fundamentally mistaken view, I think, to believe that a continuation of very high immigration without any thought to integration will make community relations better. It won’t. On the contrary, it becomes more challenging.\nLook at the scenes of people in Manchester and London – or Rotterdam and Sydney for that matter – openly celebrating the murder of Israeli civilians. Social division has become a critical question across the west. I think if we want to remain anything like a coherent society a generation-long mass immigration pause is essential. It’s a pre-conditon. The country needs a breather. We need the space and the time to find a new us. But to return to my main point to voters – there is no future in grievance politics – for any of us – so don’t vote for it.\nPoint 6: Vote for conviction politicians\nIn other words, vote for people who believe in a few things and will actually fight for them. Imagine a man… who opposed the monarchy but takes a knighthood. Who fought bitterly to prevent his country from governing itself, but now can’t do a press conference without a standing next to a British flag. Who became leader of his party by promising to take railways and utilities into public ownership but then suddenly changed his mind… Who wanted to abolish tuition fees… but now doesn’t. A man in other words, who cannot make a pledge without reversing it. You know the man I describe…And the point is this. When a person is as flexible as Starmer – you have to ask – does he actually believe in anything at all? More to the point… how would the public know?\nPoint 7: Trade Deficits Matter\nLet me just say, you know I talk about the deficit a lot – but it’s critical. If you think we can run trade deficits of tens of billions year after year and not slide deeper into debt you can’t add up, This isn’t some elaborate economic theory, it’s just accounting. We just get poorer. It’s Beggars Day.\nAll of the good things: transport, the NHS, education, roads, defence, pensions are predicated on how this country makes its way in the world. How we earn a living. And the cretinous ramblings you hear – particularly from Labour politicians – about spending cuts are meaningless unless you understand that trade – both internal and external and the taxing the proceeds of trade underpins all state spending. You can’t tax a loss. You can borrow, but in the long run you spend what you earn.\nAnd on the other side you have free trade purists who argue that our deficit is somehow a vote of confidence in UK PLC. They’re just kidding themselves. It’s like a crack dealer telling their addict – no, I really believe in you. Conservatives used to understand this.\n“It is in fact a waste of time to consider at length where we stand as between the alternatives of Free Trade and Protection. We’re offered no such choice. We must choose between Protection and one-sided free imports… And if this indeed be the choice, I am a protectionist.” That’s F. E. Smith at Chatham in 1909. He was right.\nWe’ve been getting trade policy wrong for 40 years and many of our factories have closed as a result. Trade policy must serve the national interest not ideology. We know that our trade problem will only be cured when we end our indifference about what is made where and by whom.\nBefore I make my final plea to voters, I have a few thank yous to make and a quick review of the year. It’s been another good year for us. After Wayne Dixon took Middleton Park in Leeds in 2022 my advice at last year’s conference in Manchester was keep on going and win again. And we did.\nDespite a massive resistance by Labour and a lot of money spent, Emma Pogson-Golden took the SDP’s second seat on Leeds City Council in May securing nearly 2,000 votes. But there was more to it than that. Emma worked in a local school. But as an employee of the Council she couldn’t stand in a Leeds City Council election. So Emma gave her job up – a job she loved – in order to stand for the SDP in her community. If you want to know why the SDP wins elections in Leeds – you have the answer just there.\nIn May we fought local elections all over the country and we contested 3 Parliamentary by-elections in the past year. Julien Yvon stood in Stretford and Urmston in December – during a postal strike – gaining valuable experience for the North West region. In June Steve Gardner stood in Uxbridge, gaining a very creditable 6th place out of 17 candidates. And John Waterston stood in Selby getting our highest percentage vote in a by-election since 1989. Well done all. By-elections are tough but you get better at doing something by doing it.\nA few thank yous: A thousand thanks to Valerie, Robert, Paul, Dan, Ross and Paula the key office holders of the party. Without whom… Thanks also to my colleagues on the National Coordinating Committee and to all our candidates, campaigners and regional organisers throughout the country. Thanks to Michael Taylor – my co-presenter on Wednesday Night Fightback. Thanks to Paula and Kathy – authors of the forthcoming SDP Green Paper on Agriculture. Thanks to Olly for his film making. Thanks to Kyn and William for technical assistance. And thanks to Rod Liddle, Patrick O’Flynn and Joanna Williams – journalists who are ‘out and proud’ Social Democrats. Special thanks to the London Branch for staging the conference, to our guest speakers and to all of you for coming along. Thank you. And finally, thanks to the wider SDP… all over… from Wendy’s pottery, to the Young Social Democrats, to Peter Wheeler’s Tweetings. We are the SDP.\nSo, to my final and most important point to voters. Last year we said: ‘It can’t go on like this’. But it will… unless we do something about it. The cure is to vote for a party which sees Britain not a shop or a charity but as our home. A homecoming. At the start of my speech I talked about the plight of British voters in a normal election – but the next election isn’t going to be a normal election. Because for the first time in decades millions of people will once again have the chance to vote for the Social Democratic Party. A party that believes the things they believe and will build the country they want.\nOur manifesto will be defined by our beliefs: The social market, the family as the foundation of society, decent affordable housing, in voting reform. The belief that industry matters, that you can’t be a state without a borders, that we must cure ourselves of our twin addictions of debt and mass immigration. And, most importantly, that we must bring this country together to find a new us.\nThe SDP has never been – and never will be – in the angry corner of politics. We’re not concerned with single issues or the selfishness of particular groups. Our mission is the concerns of the mainstream majority. That’s where the real power of social democracy lies. In mobilising that majority.\nSomeone once said that you should do three things in life: Build a house, write a book and stand for parliament. Well, not everyone can build a house. And I think Chris Hitchens was right when he said ‘everyone has a book in them and in most cases that’s exactly where it should stay. But standing for parliament – that’s very possible.\nWhat I’m asking for is all hands on the SDP deck. If you can donate, please donate. We’re not bankrolled by big money or unions. That’s why we have our own voice. If you can help out, please do so. If you can stand for election, please step up.\nNext year we aim to make history. To get our best result in a generation. And to re-establish the SDP as a truly national party once again. That will be a homecoming – for us and for the country. We have a wonderful chance here. All of us. Let’s take it.\nThank you.\nGood points made.\nTo what extent does the SDP relate to the ‘Blue Labour’ wing and thinking within the Labour Party?\nCan William be the next Prime Minister forget Sunak, Starmer and Dozey Davey I cannot stand them or their parties I have never regretted joining the Social Democratic Party three years ago in April 2020 I hope to be involved in the Party’s future direction for when the British People turn to the sdp once they finally realise by Continuing to vote for the useless 3 old parties is harming themselves and the Country, We could be a Government one day\nGood to know that we are growing.\nGreat speech. But Reform UK are getting all the publicity with their by-election performances. I am not the first to raise it, but I doubt whether the label ‘SDP’ signifies much to the average voter, let alone that this is a party with true conservative values. The existence of the much better known ‘SNP’ does not help matters.\nAny thoughts?",

We have allowed are politicians, and elites to savage institutions, history, immigration, and are Western culture, house is just part of the every growing problems.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_new-declaration/content_388.html": "INDEPENDENCE\nFree from vested interests, the SDP seeks the common good in Britain’s national interest. We represent neither capital nor labour, not private industry nor the public sector, but only the welfare of the British people and residents of these islands. We seek a path where all the constituent elements of our society can grow and prosper.\nDEMOCRACY\nFirst and foremost, we are democrats. The scale and vehemence of the reaction against the result of the 2016 EU referendum by Britain’s cultural and political elites was striking. The evident disdain of the Westminster class for, among others, many elderly and low income voters revealed that the powerful only tolerate democracy when their view prevails. The authority of the establishment to decide what happens has been challenged and the SDP stands behind the referendum mandate. Respect for all voters implies respect for the result.\nWe hold that the old Labour/Conservative duopoly is harming our nation. The Conservative party has conserved very little and instead, has put everything up for sale. Labour has abandoned the nation’s working men and women. To preserve what is best in our nation Westminster must change. Our outdated voting system stifles political competition and denies new entrants a chance to contribute. As a result, people rightly feel powerless, with their voices ignored at Westminster. Reform of Britain’s broken political system is long overdue, and we will be at the forefront of reinvigorating democratic politics.\nWe hold that public services such as education and the NHS have been badly let down by the two-party system. Labour and Conservative governments have produced wild swings in expenditure with periods of unsustainable spending followed by periods of austerity.\nWe consider the nation-state to be the upper limit of democracy. Along with the family, we regard it as indispensable to the solidarity of our society and concern for our fellow citizens. We regard supranationalism as a neoliberal ideology aimed at neutering domestic politics and placing the most important issues beyond the reach of ordinary voters. The European Union or any other supranational entity is not – and will never be – a social democratic enterprise.\nNATION AND WORLD\nWe are unionist, patriotic and internationalist. The ecological and demographic challenges of the 21st century require international coordination, and Britain must play a leading and constructive role within the UN, NATO, the WTO and the Commonwealth. However, Western powers must learn to respect sovereign frontiers. While showing solidarity with democrats everywhere we oppose the disastrous attempts to impose liberal democracy on complex societies in the Middle East via military intervention.\nWe are committed to maintaining strong, independent Armed Forces and Intelligence Services to protect our country against external military and nuclear threats as well as from terrorism and cyber-warfare.\nWe consider the progressive desire for people to shed their national identities and unite in a pan-European or universal civilisation to be a recipe for conflict and hopelessly utopian – as unrealistic and harmful as the dismal communist project.\nEurope’s strength is the diversity and distinctiveness of its local, regional and national cultures, which enhance our sense of place and our security, and provide mutuality and meaning to our lives. We believe the homogenisation of national differences and weakening of local cultures by both unchecked capitalism and utopian idealism is dangerous to both individuals and society, rendering them less stable, less happy and less resilient to crisis.\nWe cherish heterogeneity between nations and regard the peaceful coexistence of different cultures as a fundamental social democratic goal. The nation-state, the national home we have built and defended over centuries, reflects a deep and genuine human need for belonging, and realistic international policy must champion this.\nWe will vigorously resist the naive ambitions of both ‘open border’ zealots and neoliberal ideologues in the interest of Britain’s community relations and the survival of our hard-won welfare state. Britain’s immigration policy must be skills-based, needs-based, legal and subject to democratic control.\nWe believe the UK must lead by example in being at the forefront of global action to combat climate change and pollution from plastics and other sources. Government must incentivise business to develop new environmentally friendly technologies. We believe that animals are sentient beings and we are committed to the highest standards of animal welfare.\nSOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY\nWe believe that pro-public sector and pro-market policy can beneficially coexist within a balanced programme – provided each inhabits its correct domain, and neither is allowed to distort our country’s economy in the service of ideology. This is the SDP’s distinct Social Market position.\nThe public and private sectors are complementary parts of our society and should not be regarded as opponents. We believe that open, competitive, free markets are the best and most efficient system for providing general goods and services, the ordinary matters of trade which are our nation’s lifeblood. We believe that free markets make a vital contribution to a successful economy through investment, by creating employment and by raising living standards. Government must ensure such markets thrive. However, successive governments of both Right and Left have forgotten that markets are justified by their social function. The power of the market has over-reached, fraying the social bonds which bind us together.\nBritain’s increasing inequality and the tendency for markets to be dominated by fewer but larger corporations is troubling – as is the avoidance of taxes morally owed to society. This must be corrected. Businesses, the wealthy and all other members of society must behave responsibly and pay their taxes – although in a geographically mobile world, tax rates should not be set so high as to be self-defeating. The market will either be reformed by social democrats who are friendly to it or be undermined by those who are not.\nWe support an active Industrial Policy. Britain urgently needs a strategy to improve productivity and to provide a long-term planning framework for the skills, technologies, energy resources and transport infrastructure required to support businesses.\nA weak, inept state, fearful of powerful global corporations, cannot serve its citizens properly. We believe the state has wrongly ceded key parts of its rightful domain to global capital and has lost confidence in its own capacity for direct provision and intervention in the service of the nation. We believe that out-sourcing – as a tool to avoid democratic responsibility – has strayed well beyond its useful limits.\nThe correct frontier between the public and private sector is determinable. Natural monopolies – the utilities requiring universal delivery to citizens – should be returned to public ownership and operation or be subjected to significantly more effective regulation. The dismantling by both Labour and the Conservatives of public sector capacity in public housing, rail transport and the utilities – and the selling off of the nation’s assets to foreign ownership – is a historic mistake we must rectify. An optimal Social Market frontier must be restored and respected.\nWe believe that intergenerational equity requires that the constraints of sound government finance are respected. There is nothing moral in leaving future generations with unmanageable debt. On the contrary, it is anti-social.\nTHE FAMILY\nWe believe a stable and secure family life – with support from the extended family and the community – to be the foundation of society and critical to raising responsible citizens. It is in the home where we first learn the virtues of obligation, compassion and concern for others which transcend self-interest. And yet successive governments have been powerless in resisting an epidemic of family breakdown which has caused widespread suffering and has harmed the life-chances of millions of children.\nGovernment must defend and support family life whenever possible, particularly in welfare and economic policy, education and housing. We will shelter British families from the economic and social pressures fracturing our society, and rebuild a prosperous and happier nation with policies that place the working family at the heart of national life.\nCOMMUNITY\nWe believe in a more equal society, free of prejudice. However, a society which possesses no unifying values cannot build the solidarity to succeed. We must be one – irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation or creed and we must engage with fellow citizens as equals. We reject the current obsession with grievance and identity which divides our society into hostile and opposing camps. We favour strengthening the common bonds which unite us and, in so doing, re-enforcing communitarian impulses in public life.\nIt is mistaken to view every departure from ethnic, class or gender proportionality as prima facie evidence of discrimination. Some group differences merely reflect free choices and preferences in a open society. We hold that civilised toleration of such differences is necessary if we are to avoid descent into bitterness and conflict. We believe the shared ‘identity politics’ of both the far right and far left to be inherently divisive and self-defeating. For many years the liberal-left has abandoned the politics of solidarity for those of individual emancipation, without realising that putting differences above common bonds can harm mutuality.\nWe believe ‘fraternity vs division’ to be a key watershed question in all Western societies. Fraternity must prevail.\nWe regard kindness and mutuality as a political rather than a legal achievement which relies on free consent rather than legal obligation. Excessive individualism – of both the social and economic variety – has regrettably led some citizens to believe they don’t share a common fate with their neighbours. They do.\nTOLERANCE\nWe are concerned that our long-standing culture of tolerance has fallen from favour. There is now insufficient viewpoint diversity among the academic and cultural elites who presume to set our nation’s course. A dangerous myth has emerged which holds that cultural questions are capable of rational arbitration which must, inevitably, lead to a single liberal-left view.\nCitizens holding a traditional, patriotic or religious outlook are often bullied and marginalised, stifling the open debate upon which a free and democratic society depends. From government to the police, from universities to schools, the politicisation of Britain’s institutions in the service of fashionable ideology is leading to a loss of faith in the pillars that uphold our society. We believe instead, that a free and democratic society must hear different opinions in politeness and respect in order to thrive. We pledge to uphold the values of freedom of thought and speech which lie at the heart of British democracy.\nCULTURAL RENEWAL\nGlobalisation and the labour mobility driven by the unfettered free market has made it harder for ordinary citizens to raise secure families in the stable communities upon which a healthy society depends. However, the liberal-left tends to blame culturally embedded problems solely on spending cuts instead of acknowledging that many of our problems stem from decades-long shifts in attitudes and values. Too often the narrow politics of individualism take precedence over the interests of the wider community, with some being quicker to demand rights than to assume responsibilities. Welfare and public services should be used responsibly. If not, the mutuality upon which they depend will be eroded.\nA widespread values and virtues-led cultural renewal is needed, aimed at improving citizens’ happiness, health and well-being. Government – along with civic society – must play its role. We are communitarians. We reject laissez-faire libertarianism as indifferent and ineffective.\nThere is such a thing as society and, as Jo Grimond rightly said, it is as necessary to the individual as water is to fish.\nOUR FUTURE\nSocial reconciliation is the essential task of democratic politics for the next generation. The collapse of the British people’s faith in the two parties who have mismanaged our nation presents a rare and precious opportunity to reform British politics in the service of the national good.\nThe SDP aims to provide a political home to all social democrats who seek a stronger and more capable state along with greater individual responsibility, trust and social solidarity.\nThese are the new politics of Britain’s 21st century radical centre – defining the limits of the market and the state and harnessing them both to rebuild Britain. In staking out this fair and sensible centre ground, we believe we speak for Britain’s hidden majority.\nThe New Declaration is a call for participation based on a simple premise: if we want a social democratic programme there must be a Social Democratic Party.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-human-hive/content_227.html": "One of the most famous illustrations in history is the title page of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan. It depicts a king towering over the land, his body composed of thousands of people. The image stands as a powerful and enduring metaphor that captured Hobbes’s central claim – the state was an artificial person built from the coming together of the people under a social compact.\nThe looming leviathan on that title page was supposed to be a metaphor for the source of the state’s legitimacy. However, our burgeoning knowledge of biology and the human condition is starting to suggest that, in a way, that image isn’t a metaphor at all: human societies are living organisms. They are superorganisms.\nA superorganism is a group of many smaller organisms which, as a whole, behave like they are a single organism. Our bodies are good examples of superorganisms, with each of us composed of upwards of thirty trillion human cells working in concert with each other, in addition to over thirty trillion more symbiotic bacteria. This means that the behaviour of any single blood cell, skin cell or neuron in the human body can only really be coherently understood through understanding the behaviour of the body as a whole.\nRemarkably, however, superorganisms are not just restricted to creatures made of microscopic cells. There are a few animal species that behave as superorganisms, which we call eusocial animals.\nOne of the most well-known examples of a eusocial animal is the honeybee, with many a beekeeper being able to attest that a hive’s behaviour is only ever comprehensible if the beehive itself is understood to be an organism that’s directing the activity of the bees that make it up. The behaviour of a female worker bee – who won’t reproduce, yet is willing to die for the hive via its stinger – makes no sense at the individual level, but it makes a great deal of sense when the bee is understood as but a part of the beehive.\nAmong animals eusociality has evolved in only a few species, with ants, bees and wasps being the most notable examples. To capture the idea of the eusocial unit, the rough consensus is that eusocial animals are ones that: a) live in social units with overlapping generations, b) engage in the cooperative care of the young, and c) divide reproductive labour.\nThe last point – the division of reproductive labour – is probably the defining feature of eusocial animals. In honeybees, we see this through females being split between a queen and a sterile caste of workers; for the worker bee, this reproductive division of labour means their main drive cannot be their own ability to reproduce, but instead the success of their relatives and hive-mates. This reproductive division of labour prompts the evolution of specialisation, through creating behavioural groups that are devoted to catering to the group’s survival over their personal survival.\nHumans clearly tick the first two boxes of eusociality, since we live in social units of overlapping generations and engage in the cooperative care of the young. But we also possess what may be the most important part of eusociality, in that we can divide up reproductive labour. That’s because we have the menopause.\nContrary to popular belief, the menopause is not an inevitable result of the ageing process. The menopause is incredibly rare within the animal kingdom with the females of most species being able to reproduce until they pass away. In fact, among the entirety of the natural world, only two groups of animals experience menopause – whales and primates. And from among these animals, human females undergo menopause at by far the earliest point in their lifespans.\nThis means there’s nothing biologically necessary about the menopause, which in turn means it can only be understood in evolutionary terms as an adaptation that was selected for. In humans, the development of the menopause countless millennia ago must have served to create a clear division of reproductive labour. The menopause sees the labour of post-menopausal women “freed up” from the task of bearing children, which means that energy that otherwise might be directed to creating and raising their own children is invested into caring for their broader families and communities.\nNot coincidentally, this reproductive division of labour has meant that humans have developed the overarching property common to all eusocial species – specialisation. Even among those of us who can reproduce our economy and institutions encourage extreme specialisation in our work, which means that our day-to-day activity is taken up with processes that only make sense when viewed at in the context of serving societal demand. A bureaucrat, factory worker or doctor tie their prosperity up with servicing specialised societal needs, rather than doing their own paperwork, appliance manufacturing or healthcare for themselves.\nJust as a beekeeper can attribute intent and direction to a whole hive, human eusociality means that we can see a society as having a life and will of its own. Viewing society in this way, and accepting the idea that human communities are superorganisms, has major political and philosophical ramifications. Much of our basic frame of reference for making societal and political decisions is couched in the interests and rights of the individual. Human eusociality subverts this.\nIf human society is a living organism, then its own rights and interests must be worth consideration independently (and often above) the rights of individuals. The basis for modern political philosophy – especially liberalism – rests on the idea that the role of politics is to provide a means to navigate the rights and interests of individual humans. But if a society is a living creature in of itself which exists separately of any one individual or discrete group, then it makes such philosophy untenable: the living superorganism’s interests and rights must be built into our conception of what is good.\nOn a more practical note, viewing society as a superorganism may cast light on why the modern world – despite its material prosperity – is failing to deliver purpose and meaning for so many.\nThere’s a growing medical and psychological literature showing our mental wellbeing, and even our physical health, is derived from being allocated status and given pro-social ends to direct our energies. That is, a need to be a useful part of the superorganism is baked right into our psychological wiring. Those that are allocated status and purpose tend to have a markedly different hormonal profile to those who are not, with the latter ageing faster and being markedly more likely to develop depression, anxiety, heart disease, and even cancer.\nThe concepts covered above have all come well after Leviathan’s time, so understandably it was not a feature of Hobbes’s philosophy. However, that striking visual metaphor from that book’s front page could not be more apt.\nRather than, as Hobbes suggested, societies being founded on consent, they are founded on something even more ancient and intrinsic to the human condition. We have always been but cells in a much larger body – that is our true state of nature.",

And, as current events demonstrate, it is often crossed. But among the many ironies of the current assault on Britain’s history, the University of Liverpool’s decision to remove William Gladstone’s name from its buildings stands out for its ignorance.\nWe may not agree with Gladstone on everything, and we are right to scrutinise his record. However, perhaps more than anyone else in our history, he was one to elevate good government in the national interest. His reforms of the British civil service led to this country’s reputation for effective and largely incorruptible national governance. They created an administrative elite comprising men and women of great ability and probity.\nWas this elite unimpeachable? No.\nWas Gladstone himself flawed? Of course.\nBut, to paraphrase the philosopher Immanuel Kant, humanity is made of crooked timber.\nNot long after I watched Gladstone’s name being cancelled, the current government confirmed that my three children weren’t being allowed to return to school.\nThey can now go shopping. They can sip a lemonade in our local pub. An education with their friends and classmates, however? Of course not.\nHow have we sunk so far? How is it that we are not allowed to see one of our greatest Prime Ministers named, but we must watch the administrative standards he fostered crumble in front of our eyes?\nIn truth, this confrontation with reality has been coming for a while. For it is now blindingly obvious that many among our elites crave the appearance of virtue rather than the thing itself. In this bizarre parallel universe, being highly competent is less important than holding the ‘right’ views. Doing things which improve lives is less important than signalling that an organisation thinks in the ‘right way’.\nThe resultant hollowing-out has been visible for years, most obviously in the media, but also, increasingly, in the police.\nThe effects in government and the civil service are less obvious, but should concern us equally. During the Covid crisis the NHS’s frontline professionals have bailed out their managerial and political masters. The lions have, again, saved the donkeys.\nHowever, this only reveals a much larger, and more alarming, truth: the British state has not had a good crisis. We are not being governed well. We have barely coped while other nations have excelled.\nSadly, things are likely to get worse before they get better. The need for a strong hand on the tiller has rarely been greater. The need for competence and common sense among our leaders, in all fields, has seldom been higher.\nThe Victorians certainly had their faults. But they knew something about running a country. They would have spotted the difference between contemporary virtue signalling and real virtue. They understood that the latter required hard work, not slogans. They knew that social progress came from building, not destroying.\nThe slow death of our administrative traditions has left the United Kingdom desperately vulnerable at a time of national crisis – and the elites which got us into this mess surely cannot get us out of it. They are trapped inside a bubble, bouncing off walls which have become impermeable to reality.\nMeanwhile, look around the major political parties and it is hard to see anyone who might lead us through these dangerous times. Hard to see who will speak for the administrative standards of our forebears, whose memory is erased while these present elites either cooperate or stand by and do nothing.\nI have to agree with your reflection on the state of our government, with the comment “lions led by donkeys” being particular apt.\nAnother exellent article , it seems as if the adults have left the room as far as taking some sort of responsibility for this mess.\nOur PM, not unreasonably, has tried to act in a liberal intellectual manner with his colleagues. He has been up against an agenda driven media and an opposition who would happily destroy the general populous resolve for their own ends, looking to programme us. The pandemic was a gift to them. Problem they will find is that British people can’t be easily moulded.\nThe Tory Government over the last 10 years has been the worst since WW2 and over the last 6 months has hit rock bottom. Having divorced some genuine friends in Europe, we seem to be blindly heading into a trade deal with the USA. Welcome to chlorinated chicken and hormone enriched beef : goodbye to our NHS which the Tories have privatized by stealth since Thatcher and not helped by Blair’s PFI contracts.\nThe only way out for the UK is a government of true proportional representation whereby the interests of the country are put well before personal careers and political idealogy.\nI agree that the May and Cameron ministries were contenders for the worst since WWII. The degree of incompetence and woolly thinking was staggering to behold. I am also concerned about heading headlong into strategic reliance on the US, which is a capricious power and will exact a step price for any such relationship. However, I do not understand the problem with chlorinated chicken. It’s fine.\neven worse than Blair or Brown\nI wouldn’t trust America as far as I could throw it nor the corporatist EU\nI strongly agree with the sentiments expressed in this article, it is as if our countries elites have stagnated and fallen asleep at the wheel.\nIn the last 40 to 50 years the governance and thereby the steerage of our country has been offshore.\nYes, we do need people of vision and strength of leadership and thus far we have not seen this from any quarter. By December 2020 we will know our standing with or without an EU deal. Personally I believe a deal\nnow is not as important as Britain’s future world trade and self-governance. By then we need to be moving forward with our own plans for the countries future trading partnerships.\ngrowing up in the Thatcher Years and living through the equally awful era Governments of both Labour & Tories are bad We need a new alternative Cameron Blair May Brown and Johnson are globalist shills https://www.getborisout.com",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_silenced-is-not-golden/content_42.html": "You could be forgiven for thinking cancel culture is a luxury affliction, the price celebrities and other high-profilers pay for stepping out of line. That is, until it arrives at your door.\n“Tony, can I have a word with you?” And so it begins.\nA customer service assistant in the public sector, I’ve just arrived at work and before I can take off my jacket, I’m having to follow my manager as she hurries through the workroom and up the stairs to her office. She tells me I am being suspended on full pay while allegations of misconduct are investigated.\nAn HR person joins us, via Zoom, to ensure my manager sticks to her script. She does so, and having read it to me, hands over my letter of suspension. Ten minutes later I’m out on the street having complied with instructions to hand in my laptop and lanyard, empty my locker, leave the building and cease all contact with colleagues until further notice.\nMy crime? I had recently posted, in a personal capacity, three tweets. Two were critical of the levels of immigration and the impact this was having on public services. One objected to the arrival in this country of what I feel to be that insane phenomenon targeted at young children, Drag Queen Story Time.\nThese tweets were neither hateful nor illegal. They didn’t advocate anything other than a review of current policy and practice. They simply expressed my personal opinion on matters that are of widespread and legitimate public concern.\nFor the next couple of months, I’m left to stew. It soon becomes apparent my unblemished eight-year work record counts for nothing, likewise the testimony of my manager and colleagues as to my good character. Eventually someone is hired to carry out an investigation.\nGiven my faultless work record, this hired offence archaeologist has only one job to do: take a deep dive into my rather shallow social media and wider internet presence in the hope of unearthing more of what these days passes for incriminating material. He will be disappointed, even by his standards.\nDespite this, when I am summoned to an online meeting with this man (and accompanying HR person), to me it’s obvious from their leading questions that minds have already been made up. I am – without a scintilla of evidence – to be found guilty of racism and homophobia, no less. This meeting is merely a formality. Resistance is futile. Injustice will be done.\nMy employer is a typically ultra-woke, inner-city local authority, so perhaps I was foolish not to see this coming. Yet still, the shock is profound, the sense of injustice intense.\nAnd sure enough, after a further delay, presumably to encourage my voluntary departure by resignation, I am informed of the investigation’s findings: there is a case to answer and so disciplinary proceedings will follow.\nIn an exchange of emails, it is now made clear to me – between the lines – that if I choose to resign immediately, a clean reference will be available. And if I don’t, it won’t be. This I take to be a threat wrapped in an inducement.\nWitch hunts have always gone on, the malicious few happy to instigate while others administer. But with every major institution in this country now captured, and the abject failure of the government to do anything about it, today’s cancel culture threatens freedom of speech and thought as never before in modern times. A cultural revolution has taken place, the speed and effectiveness of which would have amazed even Gramsci, the Marxist thinker who predicted it long ago.\nMind you, I doubt Gramsci foresaw the central role that HR departments would play in all this. Like red guards to the revolution, no one intent on staying inside the corporate tent these days, from chief executive down, dares question their spurious authority.\n‘Wrongthink’ and the curtailment of free speech, identity politics and the cult of anti-racism, transgender ideology and the undermining of women’s rights and children’s safety – we live and work under a rainbow of warped idealism.\nTrue, there are campaigning organisations, media channels, and an alternative commentariat challenging the current orthodoxy. But away from the limelight and the affirmation it grants, those with least agency are likely to remain at the mercy of this ‘culture’ for years to come: kids in bog standard schools and colleges, anonymous employees of innumerable bureaucracies and complacent corporate entities.\nHere wokery will linger, if only to avoid the embarrassment of its sudden disappearance. Remember, layers of management, still years from retirement, have built careers on the peddling of this stuff.\nConcessions won here and there are welcome but will not suffice. Call it a liberation from tyranny, call it simply a return to common sense. Either way, the necessary course-correction must be fundamental and all-encompassing. But from where will it come?\nNeither wing of the traditional political spectrum, nor the establishment centre show any signs of being able to dig us out of this hole. Short of a spiritual solution to the meaning crisis on whose barren ground these bad ideas grow, it is to the radical centre of British politics that we must look.\nEntirely in keeping with its underlying values and policy programme, the SDP is forthright on these issues: “A free and democratic society must hear different opinions in politeness and respect in order to thrive. We pledge to uphold the values of freedom of thought and speech which lie at the heart of British democracy”.\nWith a heavy heart, I resigned today. Realising my persecutors were intent on condemnation without even granting me the respect of a meeting in person – where they would have to look me, and, indeed, one another, in the eye – I declined the invitation to attend my disciplinary hearing via Zoom.\nNot even the accused of Salem knew that indignity.\nThis Country needs a Codified Written Constitution it will protect freedom of speech the United States and Germany have a 1st amendment however distasteful a person’s speech or views are\nI think you should have named names. Which inner city council is this? Who is the HR person involved? Who does she answer to? Who is the outside offence archeologist, and how much was he/she paid?\nThese people are tyrants, and they have no right to anonymity.\nThis woke PC culture imported from the United States to Britain must end perhaps the SDP should advocate as policy that the UK adopts a codified written constitution and become a Federal Republic of system like that of Germany the US Constitution protects freedom of speech however distasteful\nThis stuff comes from America, so a written constitution like theirs will not protect us.\nNor can we simply trumpet Freedom of Speech because they have already labelled that an extremist tool, a cover for “hate”. Freedom of Speech is sometimes used by people wishing to say dangerous and malicious things and this country has never accepted it should permit defamation, intimidation, or incitement to commit crime. Wokeism is promoted using Free Speech to deny it to others. What is “Drag Queen Story Time” if it isn’t a form of free expression, albeit an inappropriate one and arguably harmful to children’s understanding of themselves and the world. You see, you can’t champion absolute Free Speech and then censor things you think harmful. That would just be doing what the Wokeists do. You can’t achieve justice by reversing the direction of injustice, which is their basic mistake, if you think about it.\nRather, we needs laws which allow free discussion of ideas but require assertions to be supported by evidence (as defamation laws already do and if extended beyond defamation and prosecuted publicly rather than privately could also protect minorities from being falsely maligned, as well as preventing children or students being taught unproven hypotheses as facts), require criticism to be of ideas and not the people holding them (banning ad hominum attacks on reputations), ban intimidation in all its forms, but clarify what is and isn’t intimidation.\nThat would provide an environment where ideas can be discussed but misinformation cannot go unchallenged, where discussion is kept respectful, and where feelings cannot get in the way of facts, a rational society where truth matters more than one side’s wishful thinking.\nAs for HR, most of them, I would think, have simply swallowed what they’ve been told by the “experts” organisations have come to accept. Teaching them a better approach to equality and diversity which doesn’t involve allocating rights to specific groups and leaving everyone else out (I call my approach Diverse Diversity) might be the long-term goal there. We need to stop them thinking the worthy aims of Diversity or all-inclusiveness can be achieved through Identity Politics. There’s more to diversity than that.\nOh, and as for your own case, have you approached the Free Speech Union or similar bodies to see if they’ll take your case up, perhaps through an Industrial Tribunal? You might have been Constructively Dismissed.",

Formed in 2020, and comprised of SDP members under the age of 30, it is just like one of our many regional groups, except not attached to any part of Britain, instead acting as a community for the SDPs young members to come together.\nDedicated to the success of the SDP and seeing an SDP government one day, the YSD’s core aims are to promote the views of the SDPs younger members in shaping party strategy and policy, and to actively campaign for the support of other under 30s not currently in the SDP, at elections, youth political events and in university societies.\nThrough its website, social media, and supporting SDP campaigning across the UK, it aims to champion the core principles of Social Democracy and the SDP amongst Britain’s younger population and build a foundation for the SDP to compete against the establishment political parties for years to come.",

We will shelter British families from the economic and social pressures fracturing our society and seek to rebuild a prosperous and happier nation with policies that place the family at the heart of national life.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- The tax and benefit system will offer greater protection and support for family life. Couples raising children together (comprising a basic rate tax payer and a non tax payer) will benefit from full sharing of tax allowances.\n- The fundamental aim of national housing policy shall be to ensure that young people seeking to start a family and have children will be able to find a suitable, affordable home in which to do so.\n- Married families will be given preference in council house and social housing allocation, which will be increased. Safe, staffed accommodation will be provided by the state for vulnerable young unpartnered parents, including education, training support and parenting skills. Absent parents will pay child maintenance in all cases.\n- All parents of dependent children under school age may elect to work from home three days a week for at least two years, unless the nature of their work makes this impracticable.\n- When making staff redundancies, employers will be expected to take into account family circumstances, and parents supporting children under 16 will be accorded the same protection as groups presently protected under anti-discrimination legislation.\n- Parenting and household management skills will be made the centrepiece of the PHSE curriculum in all schools.\n- Government policy in all domains will be subject to the basic test as to whether it is supportive of the family as the fundamental foundation of society.\n- Government funding for women and men’s refuges shall be increased and a national helpline will be established to help tackle all forms of domestic abuse.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_we-need-to-talk-about-toleration/content_187.html": "A single atrocity in Minneapolis started a causal chain which has led to mass demonstrations, an orgy of rioting and looting across US cities and the vandalism of civic monuments across the world.\nAs the revolutionary agenda of Black Lives Matter (BLM) sweeps uncritically across our institutions it’s time to defend a vital, old-fashioned and neglected idea – civilised toleration.\nEquality is a noble aim but it remains a profound and stubborn truth that no diverse society will ever secure total parity among all groups and still remain free. All multiracial societies exhibit differences. Some of these differences should be challenged, some should be tolerated and some might even be celebrated. If a plurality of races and cultures are to coexist harmoniously in the same hosted space – while retaining their identities – an acceptance of some differences is essential. A civilised toleration of differences.\nAlas, the diversity enforcers disagree. They will find a disparity, quickly attribute it to racism or oppression and campaign for its immediate correction. Even better if the racism in question is considered ‘systemic’ or ‘institutional’. Much of their analysis is unthoughtful and infantile. Stuck in a victim versus oppressor mindset it doesn’t occur to them, for instance, that disparities in educational performance might reflect group differences, for instance, in the stability of family life or the tendency of parents to read to their children. An adult reaction to this reality might be to understand that variations in outcome could only be eliminated if the state could magically eradicate all these differences. This is not going to happen. Where disparities are to the advantage of favoured minorities however – Premier League footballers and jazz musicians come to my mind – there appears to be no problem.\nA programme of diversity training, racial quotas, Maoist ‘re-education’ programmes and pulling down statues is the opposite of toleration. A society which goes in for these things has lost the art of getting along with itself. It’s a place in which the useful ambiguity which is necessary for citizens to rub along together has evaporated.\nHistorically we know where this leads. Pogroms and racial violence have been the norm in many multi-ethnic states. Across history conspicuously successful minorities such as the Chinese in Malaysia, Asians in Uganda and, most tragically and persistently, Jews in Europe, have been persecuted. It’s unnerving to hear BLM activists openly advise people to make ordinary purchases based on race, a practice promoted by the Nazis in the 1930s.\nBeing a good citizen entails toleration and being a serious political party involves producing positive policy. This is an unhappy time and Social Democrats need to offer some solutions. Here are three.\nFirst, stop racialising everything. We aim for a more equal society but we accept that some differences are inevitable in a free society because practices and customs vary. A ‘colour-blind’ attitude is far better, wiser and more unifying than Labour and the far-right’s poisonous and divisive identity politics which, in reality, are gateways to actual racism. State-sanctioned racial favouritism is dangerous.\nSecondly, be truthful. Sensationalising things through simplistic slogans and depicting rare occurrences as typical of policing is highly irresponsible. It is harmful and anti-social. Tackling racial disparities in crime, education and employment requires honesty about the reasons for them as well as acceptance of the importance of social class. What happened in Minneapolis was terrible. However, it is inexcusable to exploit the incident to inflame and polarise here. Turn down the anger, turn up the facts.\nThirdly, deal with causes not symptoms. Many of the real reasons for group disparities concern culture, everyday practices, beliefs and social class. Working in grassroots sport will do more to help children become good citizens than political agitation. Good housing, education and sensible family policy will also do so.\nBritain had the good fortune of avoiding the European totalitarian scourges of the last century and there is no good reason for us to import racial conflict from the United States now. Whether we’ll enjoy a social future together or find ourselves locked behind gates is in the balance.\nPolitical wisdom will not be found in hyper-racialisation. It resides in recognising that we live in a sea of similarities and that, fundamentally, we want the same things. Getting them depends not on perpetual conflict but on the exact opposite – on achieving peace. Civilised toleration of differences isn’t, therefore, merely a social democratic ambition for a peaceful society, it is a pre-condition. It must prevail.\nHold onto toleration.\nI agree. The many privileges we enjoy in modern nations are due to our unique human capacity for specialisation in skills, teamwork for mutual benefit and fair free trade. And those good things can only happen where there is mutual regard, trust and toleration. Resentment, friction and disunity destroy peace and productivity. We seem to have lost sight of these basics. Yes, there is some largely class-based social injustice in the UK, itself a consequence of globalisation. But this ‘kill the bogeyman’ attitude is quite the wrong way to fix it.\nThank you for writing down so eloquently what I have been trying to convey in numerous conversations I have had recently.\nWell done SDP 🙂\nMe too!\nI’m sorry to admit I’d not really heard of the SDP prior to the last week.\nBut your articles came up in Google searches and were a wonderful breath of fresh air.\nWell written, thoughtful, rational and logical. Rather than the extreme emotion – mostly anger and hatred – I’ve seen in the press in general and especially the Woke left wing press.\nI hope the SDP can survive in the current climate of extreme intolerance.\nKeep up the good work!\nBrilliant\nThis narrative needs to be heard more loudly and clearly but the BBC and such like will do their damndest to suppress it\nThis is a great piece. Unfortunately, we live in a society where personal and communal responsibility for any group disparity is exported onto government. “Systemic” and “institutional” racism are purposefully vague, unsubstantiated terms to allow for the permanent perpetuation of racial grievances. Sadly, the culture war we find ourselves in offers few rewards to the honest and nuanced – characteristics sorely needed if inequalities are to be addressed.\nGood piece William. What I find the most disagreeable about BLM is that the narrative they use may have been more appropriate for the UK during the 1950’s rather than the 2020’s. The degree of institutional racism has been reduced to where it matters less than it did in the past. After all look at the Conservative cabinet and there is a good representation of BAME members. The same is true for all the professions ethnic diversity exists and to pretend it does not only perpetuates a false sense of victimhood.\nLove this – it’s exactly what I believe to be the way forward.\nI will join the SDP with enthusiastic optimism.\nI am a former Labour Party member.\nFirstly: Break the myth of White Privilege (indigenous child slavery, workhouses, average age for poor was 30 in 1800, working-class got the vote earlier based on WW1 – and even today the indigenous working-class are near the bottom for being accepted at elite universities.\nSecondly: Break the myths of SLAVERY – Several European ethnic groups enslaved the UK indigenous – Bristol was known for indigenous and Irish slavery. In Europe, the Arabs, Amazighs, Mongols, Persians, and Turks all enslaved Europeans (Slave markets even in the early twentieth century in Ottoman Turkey).\nTHEN take the ISLAMIST ANGLE OUT and UTILIZE… ARAB Muslims enslaved black Africans from the 7th century (800 years before Europeans) until 1962 when Saudi finally abolished slavery… THEN express how ISIS enslave the Yazidis today and Arabs are enslaving black Africans including branding in 2020.\nContinued: Marxism, communism, and racism – In Cuba the Afro-Cubans face enormous discrimination because from Castro onwards the leading figures are European descendants – Afro-Cubans suffer via economics and lack of political representation.\nChina and CCP: Racist ideology aimed at Tibetan Buddhists and Xinjiang Muslims – also the CCP is using Han nationalism to crush the minorities based on power concentration …\nHighlight how other communist societies including North Korea and Vietnam are nationalist….\nContinued: Highlight how black on black violence is responsible for untold numbers of deaths. In the UK, 85 percent of killings by the police are white (highlight their names)…Equally, show the irony that virtually no pogroms of black Africans exist in modern Europe – BUT ethnic massacres in Burkina Faso, DRC, Mali, Nigeria, South Sudan, and others are common – same applies to indigenous attacks in South Africa against immigrants … While in Uganda this country under Idi Amin kicked our all Asians and the UK took in…\nEqually, highlight how black African countries aren’t intent on Asian immigration – while most Asian nations don’t give citizenship to black Africans …. THEN highlight the mistreatment of black Africans in the Gulf and compare this with the openness of the UK.\nLastly: you need a committed group to utilize social media and show the enslavement of black Africans in Libya and the Gulf via video links – to utilize links from the media. Express indigenous poverty … and other areas mentioned. At all times RACIST COMMENTS must never happen and networking needs A BASE – but members also should remain hidden … Equally, focus on ALL PEOPLE who are proud of the civilization we support and this will bring in a cross section of ethnic groups and people from different classes – and ages.\nThank you for this interesting informative article William.\nWe don’t need Critical Race Theory in UK.\nI think I’m already a SDP member.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_a-sense-of-place-how-to-create-community-in-a-fractured-world/content_374.html": "Speech by William Clouston at the Battle of Ideas, 20th October 2024\nA few observations…\nThe disconnectedness, social isolation, loneliness that we’re experiencing is a worldwide phenomenon. Atomisation, for instance, is a major challenge for the Chinese Communist Party just as the epidemic of poor mental health is throughout the West. Deracination, semi-nomadic lives, dormitory towns and empty churches are all the products of modernity… or at least these are the destinations where the modern world had lead us. Material wealth combined with spiritual weakness.\nI don’t think human beings have changed so much as the conditions in which we find ourselves. What we’ve lost is a life in common. Of being together. A desire to be together still exists but it can be harder to fulfil.\nA few days ago I was in the Oxfam shop in Keswick. I saw a book which on its spine was ‘The Year Book for Scotland 1961. I picked it up and found it was the Conservative Party’s Year Book. There were 383 pages of directories of office holders, committees member contacts, honorary treasurers and voting records. They had 10 member committees for practically every electoral division in Scotland. The Conservative Party at that time had about 2.5 million members. Astonishing participation. Now long gone – today it’s a fraction of that.\nAs Ben Cobley recently wrote, the habits of participation, chairing meetings, minute taking now seem arcane and irrelevant to many. And so many of these little groups simply dissolve and melt away leaving a vaccum in the place. That vacuum is being filled with technology and, in particular, people gazing endlessly at screens. We have an epidemic of screen addiction. Smartphones intervene between people. Literally. Parallel lives at the same dinner table. And this addiction leads to cognitive deterioration, anxiety, depression, loss of sleep, loss of concentration.\nA quarter of 5-7 year olds now have smartphones. They are designed to be addictive. I think we should ban Smartphones for U16s.\nLet me suggest some solutions.\nFirst, place.\nQuote:\n‘For most people the meaning of their lives is a local affair’ John Gray.\nSolutions will almost always be local.\nThe Orcadian author Amy Liptrot wrote a book called The Outrun which has now been made into a film. One of Amy’s greatest insights was that when she was in her 20s in Hackney her friendship group was very narrow – people her age of similar outlook with similar habits. This is because it’s possible to convene and select a narrow friendship group in a large city. Amy moved to Papa Westray in Orkney – which has 90 people – and had to interact with people of different ages, backgrounds, outlook. Counterintuitively, social life in Hackney was insular. Social life in Orkney was varied. The solution will always depend, I think, on committing to being somewhere.\nSecondly, Communion. As a society I think we are doing as well can be expected to do for a culture which has shed its principal belief system. During the 2019 general election I was asked at the hustings at Leeds University how the SDP would solve a particular student’s anxiety and poor mental health. I talked about NHS policy. I should have asked whether the student had considered going to church. Why? Because going to church not just about belief its about belonging – being together – which is good spiritually – whether you believe or not. I don’t happen to believe, but I attend. Lord Home asked Harold MacMillan if he could put his finger on the point in time when the slide in values in Britain began to set in. His answer came without hesitation: The day when people stopped going to church on Sunday morning. Probably right.\nFinally, beneath the surface… there is a community to be convened.\nWhen the pandemic hit and lockdowns were imposed I help set up a volunteer network in my village in Northumberland to help people stuck at home – to run and get prescriptions, to buy food. I was inundated with offers of help. In fact, in each sector I had more volunteers than we could use. It exceeded our capacity to cope. So, in a crisis there was a massive urge to particpate.\nI think that showed a latent desire to participate underneath the surface.\nIt’s there – we need to find it and convene it.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_post-work/content_314.html": "Many decades ago world-shaping philosophers and economists pondered what the working world would be for future generations. Considering the gradual decline in working hours that was already then evident, many concluded that by, say, the early 21st century, we would be working even less.\nBack during the Great Depression, the economist John Maynard Keynes, for one, reckoned we’d all have a 15-hour working week by the end of this decade – the “age of leisure and abundance”, if you hadn’t noticed.\nFor these thinkers it very much looked to be, inevitably, the stuff of reality. And they were partly right: from 1800 to the 1970s, thanks to unionism and enlightened employers, working hours were gradually eroded until we arrived at the archetypal ’40 hour week’.\nAnd yet, somehow, this trajectory has not only stalled, but tech, corporate culture and an ‘always on’ mindset have extended working hours again for many, with job security and satisfaction, poll after poll suggests, having plummeted. Here we still are, talking of ‘downshifting’ and ‘work-life balance’, yet without the time to devote to our children, or caring for our elderly, or our hobbies, or just doing nothing.\n“What is needed,” the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote in ‘In Praise of Idleness’ in 1935, “is a new revolutionary movement, dedicated to the elimination of overwork and the reduction of work to a minimum.” What he could not have foreseen was that it might take a global pandemic to amplify the rebellion. Many people were forced to stop work, giving them the chance to take stock and assess why they felt so burned out.\n“The fact is that work is getting worse and worse for workers,” argues Elizabeth Anderson, professor or philosophy at the University of Michigan, author of the forthcoming ‘Hijacked: How Neo-Liberalism Turned the Work Ethic against Workers’. “Neo-liberalism, broadly, has seen corporations acquire the power to extract wealth from workers without adding value. And that’s turned into shareholder capitalism, in which the [key] purpose of a corporation is to dish out money to shareholders. Or a business model that’s all about building brands, and outsourcing all the actual work, which pushes workers to the periphery [of concerns]. In so much work now employees have just been made infinitely replaceable.”\nBut what if there was something that not long ago would have been considered heretical – a more conscious rejection of work? There is anarchistic talk of ‘anti-work’: a challenge to the economic order that underpins the workplace, that reframes work as fulfilling rather than as mere drudgery, that moves away from a system that sees us having to sell our labour just to survive.\nAfter all, as the late anthropologist David Graeber, noted, this system – in which the value of what is produced per hour worked is inexorably slowing – now appears to be shored up by so many of what he provocatively called “bullshit jobs”. The true function of these seems not to in any way contribute to society, or to the individual’s well-being, but rather merely to fill their time and keep them in their place.\n“Remember the ‘essential workers’ of the pandemic?” says Professor Kathi Weeks of Duke University, North Carolina, and author of ‘The Problem With Work’. “That’s an incredibly telling category, because most workers aren’t.”\nFor the less anarchistic there is talk of ‘post-work’: proposals, mostly from leading academics, to reconfigure our working lives so that we work, if not at all, then at least considerably less. “The pandemic has helped to clarify, magnify and publicise problems with work that are systematic,” argues Weeks. “It’s not just stagnant wages and bad bosses. It’s that people are underpaid relative to the value their create, subordinate to the demands of their employers and work in dramatically undemocratic workplaces. ‘Post’work’ isn’t about moving beyond all productive economic activity, but trying to imagine how we think work could be, about radical changes that would make work more humane.”\nSlowly, some governments are responding – last year the UAE, for example, made the bold decision to officially adopt the world’s first four-and-a-half day working week. A four day working week has likewise been trialled by companies in other parts of the world, from Chile to Denmark. Last year a pilot programme in the UK saw 61 employers – in manufacturing, software, recruitment and other sectors – adopt a four day working week for six months, with employees getting full pay for 80% of their normal hours. Remarkably, none reported a drop in productivity and some an actual increase.\nThere is now more vocal consideration of a universal basic income (UBI) too. Like minimal working hours, this isn’t a new idea – Thomas Paine proposed it back in 1797. It’s that a nation’s collective wealth, from both its natural resources and that passed down through the generations, should not land in the laps of the lucky few but is, in fact, the wealth of the commons and so should be rightfully distributed – by giving every citizen a regular payment that’s enough to cover basic living costs, allowing them to work more or less as they choose. UNESCO recently published a paper arguing that decades of evidence shows that UBIs – which it reframes as “unconditional national dividends” – simplified welfare systems, empowered women, and improved health, among other benefits.\nYet the UBI has been a divisive policy idea for years, often misrepresented as an ineffective way to alleviate poverty. And that’s a consequence of deep-seated ideas about work that will need to challenged before a post-work society might be achieved.\nRussell, again, argued that we’re stuck on the idea that work is some kind of moral good, that “work will make you better,” as he put it. “A great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the virtuousness of work”, underpinned as it is by religion and the pervasive Protestant work ethic. To this we can add what might be called the self-help/time management industrial complex and its insistence that we should feel guilty whenever we’re not being productive. Work is central to our politics, economics and social lives.\nNo wonder some might prefer the status quo: “Work is a faith many hold dear. It’s this modern religion [and] belief system that we go to in order to find our identity, our purpose, our meaning,” argues Benjamin Hunnicutt, professor of history at the University of Iowa, and author of ‘Free Time: The Forgotten American Dream’. “But it’s counter-balanced by the doubt that there’s anything else: without work what is there but a great vacuum? It’s been so long it’s hard to imagine a realistic moral alternative to work. So there’s a fear of leisure. Yet more free time was once equated with progress.”\n“The ideology of work is still just so strong. Work holds this cultural kudos: if you work you’re a ‘good citizen’, a ‘contributor to society’. But as the need to work becomes less it becomes dangerous for the ruling elites to insist on that idea, to up the ante on the moralism,” argues Cass Business School professor Peter Fleming, author of ‘The Death of Homo Economicus’. “Sometimes it seems [those in power] would rather keep the current system until it crashes and burns, rather than make changes. But clearly the narrative of work as we’ve known it is in big trouble.”\nPerhaps the first step is a more widespread awareness of the big trouble that work is in. Karl Marx outlined the fundamental contradiction of capitalism – that it could provide the organisation and production systems to abolish what he called “alienated” work, and give us all so much more free time, yet it clings to work as if it was the only possible organising principle both for society and people’s lives.\nMight now, asks Hunnicutt, more of us finally be coming to openly acknowledge, as an existential challenge, that much work is repetitive and boring? If, he says, a cashier’s job was a video game – find the barcode, scan, slide, repeat – it would be called mindless. Yet politicians still pitch such a job as intrinsic to that person’s dignity. Of course, there is that rough third of the working population said to love what they do. For the majority, polls suggest, those things we might hope for from a job – autonomy, fulfilment and so on – are sorely lacking.\n“The idea that work is a belief system to which we go in order to find our identity, our purpose, our meaning, is increasingly shaky,” says Hunnicutt, who, less than a decade ago, faced death threats in response to writing an article proposing the introduction of a UBI in the US. “People are beginning to lose faith, if you like. We’re thinking more of work as a means to an end, as we used to, rather than as an end in itself, and that’s especially true of younger generations.”\nIndeed, that work is an unalloyed good, in and of itself, is such a prevalent idea that those institutions that oppose the introduction of a UBI often do so on the judgement that it would only encourage people to slide into laziness and dissolution (while typically not seeing the lack of labour in the rich as similarly problematic). There’s a lack of trust that individuals can find the best way to spend their own time. There’s also the concern that a UBI would decrease economic participation – governments largely want us to keep spending, remember – even though evidence suggests it actually increases it.\nRussell reckoned that the most meaningful, and impactful, work one could choose to do comes from our leisure time – it’s in leisure that humans are the most prone to invention and creativity. The decline in paid work might spark a resurgence in both.\nYes, it’s hard to change an operating system. But imagine an alternative we must. And that, reckons Tom Juravich, professor of labour studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, will require big business to lead by example.\n“I don’t think policy people have understood how big this shift in thinking about work is yet and I don’t see effective change coming one small business at a time,” he argues. “What it will take are major employers – an Amazon, a Google – to make a bold experiment in changing working hours, and so far they seem to be doing very little to set new standards. We need these kinds of big businesses to question if we can re-work the rules so people can still be seen as good employees while working less, without them being expected to be ‘all in’ for the company. And that’s a big cultural shift.”\nBut one that may be coming, like it or not. Serious consideration of a world in which we all work much less may well be forced, argues independent future of work research organisation Autonomy, given both environmental challenges and an ageing population. And, what’s more, the exponentially rising capabilities of ever cheaper automation – from self-service checkouts to self-driving cars and drone deliveries – and artificial intelligence. New industries already here just don’t require human labour like they used to either.\n“That’s the elephant in the room for all of this discussion about moving to a post-work society,” says Peter Fleming. “The demand for labour just isn’t there anymore, which is why you see service workers needing two or three jobs to stay afloat. And a service economy just doesn’t make jobs as manufacturing once did. But nobody in power ever admits as much. Elections are all about job, jobs, jobs, not how we need to change our approach to work.”\nNo wonder there’s a glut of over-qualified, debt-burdened young workers using their degrees to wait tables and stack shelves. They must be wondering where the dream careers they were sold on went. And whether they, as the next generation, need to rethink the place of work in their lives at a more profound level.\nThe Social Democratic Party must make it a policy to ban Artificial intelligence completely or limitation of use politicians need to wake up about these issues\nThe trouble is, if we ban AI, the benefits will be lost, especially in medicine. Also, countries that aren’t exactly our closest allies will push ahead and become dominant in every field of activity. It’s an AI ‘arms race’ and democracies can’t afford to lose it.\nClever economists and politicians need to get together and develop a new economic model in which most people aren’t in paid employment. The timeline for doing this, according to Mo Gawdat (former Google CBO), is two to five years. So the clock is ticking.\nBy the way, this blog is excellent and it’s a pity that the other parties aren’t addressing the impact of AI in the same way.\nExcellent article. My own experience of work chimes well with this. My job satisfaction was severely reduced when my employers put me under increasing pressure to do what was already an interesting job, and in the end I took the courageous decision to leave. I never regretted leaving a job, but then I had the resources to survive, and others have not that luxury.\nWe work long hours and have low productivity, because tired workers can’t give their best. Our civic society suffers because people no longer have time for hobbies or interests. Volunteers used to be people with jobs giving their free time. Now they tend to be unemployed people trying to get experience to put on their CVs.\nBanning AI misses the point and just demonstrates the point made; that some can’t imagine a world not based on work. We need to control how AI is used to ensure people remain in charge, but we can’t be Luddites.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_orkney-communitarianism/content_26.html": "Surveys regularly rank the Orkney Islands as the happiest place in Britain.\nOn the surface, it’s easy to just attribute this to the archipelago’s good schools, affordable houses, clean air and abundance of space.\nHowever, Orkney’s real edge comes in the form of a robust communitarianism that instils a profound sense of safety and social trust among residents. It’s the sort of place where crime is rare, farm equipment is shared and where a builder’s yard won’t charge you for half a bag of sand.\nIf you want to see what a communitarian social model looks like, a trip to Orkney is a good idea.\nWhat’s the root of this communitarianism? You could start by looking at the part played its Norse heritage. Scotland acquired Orkney by accident in 1471; once a central hinge in the Nordic chain linking Scandinavia with Iceland and Greenland, it became a peripheral province of Scotland.\nEven today, some Orcadians talk about travelling to Scotland as if it were a separate country. The local language of Orkney Norn, similar to Icelandic and Faroese, was gradually replaced by Scots but survived on the outer islands until the late 1700s. The modern Orkney dialect has a noticeable ‘sing song’ Scandinavian quality, characterised by a rising intonation at the end of a word (known as ‘the post stressed syllable’).\nOrkney certainly enjoys a strong sense of local patriotism underpinned by its Norse identity, and a sense it possesses of separateness to the rest of Scotland. Orcadian poet Edwin Muir once infamously disparaged Scotland as ‘a sham nation’. George Mackay Brown drew deeply on Orkney’s Norse mythology.\nI’ve always found Oracadians somewhat conservative in the best sense of the word. In his ‘History of Orkney’ of the late 1700s George Low noted that Orcadians were reserved in their sentiments, honest in their dealings with one another but ‘studious to conceal their gains’, while also being tenacious in their preservation of old customs. A politeness and civility also seems to pervade the islands, which seems to be largely gone in other parts of the British hinterland.\nBy modern standards, Orkney remains basically monocultural. This can be an awkward conversation. The idea of a monoculture might seem impolite and déclassé in a society where diversity is now promoted as a foundational value. For progressives, monocultures are unacceptable, exclusionary things, in need of correction.\nHowever, the monocultural strength of Orcadian culture seems to make it easier for incomers to fit in. Unlike most of Britain, Orcadians set a cultural tone into which new arrivals can assimilate. These clearer rules and norms make it easier for outsiders to find a place in the community. It’s not uncommon for settlers from the south (called ‘Ferry-Loupers’) to give their Orkney-born children names like Erland, Thorfinn and Mangus.\nIn her 2016 book The Outrun, Amy Liptrot describes returning to Orkney after spending her twenties in London. She makes the acute and rather devastating observation that her social network in Orkney was more diverse than in London.\nThis sounds odd. I’ll explain. On the small island of Papa Westray (population 90), Liptrot had no option but to interact with her fellow islanders, since day-to-day life demanded it. She met and became friends with a wide range of people of different ages, political outlooks, habits, and backgrounds (the outer islands have a high proportion of ‘incomers’). In contrast, her London friendship group was narrowed to people of a similar age, viewpoints and habits. In a large city it’s possible, if you wish, to assemble friends only among those similar to yourself. Perhaps it’s a conceit that the urban are broad-minded and those in distant hinterlands are not.\nFamiliarity is ubiquitous. The scale of the place is such that, particularly on the outer islands, everyone knows each other. Of course, metropolitans accustomed to anonymity might view this as a version of hell. But to Orcadians, knowing everyone is just part of being rooted; part of being at home; part of being secure.\nOrcadians are used to enjoying their space, with 22,000 people occupying an area only around half the size of Greater London. The Orkney Islands Council’s historically generous attitude to sporadic house-building means that median house prices are an affordable £145,000, as opposed to the UK average of £248,000. This supports family life by helping people settle down. Until relatively recently, if a relative had a field in the right place you could expect to buy a kit-home and quickly become a homeowner.\nCrime is extremely low and in some remote parishes is virtually non-existent. Thirty years ago my parents bought a property overlooking Scapa Flow which, with a few short intermissions, had been owned by our wider family for generations. On requesting the door key the estate agent replied that it didn’t exist.\nThe role of Orcadian newspaper – a local institution and published since 1854 – in governing public morals should not be overlooked. If someone has a pub fight in Kirkwall they risk a walk of shame in The Orcadian’s Sheriff’s Court pages. It will eventually be forgotten, but a more serious crime will not. The lesson Orkney provides is that public morality presupposes a coherent public.\nThe Orkney microcosm offers much to learn. A strong social ‘mythos’ binds people into a common identity which fosters trust and togetherness. Assimilation among migrants is seen as an achievement and ostentation is frowned upon. Above all, there is a sense among Orcadians of being part of something bigger than themselves.\nOrcadian communitarianism was part of the worldview of the late Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond, who represented the division at Westminster from 1950 to 1983. Grimond reflected the Orcadian experience when he said:\n‘There is such a thing as society and it’s as necessary to the individual as water is to fish.’\nYour description of The Orkneys make them sound like Shangri-La when compared to overcrowded England.\nA really interesting article. There appears to be a great deal to envy and to follow. It would be interesting to see how the example of communitarianism from the Orkneys could be transposed onto the UK. I would certainly agree that monoculturalism should be encouraged. Multiculturalism has clearly not worked\nVery interesting account on community value.\nThe 2 concepts that are at the heart of this commentary are community and integration. Sadly, Thatcher’s oft misrepresented (but insensitively articulated) dictum that “there is no such thing as society” has come to pass yet “communities” of every sort (provided they are not white, middle-class or Christian) proliferate. These communities are exclusionary by nature as they are defined by what sets the membership apart. It is now orthodoxy that newcomers to our society need to change nothing about their traditions, beliefs or behaviour, it’s the indigenous population who must adapt to them and the notional communities they attach to. Hence, there is no imperative for integration or assimilation. The result of these dogmas is there for all to see!",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_in-good-health/content_14.html": "What needs to happen with the NHS? TONY EVANS takes to his podium and offers the kind of speech he’d like to hear about necessary reforms.\nThe Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has promised us a “10 Year Health Plan”, to be published in this spring. Wes Streeting has stated that it will “deliver the biggest reimagining of the NHS since its birth”. Meanwhile, in a parallel universe at the far side of the Galaxy, spring has already arrived, and the Health Plan has been unveiled by Streeting’s doppelganger in a speech to the nation. It goes something like this….\n“I am sure that you will have been waiting impatiently for the details of our 10 Year Health Plan. Let me first address those rumours regarding our consultations with the other political parties, both major and minor, in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They are correct: for some months representatives of all UK parties have been meeting in secret at Butlin’s Holiday Camp in Skegness, and have now approved an historic cross-party agreement to reform fundamentally the delivery of health care in the United Kingdom. The game-changing Camp Butlin Accord means that the radical proposals that I will outline today will not be vulnerable to cynical political points-scoring, and more importantly, will remain in place after the next election, whichever party – or coalition – is in power.\n“Previous attempts at fundamental reform have been hampered by the ability of the British public to hold two conflicting beliefs at the same time: a classic case of what Orwell termed ‘doublethink’. Firstly, that the NHS in its current incarnation is deeply dysfunctional – a belief supported by Lord Darzi’s recent report, as well as the experiences of many patients. Secondly, that the basic principles that have guided the NHS since its establishment in 1948 – including services largely free at the point of delivery, and primary care provided by family doctors in local GP practices – are sacred and inviolable, and have made the NHS the envy of the world.\n“The historic Camp Butlin Accord recognises that the NHS can only deliver the service that citizens need if these basic principles are challenged, further recognising that the structures established in 1948 are no longer suitable for the 21st century. I will now outline our forthcoming reforms in four key areas: funding; structures; workforce; and managing future demand.\n“Firstly, funding. ‘Free at the point of delivery’ has been, to date, a principle that until now no incumbent government that wished to remain in power could challenge. Under our Health Plan, we will retain the principle that all citizens should have access to vital health care, but the method of delivery will change. We will fund the NHS through an insurance scheme of the kind used successfully in most European countries. In our scheme, all adults will be required to pay into a public insurance fund, overseen and guaranteed by central government.\n“Compulsory deductions (taken from all state benefits as well as from wages) will be related to income, with higher earners paying more into the fund. Nominal up-front payments will be required to access NHS services: for example, £20 for an in-person appointment with a GP or senior health professional. These charges will be refundable via the health insurance scheme. Dentistry will be fully integrated into NHS services, and the current anomaly of separate charges for NHS dentistry will end.\n“Now, I am sure that many of you will be wondering: ‘Why not use income tax to fund the health service, increasing it to a level commensurate with the money that would be raised by the new insurance charges?’. My response is that an insurance scheme provides a very different psychological context. Increases in income tax rates or VAT are regarded by the public as an imposition by government, whatever nominal purpose is announced. Citizens feel ‘they are taking more of my money’ without any obvious benefit, and this depresses economic confidence and enterprise. In contrast, a payment into a public health insurance scheme is more likely to be seen in the same light as a mortgage repayment or a monthly car lease payment i.e. as a necessary outgoing which brings tangible benefits. Of course, in such a scheme, directly funded by citizens, the current level of dysfunction in the service cannot be tolerated. Citizens will expect to get what they pay for – just as they expect their leased car to be reliable.\n“The Camp Butlin plan to make a nominal charge for accessing health services may also be questioned – a common objection to this proposal is that the money used to administer this scheme would be wasted, as the charge is refunded. So why bother? Again, the answer lies in the psychology of the patient, and indeed of the healthcare workers with whom the patient interacts. ‘Free’ services tend to be both overused and undervalued. The (refundable) nominal charge of £20 to see a health professional will encourage citizens more readily to identify issues that are self-limiting, and which can be treated with over-the-counter remedies. The ‘free’ nature of the NHS also places the patient in the position of a charity-seeking supplicant when interacting with healthcare workers – a payment scheme will serve to remind everyone that the NHS exists only because patients are paying the wages of the staff.\n“Next I will turn to the structure of the health service. The 10 Year Health Plan will introduce a radical departure from the ‘family doctor’ model of primary health care which has – in theory, if not in practice – prevailed since the establishment of the NHS in 1948. An idealised version of this model is embedded in the British psyche: a world where dedicated, full-time GPs have worked for many years in the same surgery; pillars of their community who have built up an intimate knowledge of their patients, who will see urgent cases the same day, and are not averse to turning out at 3.00am to provide treatment, reassurance or an emergency referral to hospital…\n“It is not necessary to abolish this model, since it no longer exists – it has been replaced by, typically, a two week wait for an initial telephone appointment. Instead, we will establish Local Health Hubs, staffed by salaried doctors and a range of other health professionals, and open between 8.00am and 6.00pm seven days a week. Appointments will be available in advance, but patients will also be able to get advice on a ‘drop in’ basis. All patients will be seen in the first instance by the equivalent of an Advanced Nurse Practitioner who can prescribe medication if needed, and can refer on to a doctor if necessary. Most patients with mental health concerns or conditions will be directed to counselling services within the hub, rather than doctors. The current Accident and Emergency units attached to hospital will remain. However, people who attend them with a non-urgent condition will be re-directed to a Local Health Hub. The Health Hubs will also be the focus for integrated preventative care, delivered locally.\n“For secondary care, the main change in the plan will be the establishment of a network of Senior Care Hospitals (similar to the geriatric hospitals which used to be provided by the NHS). Some elderly people admitted to these hospitals will be awaiting admittance to a suitable residential care home where they can have assistance with day-to-day living; others will have chronic conditions which require long-term medical treatment.\n“Management of the NHS will be rationalised and streamlined. The Camp Butlin Accord includes an agreement that strategic management of health services will no longer be a delegated responsibility of the regional Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies: policy will be set and managed centrally by parliament, in order to ensure equal, best-practice treatment for all citizens of the UK.\n“The 10 Year Health Plan will involve also significant changes to the current terms and conditions of the healthcare workforce. The nation’s tax-payers can no longer afford the luxury of training a doctor or dentist who may then choose to leave the service or work part-time. Therefore, from 1st January 2026, entry to medical and dentistry training will be conditional upon applicants contracting to work full-time in the NHS, as salaried employees, for a period of ten years after qualification. Anyone breaking this contract will be required to repay the cost of their training – over £200,000 after tuition fees are taken into account.\n“New medical, dental and nursing schools will also be established so that all health workers can be recruited from UK nationals, rather than imported, and a non-graduate apprentice pathway will be restored to nurse training. We will ensure that enough dentists are trained to supply dental services to all who need them. More responsibilities will be given to other skilled staff in the workforce, such as those currently designated as Advanced Nurse Practitioners and Physician Associates. Staff at this level who are licenced to prescribe prescription medicines will be redesignated as Senior Medical Assistants.\n“Finally, this new health plan can only work if future demand for health services is controlled. Toleration of ever-increasing demand for NHS services will sabotage any attempts at reform. The Camp Butlin Accord recognises that there are two large elephants in the demand room. The first is social care, where the current inadequate provision traps patients in hospital. I am delighted to say that cross-party consensus is now close to being reached on the establishment of a national scheme (including the devolved UK governments) which will fund residential and at-home social care throughout the country. In conjunction with the establishment of Senior Care Hospitals, outlined above, this will ensure that hospital beds are occupied only by those who need them, allowing for timely admittance of new patients and an end to the scandal of ‘corridor care’.\n“The second demand elephant is the rapidly increasing population of the UK, wholly due to migration. Official government statistics state that in 2023 net migration was 782,000 (https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06077/). No service planning can cope with a continuation of this level of increased demand. The Prime Minister has agreed that I can reveal today that a further series of cross-party talks will soon be underway in Skegness to address the migration issue; all the participants have already approved an objective of reducing net migration to 50,000 per annum, which will provide the stability needed for long term health planning.\n“I would like to conclude this outline of the 10 Year Health Plan by summing up what I believe to be its two most important features. Firstly, and most importantly, it has been produced through political consensus. The days when the major parties could use each other’s proposals for cheap electoral advantage are over. Secondly, it should be obvious that the radical changes introduced will need to be implemented over the long-term.\n“Of course, when immediate action is needed to tackle an issue it will be taken, but the fundamental reforms I have here today outlined – for example, the changes to the contracts for doctors entering training – will take some years to show their effect. This should not be seen as a disadvantage: the plan is intended to put the health care of the United Kingdom back on a sound and sustainable footing for generations to come, an objective which deserves the time and effort needed to achieve it. But the Camp Butlin Accord will deliver….”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_a-wafer-thin-statement-2/content_35.html": "Jeremy Hunt’s Autumn Statement ignores Britain’s obvious longstanding problems. Rather than address them, he conjures up a phantom problem of his own making, which his proposals will probably make worse. It is failure on a grand and disgraceful scale.\nThe touchstone of his Autumn Statement is this: what is he trying to achieve, and how will we know whether he has achieved it? By extension, what is he prepared to sacrifice in his attempts to achieve his aims? What’s in, what’s out?\nThere is a list a mile long of what would be worth aiming at, and these are mainly the things which have been allowed to deteriorate by previous governments. They are a big part of why the country faces the current combination of recession, inflation and international financial scepticism. But none of the UK’s economic, financial and social problems can be solved if the economy isn’t growing.\nSo what is he about? In the beginning is the word, so here’s Hunt’s gospel, paragraph 1.1:\n1.1 Sustainable public finances provide the stability and confidence that underpin the economy, supporting businesses and households across the country. By taking the responsible decisions needed to achieve fiscal sustainability, the government is providing the necessary conditions for economic growth.\nQuestions needing answers are: by what measure are public finances judged sustainable/unsustainable? By what measure are decisions judged “responsible”?\nHe is very clear about his criteria for sustainability: public debt as a % of GDP should be falling. Without the measures he outlined, he warned, “underlying debt would have been rising by 1% of GDP in 2027-28”. Gosh, 1% of GDP over five years – call the fireman.\nThen he segues: “Ensuring that debt as a share of GDP falls over time allows the government to fund high quality public services while preserving its ability to support households and businesses in the face of economic shocks.”\nOver time, maybe this is arguable. But right now, does he not realize that he is the economic shock? And that in the meantime, with only a couple of exceptions, he is planning to cut spending on public services in nominal and real terms?\nBut how reasonable is this as a vision of sustainability anyway? Why choose now to decide to lower debt/GDP? He knows this is a problem, so advances various defensive arguments:\n“Several other countries have reaffirmed their commitment to return to fiscal discipline in the medium term, including reducing debt as a share of GDP,” he says…\nThe UK gets a recession roughly once every nine years, “and a typical recession could add an average of 10pps to the debt-to-GDP ratio,” Hunt explains. Well, I guess we’re going to test that one out right now…\nAn aging population poses challenges to the public finances that will materialize over the coming decades…\nReducing debt as a share of GDP will also help to reduce spending on debt interest, he argues. A one percentage point increase in gilt rates could raise debt interest spending by £9.5 billion in 2026-27, compared to £6.0 billion in March 2022. Similarly, a £10.0 billion annual increase in the government’s cash requirement could mean debt interest spending rises by £1.6 billion by the end of the forecast…\nBut what we have here are not arguments for sustainability, rather simply for lower government debt/GDP, right now. That’s even though doing so will be vigorously pro-cyclical at a time when he knows we’re headed into recession.\nGranted, he sounds superficially plausible, because it is self-evident that at some stage some level of public debt must eventually turn out to be “unsustainable”. Yes, but that is like saying that if you keep eating too much then eventually, like M. Creosote, you will burst. That is not an argument for skipping breakfast. You might need breakfast to get you through the day.\nSo let us consider whether we are turning into M. Creosote. For this I turn to the ONS’s update on UK general government debt, published in June this year. This reveals two things. First, general government debt is already falling as a % of GDP. Let me repeat that for Mr Hunt: falling.\nSecond, even today, with debt at 105.6% of GDP, UK’s general government debt was 29.1 percentage points lower than the G7 average.\nIn other words, the current debt and fiscal reality is that we are among the last country in the developed world to face M. Creosote’s fate.\nThen there’s the matter of timing. Hunt says the Autumn Statement policy decisions begin to reduce borrowing from 2024-25, “when the economy is in recovery and unemployment begins to fall”.\nBut that’s not an economic forecast the Bank of England recognizes, even before Hunt’s fiscal squeeze gets its grip. Its central forecast, before Hunt’s pro-cyclical fiscal squeeze, is for the economy still to be in recession in FY24/25. The Bank of England expects unemployment to be still rising in in FY24/25, and in FY25/26 as well.\nHappily for the Chancellor, however, the OBR has discovered itself to be much more cheerful than the Bank of England, expecting a recession of 1.4% in 2023 to be rapidly reversed by 1.3% growth in 2024, with growth doubling to 2025 in 2025, based on surging business investment and a sharp recovery in Britain’s trade balance. Happily, it also sees unemployment rate peaking at 4.9% in 2024 and to be in steady retreat in 2025, backed by a sustained recovery in productivity growth.\nHunt needs the OBR’s optimism to be better founded than the Bank of England’s dour outlook. It’s not clear at all that this will be the case.\nAll the same, right here, before we consider the scope and variety of Hunt’s inflictions, we are in a position to make three assertions:\nFirst, by international comparisons, our fiscal and debt position are relatively favourable, and in no danger of proving “unsustainable” in the short to medium or even visible-long term.\nSecond, even by Hunt’s proclaimed rules, general government debt is already falling as a percentage of GDP – the metric it appears He worships above all. We’re already doing it!\nThird, Hunt is assuming a more favourable medium-term economic outlook, and earlier recovery, than the Bank of England at least expects. And that’s before he gets around to cutting spending and raise taxation.\nSo much for the Chancellor’s general argument. Now let’s look at the overall totals for tax and spending, and the priorities revealed by them.\nHere he is quite canny: during 2023/24, excluding the £12.78bn spent on the Energy Price Guarantee, net government spending is to rise by £2.03bn, with taxes rising £7.41bn and spending to rise £9.45bn. The squeeze really starts the following year (2024/25), coming in at a £10.2bn net squeeze, with the Energy Price Guarantee ending, taxes rising £14.7bn, and total spending rising only £4.7bn.\nThe net squeeze more than doubles to £24.77bn in 2025.26, rising again to £41.4bn in 2026/27 and £54.91bn in 2026/27.\nQuite how this longer-term squeeze will really be achieved remains mysterious. However, the priorities in the short to medium term are easily judged by looking at the targets for spending (Department Expenditure Limits). Overall, his plan is to budget for nominal spending ex-depreciation, with allowance for shortfall, of just 0.6% in 2023/24 falling to 0.5% in 2024/25. If double-digit inflation isn’t going to collapse into dramatic deflation, this means in real terms overall spending is being cut dramatically.\nTaking in the broadest view of government spending, including capital spending, the plan is for it to rise 1.4% in 2023/24 (47.2% of GDP) and then to fall 1.5% in 2024/25 (44.9% of GDP). But who wins, and who loses, over that timeframe?\nHealth & Social Care, up 4.8%, then 2.4%, with NHS up 5.1% then 3.4%\nEducation: up 5.3%, then 1.7%\nHome Office: up 5.5%, then 0.7%\nScotland: up up 3.4%, then 1.1%\nGood for them. But every other department is looking down the barrel of straightforward cuts in nominal budget: Defence; Single Intelligence Account; Foreign, Commonwealth & Dev Office; DLUH Levelling Up; Housing and Communities; Transport; Digital/Culture/Media/Sport; Environment Food & Rural; Int’l Trade; Work & Pensions; HM Revenue and Customs; Treasury; and the Cabinet Office.\nIt all adds up to a narrowly restricted set of aims: health and education, the police, and Scotland are the priorities to retain a reduced level of protective government interest. Any other priority is abandoned. And none of Britain’s long-standing problems are addressed or solved.\nBut at least we’ll be sustainable in our poverty.\nHunt was a disaster as Health Secretary in the ConDem Coalition of 2010 to 2015 how on earth has Sunak appointed this odious Covid Authoritarian as Chancellor, with luck the Conservative Backbenchers and the British public may get angered enough to force Sunak to remove Hunt before He causes Serious economic and political unrest in this Country not seen since the poll tax riots of the late 1980’s which caused Thatcher’s demise this Country is crying out for real change that’s not being offered by Sunak, Starmer and Davey the SDP must be that alternative to the Tories and Labour\nSDP be that alternative to the Tories and Labour the UK can’t go on with this austerity and reckless Governance that this So-called Government and the tame compliant opposition have done for the last 40 Year’s\nHunt has no mandate to inflict this austerity measures on a increasingly angry British public caused by a inept administration who’s handled Covid19 disastrously and a opposition who’s leader is basically a Red Tory",

H. Tawney\nCONTENTS\nThe Social Democratic Party offers its warmest thanks to all of those who assisted in policy work for our 2024 General Election Manifesto.\nIn particular. we’d like to thank SDP Head of Policy Ross Baglin together with Jake Painter, Dr Paula Lightfoot, Michael Taylor, Matthew Kirtley, Will Beaufoy, Rupert Cheetham, Sasha Watson, Maxwell Patterson, Kathy Bushell and Keenan Clough.\nFOREWORD\nHomecoming\nWe are proud to call ourselves Social Democrats and present a manifesto grounded in the realms which unite us – family, neighbourhood and nation.\n‘If only there were an alternative…’ is so often the cry from citizens let down by governments too weak to protect them, too shy to defend our interests and too addicted to the short-term fix to plan for our future. A restoration is required and is offered here. A constant theme of SDP thinking is that most of our difficulties have cultural roots – indifference, complacency and lack of confidence. In truth, if nothing can be done about cultural causes then nothing can be done about anything else.\nThe remedies are available but require courage and determination. We can build houses, invest in industry, procure nuclear power stations and defend our national borders – if we elect people who want to do so.\nBritain is our home – not a shop or a charity. A civilised people feel the need to belong somewhere. We urge you to entrust our nation’s governance to the Social Democrats who will protect it, cherish it and restore our homeland to prosperity.\nWilliam Clouston\nParty Leader\nSocial Democratic Party\nCONSTITUTION\nReform of Britain’s constitution and political system is long overdue. The two-party duopoly – locked in by the first past the post voting system – is harming our nation, stifling political competition and denying new entrants a chance to contribute. Meanwhile, England – the United Kingdom’s largest nation – lacks the democratic voice granted to all others. The House of Lords remains an unreformed chamber of political appointees and the nation remains fettered by outdated post-war international protocols. We will be at the forefront of reinvigorating democratic politics and national sovereignty.\n- An English Parliament will be established outside London and bids to host it will be invited from cities in the Midlands and the North. The devolved parliaments of England, Wales and Scotland will have powers equivalent to, but not greater than, those of the current Scottish Parliament.\n- Westminster parliamentary elections will be conducted under a system of proportional representation comprising multi-member geographically based constituencies using the D’Hondt voting method.\n- The Human Rights Act will be replaced by a new Bill of Rights drawing upon the British tradition of liberty, free speech and free association and incorporating established principles such as habeas corpus and the rule of law. The Supreme Court will be abolished and the Law Lords reintroduced.\n- The House of Lords will be reformed. Hereditary Peers and the Lords Spiritual will be removed and the system of political honours abolished. A new independent nominations commission will appoint a house of 400 peers to serve for a maximum of 15 years with selection criteria to include political balance, competence and capacity to function in a revising upper chamber.\n- We will withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Council of Europe, the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and all other international instruments which deny UK sovereignty.\n- Political and economic power shall be further decentralised via existing devolved regional bodies and the creation of additional such entities within geographically and culturally coherent areas. Local authorities shall be granted greater autonomy including tax raising powers.\nGOVERNMENT REFORM\nWe are determined to deliver public services that British people can be proud of – offering excellent service and good value for money. By refocusing government on core delivery, we will create a public sector that proudly embraces productivity, automation and a culture of service. Integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality are the key values necessary to achieve this aspiration.\n- The Nolan Principles of integrity, honesty, objectivity, and impartiality will be upheld throughout government and public sector organisations. Government funding will be withdrawn from any body failing to do so.\n- All specialist ‘Equity, Diversity and Inclusion’ roles throughout the public sector will be abolished.\n- Public sector organisations will select on merit, and strive to attract the best available talent regardless of identity, place of birth, or upbringing.\n- We will conduct a zero-based efficiency review of all public and government bodies, including quangos. The key test will be whether taxpayers would willingly pay for the service provided and if not, activities will no longer be funded.\n- Each government department will produce a 5-year productivity plan, assessing priorities for more efficient service delivery, value for money, and workforce morale.\n- Taxpayers will be surveyed to test priorities for each department. Relevant performance metrics will be set and reported upon quarterly. Senior civil servants whose departments do not deliver on these plans within a reasonable time frame will be replaced.\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\nOur quality of life partly depends on the quality of local government but this vital sector has lost its way. Our Town and City Halls have become mere agents for Whitehall with much service provision farmed out to private contractors. Key municipal decisions are increasingly out-sourced to consultants which weakens democratic responsibility. The local state must rediscover confidence in its own capacity for the direct, economical provision of services and, in doing so, re-connect with local voters.\n- The existing structure of local government will be maintained. However, Parish and Community Councils will have an enhanced role, particularly in the creation and maintenance of streetscape, parks and the public realm.\n- Local authorities will strengthen and increase their capacity for the direct provision of core public services.\n- An independent national audit will benchmark council performance against basic metrics – rubbish collection, streetscape, road maintenance, overheads vs direct service personnel etc – one month before council elections. This will be sent to all households.\n- No head of local government will be paid a higher salary than the Prime Minister.\n- Police and crime commissioners will be abolished. The oversight of policing will be the responsibility of police authorities comprising elected members from local government together with co-opted members from police unions, public interest groups, the NHS and the fire service.\n- Local councils will be forbidden to make financial investments or speculations not directly related to service provision.\n- A National Corruption Office will be established with full investigatory and prosecuting powers to deal with public allegations of fraud and corruption in local government.\nGOVERNANCE OF NATIONAL ENTERPRISES\nNatural monopolies will be brought under government ownership and operated on commercial principles aligned with the service ethic. It is vital that all nationalised enterprises embody an ethos of duty to the nation and service to the citizen. We must learn the lessons of the 1970s, and ensure that these do not become insulated and uncompetitive entities managed more in the interests of management and employees than the British people.\n- An audit of key operational and strategic metrics against British and international comparators will be conducted every three years by an independent review body.\n- A business plan will be prepared annually by management and agreed by the relevant government department and Treasury officials.\n- At least three quarters of the board members of a national enterprise will have significant experience in the industry concerned. No board member may serve for more than 7 years, have any financial interest in a commercial enterprise connected with the national enterprise or be a former minister.\n- All executive appointments will be made by a committee of the Board and a Secretary of State for the area concerned.\n- The Chief Executive of the national enterprise will be paid at global market rates with at least 50% of remuneration being contingent upon performance targets including customer satisfaction, project delivery and cost/efficiency benchmarks.\n- National enterprises will fund their own capital investment from operating cash flow or via loans from the Treasury at the government borrowing rate + 1%.\n- Employment terms and conditions (including pay, pensions, and employment security) in nationalised industries will be benchmarked to comparable roles in the private sector. This benchmark will be reviewed regularly by an ombudsman, and all employees will be appraised annually against high standards of customer service. Non-performing employees will be dismissed.\nSCOTTISH REFERENDUM\nThe constant separatist focus on independence, and a general apathy towards Scottish politics from the national parties has left the Scottish people poorly represented and Scotland poorly governed. Scotland needs a government in Holyrood that prioritises Scots ahead of independence and focuses on improving lives using the devolved powers.\n- We believe Scotland is stronger and safer for its place within the family of nations that is the UK and reject calls for independence. We propose a brighter future for Scotland, as a leading nation within a democratically reformed UK that better represents all British people.\n- We do not believe a mandate for an independence referendum can be gained at a devolved election. Claiming such a mandate undermines the devolution settlement as these powers are reserved to Westminster.\n- Removing the threat of a second independence referendum for at least the term of the current Westminster parliament would give Scotland a period of much needed stability.\n- We will actively oppose and abstain from any unofficial referendum.\nSOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY\nOpen, competitive, free markets are the best and most efficient system for providing general goods and services. At the same time, successful nations depend on a strong and capable state to provide fundamentals such as the rule of law, public order, energy supply, transportation, education, and to ensure that free markets function properly and do not descend into cartels or monopolies. The public and private sectors are complementary parts of our society and should not be regarded as opponents. This is the SDP’s distinct Social Market position.\n- Natural monopolies such as railways, water, gas transportation and electricity distribution will be returned to public ownership. Capital will be raised for this via a British sovereign wealth fund and new bond issuance. Investors will be compensated at fair value. Productivity and customer service incentives will be applied across these enterprises.\n- We will establish a state-run National Development Bank (NDB). It will give all UK citizens and businesses a right to basic bank account with guaranteed deposits, fair returns on savings and a no-frills ultra-low-cost superannuation and investment service. It will also lend to large UK infrastructure projects and a portfolio of UK start-up businesses in key strategic sectors. NDB profits will be returned to the Treasury.\n- We will pursue an active industrial policy centred on productivity and investment and provide a long-term planning framework for the skills, technologies, energy resources and transport infrastructure required for economic growth.\n- We will specifically target an increase in manufacturing as a proportion of GDP, a reduction in the UK’s trade deficit and new industrial development in the UK regions.\n- We will target further increases in the National Living Wage so that it exceeds the OECD definition of low pay (two thirds of median income) within a single parliamentary cycle.\n- We shall maintain public expenditure at the affordable level of approximately 40% of GDP, investing strategically across the cycle in frontline public services. We shall avoid unsustainable increases above this level and target a reduction in government debt as a percentage of GDP across the business cycle.\nINDUSTRY\nAn active industrial policy will help us transfer our nation’s flair for research and technical innovation directly into industrial manufacturing. This will create competitive advantage for Britain, help reduce regional inequality, tackle our chronic trade deficits and increase the national wealth in the long-term. Decades of indifference to UK industry has resulted in failure. This ideological approach is coming to an end – and not before time.\n- A national industrial strategy will be produced aimed at re-industrialisation, skills training, the reduction of regional inequalities, supply chain resilience, the creation of high quality jobs and the elimination of the UK’s trade deficit.\n- A British Development Board (BDB) will be established and empowered to invest £10 billion per annum via equity investment in start-up manufacturing via a network of Regional Development Boards (RDBs). Each RDB will operate from the region’s key universities and will be responsible for the transmission of research and innovation into investment and industrial production.\n- Specific focus will be given to electric vehicle and gigafactory capacity, modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen, solar and wind farm manufacturing, mineral fuel production, electrical machinery and plastics.\n- A ‘Buy British’ bill will require government bodies to procure from domestic producers to strengthen industrial production. All large public infrastructure projects will be required to demonstrate the facilitation of domestic industrial capacity.\n- A Critical Minerals Supply Act will be passed to bolster our domestic extraction and supply of critical metals and minerals essential to the UK’s manufacturing and energy sector.\n- The creation of Works Councils to give workers a stronger voice in the workplace will be supported where employees demand it. Such Works Councils will have rights to co-determination, negotiation on behalf of employees, and to be consulted on major company decisions.\n- Corporation tax and non-domestic rates relief will be available to businesses establishing manufacturing in economically-deprived areas and training the local workforce. Tax policy will incentivise industrial research to enhance the existing research and development tax credit system.\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\nSince the natural resources and endowments of countries differ, international trade is an indispensable means of securing substantial net gains to human welfare. However, successive governments have been blind to the economic harm of running large persistent trade deficits. The habit of importing far more than we export is a form of short-term gratification. It prioritises consumption over production, gradually drains our wealth and leaves a legacy of industrial decay and debt. We must reset the trade balance – Britain’s future depends on it.\n- The central structural target of trade policy shall be a reduction in the UK’s trade deficit. Progress and policies against this target will be assessed and adjusted annually.\n- The UK will continue to participate in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and will respect state aid provisions within the Northern Ireland Protocol as well as the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.\n- The UK will pursue bilateral trade deals when in the national interest. Trade and industrial policy will support domestic resilience to minimise over-reliance on extended global supply lines and products from hostile regimes and to promote environmental sustainability.\n- Trade protection for the UK’s strategic industries will be legally but firmly applied under Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. Trade and tariff policy will also be used to protect companies in strategically important sectors and to support companies in emerging sectors and technologies.\n- Unfair trade – involving imports made with slave or sweatshop labour or that which disregards animal welfare or environmental standards – will be subject to unilateral sanction via import tariffs, quotas or outright bans.\n- Tax-advantaged Free Ports will be established with a focus on manufacture for export. As with Special Economic Zones (SEZs), these will be allowed only if local democratic support is secured.\nTAXATION\nA substantial tax base is the foundation of a strong and capable state. Taxation should be as simple and understandable as possible, easy to collect and hard to avoid. However, state expenditure should broadly match tax and other revenues across the economic cycle, with borrowing used only to fund investment anticipated to yield value greater than its cost. The secular growth in government debt as a percentage of GDP will be reversed via a combination of adequate taxes raised and general prudence in state expenditure.\n- The new OECD regime ensuring minimum rates of taxation on large global enterprises, which came into effect in January 2024, will be implemented as a priority.\n- Until the above OECD global accord comes into full effect, companies with a global turnover of greater than £10m and operating in the UK will pay a Turnover Tax proportionate to UK sales (calculated as 20% of the company’s declared global EBIT profit).\n- The annual allowance will be restored at all income levels, the non-domicile rule will be abolished and the corporate tax rate for SMEs will be cut to 15%. Stamp duty will be abolished on all residential land transfers below £500k, but applied at 10% on any portion above that level.\n- Any residential property unoccupied for more than 183 days per annum will be subject to a vacant residential property tax levied at 1% of the property’s capital value, with all revenues from this levy flowing to the local council.\n- Where a bequest is left to a direct family member, inheritance tax thresholds will be applied to each beneficiary of the estate, not the estate overall. Each child may therefore inherit £325,000 tax free. Spousal legacies will continue to be free of inheritance tax.\n- A tax of 2% will be levied on all online purchases and the proceeds used to fund civic improvement in town centres across the UK.\n- Pension contributions will be deductible at the basic rate of tax, not higher rates of tax as at present.\nTRANSPORT\nGovernment must provide the infrastructure for the timely, safe and efficient transportation of people and goods throughout our nation. Sadly, the neglect of our transport framework has resulted in delays, frustration and lost opportunities. Our railway system has been carved up, buses starved of funds and our roads left to deteriorate. Investment, planning and integration is required to provide a system which fully serves the citizen.\n- Our railway system will be nationalised. Rail operator franchises will be taken back into public ownership as they fall due via a re-established British Railways.\n- British Railways will be a comprehensive, fully integrated system encompassing the ownership of track and infrastructure, rolling stock, stations and ticketing. The Minister for Rail will be responsible and accountable for making the newly nationalised system work for the public.\n- We will favour bids by UK owned and based qualified manufacturers for new contracts to supply locomotives and rolling stock, including sub-systems and components. A rolling long term programme of train-line electrification will be established.\n- We will use funds saved by the scaling back of HS2 to create a Great Northern Railway Network, better linking up the towns and cities of the North of England to unleash their joint potential. We will seek to reopen at least 10 closed railway stations annually in growth corridors.\n- Funding for bus travel will be increased to enable fare reductions, higher frequency, increased security, new bus lanes, integration with other modes of transport and the protection of essential rural routes.\n- Contactless payment will be rolled out UK wide for all public transport but the ability to pay for public transport travel cards in cash will be maintained.\n- We will invest in renewal, improvement and maintenance of the road network, introducing national regulations for major schemes to require works to be completed in compressed timeframes, avoiding extended periods of restricted traffic flow unless approved by the relevant Minister. All nationally awarded contracts will include penalties for delays.\n- We will oppose new low-emission zones unless they have the clear public support of the local community. We will continue to build dedicated cycle lanes, but will not hive space off crowded roads to do so.\n- A licence test to ride an e-scooter will be required unless the rider already holds a full driver’s licence. All e-scooters and e-bikes will be speed limited with stiff penalties for overriding speed limits or riding in pedestrian-only spaces.\n- A landing fee tax will be introduced for private jet flights in the UK.\nENERGY & UTILITIES\nEnergy policy must provide reliable, efficient and environmentally-responsible energy to our citizens and build the foundations for industrial development and renewal. We will return natural monopolies and utilities to public ownership and build capability to manufacture and maintain our own infrastructure.\n- The contribution of nuclear energy to Britain’s electricity mix will be increased from 12% to 40% by 2035. We will renew our existing nuclear plants and develop new large-scale Generation IV reactors and small modular reactors. Planning rules for the approval of new nuclear facilities will be streamlined.\n- We will re-nationalise power supply and distribution via a new body, ‘British Energy’ which will also be responsible for implementing the UK’s energy strategy, and the underwriting and construction of new power generation plants and infrastructure.\n- We accept the broad scientific consensus that fossil fuels are contributing to climate change and that we need to reduce our aggregate usage of them; however, we do not support unrealistic objectives such as “Net Zero” which lead to an unbalanced and costly energy regime in the UK without materially impacting global warming.\n- British Energy will develop a regulatory framework to support UK gas fracking and carbon capture and storage subject to adequate environmental assessments, and for so long as natural gas remains a necessary part of our energy fuel mix. North Sea oil and gas exploration will be given a stable taxation regime to encourage investment and new permits for exploration and production will be expedited.\n- An energy security programme will be developed to ensure that the UK has energy resources in place to guarantee 12 months’ reserve supply. This will include the use of all domestic energy resources, from renewables through to traditional sources.\n- Expenditure on heat pumps, insulation, household solar panel systems and double/triple glazing by registered suppliers will be tax deductible at the basic rate.\n- Research into battery technology, hydrogen, nuclear energy, tidal, and low-energy transport will be supported by £4 billion of additional funding.\n- Water supply and management is a natural monopoly and it should be returned to public ownership. This will be financed via a British Sovereign Wealth Fund and new bond issuance. We will set capital investment targets to reduce and prevent future discharges. Consumer charges/incentives for conservation and dividends to shareholders in private water companies (where applicable) will be aligned with this goal.\nFAMILY\nGovernment must defend and support traditional family life whenever possible, particularly in welfare and economic policy, education and housing. We will shelter British families from the economic and social pressures fracturing our society and seek to rebuild a prosperous and happier nation with policies that place the family at the heart of national life.\n- The tax and benefit system will offer greater protection and support for family life. Couples raising children together (comprising a basic rate tax payer and a non tax payer) will benefit from full sharing of tax allowances.\n- The fundamental aim of national housing policy shall be to ensure that young people seeking to start a family will be able to find a suitable, affordable home in which to do so.\n- Married families will be given preference in council house and social housing allocation, which will be increased. Safe, staffed accommodation will be provided by the state for vulnerable young unpartnered parents, including education, training support and parenting skills. Absent parents will pay child maintenance in all cases.\n- All parents of dependent children under school age may elect to work from home three days a week for at least two years, unless the nature of their work makes this impracticable.\n- When making staff redundancies, employers will be expected to take into account family circumstances, and parents supporting children under 16 will be accorded the same protection as groups presently protected under anti-discrimination legislation.\n- Parenting and household management skills will be made the centrepiece of the Wellness (formerly PSHE: Personal, Social, Health and Economic) curriculum in all schools.\n- Government policy in all domains will be subject to the basic test as to whether it is supportive of the family as the foundation of society.\n- Government funding for women’s and men’s refuges shall be increased and a national helpline will be established to help tackle all forms of domestic abuse.\nHOUSING\nThe aim of housing policy is to make available a decent, affordable home for every citizen but no recent government has come close to securing this. Instead, the deliberate destruction of state housebuilding capacity together with mass immigration has created a perfect storm which denies millions a viable route to start a family and unfairly dashes young peoples’ dreams of a home of their own. We believe in urgently reversing this trend by reinvigorating state housebuilding and removing market distortions which prevent housing supply meeting demand.\n- We will establish a British Housing Corporation (BHC) to oversee and fund the construction of 100,000 social homes per year. In England, the BHC’s mandate will be implemented by newly established County Housing Corporations (CHCs) and in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland by the devolved governments.\n- CHCs will have powers to make Compulsory Purchase Orders to acquire necessary land and the ability to grant planning permission for their developments. They will take ownership of all social housing stock currently administered by local authorities. After a transitory moratorium to allow social housing stock to be replenished, we will re-introduce Right to Buy with the proviso that sold property must be replaced one-for-one by CHCs using the receipts of sale.\n- The BHC will establish skills colleges to rapidly scale Britain’s construction workforce, and the ability to invest in the development of new technologies to help improve productivity.\n- Private housing developers will be levied a 50% tax on the uplift to land value attributable to the granting of planning permission on all greenfield sites and undeveloped land.\n- We will apply a moratorium on buy-to-let mortgages with the aim of re-balancing the housing market towards the interests of young people and owner-occupiers.\n- We will bring forward legislation to increase security of tenure and to encourage longer term tenancies in the private rented sector.\n- All residential let property will require a ‘Conditions Certificate’ (a housing ‘MOT’) issued by a new Housing Standards Inspectorate. It will be illegal to collect rent on any home that has failed to obtain its Conditions Certificate – for example, for poor standards of property maintenance – for the full period that it has no Conditions Certificate.\n- Married British families will be given preference in social housing allocation and the housing needs of military veterans will be prioritised.\nHEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE\nThe principle that all citizens should have access to vital health care is sacrosanct to us. The method of delivery is not. The NHS requires substantial reform. It is over-managed and yet underperforms and the escalating costs of medical technology, an ageing population together with widespread lifestyle diseases will place huge future burdens on the service. The NHS must concentrate on its core function of treating the seriously ill and must properly plan its workforce requirements. Social care must be provided on a universal basis to end the geographical lottery in provision.\n- The NHS will train British citizens to fully satisfy its workforce requirements and end the practice of large-scale importation of doctors, nurses and other clinicians from developing countries. Specialist clinical universities will be established to achieve this.\n- A National Care Service (NCS) shall be established which will organise, implement and fund social care throughout the country to provide a good quality, comprehensive service.\n- Special measures will be applied to GP surgeries whose waiting times are in the bottom decile.\n- NHS England will publish a plan annually describing resource requirements to reduce waiting times for elective surgery to 6 weeks, and waiting times at A&E to under 3 hours.\n- A public volunteer service for aged care will be established. Those over 65 who volunteer for front line roles in the public aged care sector will receive credits toward the costs of their own aged care, at the rate of £10,000 for each year of full-time service. In effect, this will reduce the upper limit on costs a person can be asked to pay toward his or her social care under the October 2023 cap.\n- A national audit of the NHS will be undertaken and published, benchmarking its performance and costs against health care systems in other comparable nations, and issuing a headline report to all NI-eligible citizens.\n- NHS management and overhead functions will be reduced in cost by 15% in real terms over the lifetime of the parliament, with the savings returned to front line care.\n- Families who accommodate a parent over 80 years old in the same dwelling will be entitled to deduct 100% of the cost of state-funded aged care services from taxation.\n- National Insurance ID Cards will be issued to all eligible persons to help ensure that health services are provided for those who are entitled to them.\n- The NHS will not fund DEI initiatives or champion any contested political causes. Services will be provided in English and Welsh only.\nPENSIONS, WELFARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY\nOur welfare system represents the duty we have to one another as citizens, and is central to our unity and respect for each other as a society. It is part of the greatness of our nation. However, benefits provided by the state must be targeted toward the truly vulnerable. The system as a whole must be qualified, contributory, affordable and fair to taxpayers. Our urgent future challenge is, first, to help the millions of our fellow citizens trapped in welfare dependency to find viable routes into employment and self-reliance, and secondly, to re-balance old age pension provision to a level sustainable by the UK tax base.\n- A national resilience strategy to inculcate principles of good mental health will be implemented across the nation in schools, colleges, universities and on social media applications.\n- The 5% of people who are under 35 years of age and receive disability benefit (a majority of whom have no qualifications) will receive personally targeted medical, education and mentoring assistance to get into work.\n- Long term unemployment will be abolished. All persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and deemed fit to work for more than 6 months will be employed by their local authority in civic improvement projects at the minimum wage (local authority funding to be increased to provide for associated costs).\n- All future cash wage increases will be matched by an increase in the automatic enrolment pensions levy at the rate of 20p for each pound, until the total individual pension contribution reaches 8% of salary. Over time this will build up a private pension pot for every citizen and augment the pool of national savings.\n- The state pension will be increased annually not by politically motivated metrics but, rather, by a quantum which is fully sustainable by the UK tax base.\n- We will create Community Hubs at Local Authority level to improve access to multidisciplinary social services saving claimants time and cost while increasing the efficiency and knowledge of welfare services.\n- National Insurance ID Cards will be issued to all citizens. Anyone living in Britain as a non-citizen will not be given recourse to public funds for at least 10 years after the granting of indefinite leave to remain status. NHS provision will be dependent on being ‘ordinarily resident’ in the UK for tax purposes, and with a history of NI contributions.\n- The housing benefit budget will be gradually reduced year by year. All of the available funds will be diverted into a capital programme of state house building across the nation.\nTECH REGULATION\nThe digital revolution brings significant benefit but has serious social costs and externalities. The scalable efficiencies which digital technology produces have coincided with an epidemic of anxiety and poor mental health – particularly in children and young adults. New threats of digital political interference, cyber warfare and AI are emerging and almost every aspect of our lives is subject to digital tracking, surveillance and a consequent loss of privacy. These challenges require a proactive and cooperative relationship between the citizen and business and – where necessary – a robust and protective approach from government.\n- All smart phones and similar devices supplied to, sold to or used by under 16s will be subject to age-restricted controls on apps and content – regulated by a national kite marking authority.\n- Smart phones will be banned in schools. Each school will be responsible for the confiscation and storage of such devices until the end of the school day. Schools will be required by law to impound devices found on students during the school day for 14 days.\n- The Online Safety Act will be strengthened to better protect the right to freedom of speech and promote personal responsibility. Social media companies will have a duty to ensure that their strategy for combating misinformation is politically impartial, transparent and compliant with UK law.\n- We will restore the British principle that speech will not be a police matter unless it clearly incites or threatens crime or terrorism. We will, however, firmly enforce existing laws against these.\n- The legal age of access to online pornography will be raised to 18 and age verification will be required, via proof of credit/debit card ownership or other accredited age confirmation method.\n- Advertising online gambling will be banned in the UK.\n- A “digital border” application will be created to detect digital content which is malignantly pornographic, supportive of terrorism or otherwise contrary to law. All internet service providers operating in the UK will be required to utilise this scanning software and take steps to block undesirable content.\nSEX-BASED RIGHTS\nThe liberal pursuit of individual autonomy and desire must be balanced by the common good. Some citizens feel at odds with the physiology and social role associated with their natal sex and can suffer distress. Transgender people should be treated with dignity and respect, in keeping with their acquired gender in most situations. However, these rights must be balanced against the need of natal females for safety and sporting fairness. Biological sex is real and politically significant. This requires an absolute stance on relevant legal definitions in some domains.\n- We support segregation by biological sex in sport. Fair competition is not secured if male-bodied transgender athletes are permitted to compete in women’s sport and, in the case of contact sports, the risk of injury can increase significantly.\n- We support segregation by biological sex in prisons and women’s refuges in order to safeguard the safety and privacy of natal females. Separate prisons or prison accommodation should be provided for transgender citizens to ensure their safety and privacy.\n- Transgender individuals wishing to change their sex marker should be allowed to do so. However, we support the continued necessity for medical gatekeeping in any legal change of sex marker. We oppose proposals that would allow someone to change their sex marker by self-identification only.\n- The Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act will be amended to ensure that sex-based rights which require protection in key domains are not undermined by a change in sex marker.\n- Healthcare spending and resources for gender dysphoric individuals, including long-term psychological intervention, should be provided at sufficient levels. Physical or drug-based medical treatments for gender dysphoria should be prohibited for anyone under 18 years of age.\n- We support the retention of biological sex and gender identity as distinct categories in public sector data gathering such as crime statistics, poverty metrics or public health research.\n- We support the use of plain English for discussions of biological sex in health and reproductive care.\nDEFENCE\nThe first duty of government is defence of the realm. After decades of foreign adventurism and disastrous attempts to impose our values on other societies by force, we need to focus on homeland defence – while continuing to protect our international interests. The British military is a source of pride and a symbol of national competence, but continuous cuts have weakened it. We will protect its standing, safeguard its professional excellence, properly resource it and overhaul defence procurement. Modern threats to our way of life are not exclusively military in nature: terrorism, organised crime and cyber-attack are evolving with speed and sophistication, and we will be vigilant and uncompromising against them.\n- Baseline defence expenditure will be raised to 2.5% of GDP across the lifetime of the parliament. Funds spent in support of conflicts such as Ukraine will be offset against foreign aid and not deducted from the defence budget.\n- NATO is a key pillar of UK and regional defence, and we will maintain our active role in the alliance, while advocating that other key European nations boost their defence contributions to 2.5% of GDP.\n- Build and maintain a continuous at sea nuclear deterrent and commit to the Dreadnought Class submarine programme as the sea-borne platform for this.\n- Implement a comprehensive overhaul in defence procurement to streamline commissioning, reduce waste, shorten delivery time and increase the scale, use and resilience of UK military industrial capacity.\n- Military recruitment and advancement will be based on merit and no other characteristics.\n- Ex-military personnel, where suitably qualified, will be given preference in post-service government employment and preference in social housing accommodation.\n- Reservists will be guaranteed a minimum of 10 days special annual leave from their employer (in addition to their statutory entitlement) to undertake military training. Small employers which may suffer financial hardship from this will be able to claim a rebate for this time from the MoD budget.\n- MI5 and the National Crime Agency will have their budgets increased in line with defence overall, and they will partner with UK universities to deepen development of the specific skills required to work in mission-relevant fields, notably cyber-security, signals intelligence and surveillance of terrorism risks.\n- We will restore the offence of sedition, abolished in 2009, and actively use this law to pursue those who incite terrorism overtly or covertly, or who act in flagrant support of the UK’s enemies.\n- We will improve national resilience through domestic ownership of key infrastructure, enhancing protections against technical and scientific espionage, and pursuing energy self-sufficiency.\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\nBritain’s foreign policy should promote, protect and defend Britain’s interests. Britain is not a charity, but we are a strong promoter of parliamentary democracy and individual liberty throughout the world. As such, we will pursue alliances with trusted nations to those ends and play a leading and constructive role within the UN, NATO and the Commonwealth.\n- Britain will not intervene militarily in foreign countries with a view to imposing western democracy or values, unless there is a clear and direct threat to our national security.\n- Britain will retain an independent nuclear deterrent, continue its NATO membership and the corresponding commitments to national defence spending, and maintain its position as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n- We will undertake a review of our involvement in all current international treaties to assess whether they remain fit for purpose, and whether they continue to serve the UK’s national interest.\n- We will pursue a joint strategic defence pact with Canada, Australia and New Zealand with an emphasis on force development, production and procurement aimed at domestic defence rather than projection of power.\n- We recognise that China is a major world power in the 21st Century and we will engage constructively with it as a trading partner. We will, however, ensure complete transparency of Chinese influence in UK institutions and forestall control of critical UK infrastructure.\n- We will pursue deeper defence and trade and investment cooperation with India, Japan and South Korea as major regional trading powers in the Pacific.\n- While defending our status as an independent democratic nation-state, we will engage constructively with our friends and neighbours in the European Union on trade, scientific and economic development and defence.\n- We will end the commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid.\n- We condemn Russia’s self-defeating invasion of Ukraine and support Ukraine’s continued resistance. However, we regard a cessation of military activity as a necessary precondition to a negotiated and lasting peace settlement and we support the involvement of all parties and the UN in pursuing such.\nCRIME AND JUSTICE\nHuman progress depends on an orderly, law-abiding society. Criminals should expect to be promptly apprehended, convicted, and proportionately punished. A strong, well-resourced police force and criminal justice system will pay for itself by deterring crime and boosting economic growth. We will strongly support the historic liberties afforded by the British constitution and the common law, rather than abstract universal rights which transfer power from parliament and the people to judges\n- British common law will remain the bedrock of the legal system: parliamentary sovereignty, trial by jury, presumption of innocence, freedom from pre-trial prejudice, and the right to legal representation.\n- Resources in front-line policing will be significantly increased with a focus on the highest crime neighbourhoods. Police will have one metric only: the reduction and detection of crime in their neighbourhood.\n- We will increase funding of the criminal justice system so that courts can deliver justice no later than three months after charge, and we will build prison capacity according to need. Prisons will become safe, orderly institutions – whatever it takes.\n- Sentences for repeat offences and violent crime will be doubled. Because most crime is committed by habitual criminals, anyone who is convicted of three serious offences over the age of 18 will serve a minimum of ten years in jail.\n- All persons released from prison will be allocated a job at a partner employer with all employment costs (at minimum wage) borne by the government for two years, if they do not have a job to go to.\n- The SDP is committed to maintenance of a high-quality public realm. Graffiti, vandalism, and anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated, with perpetrators subject to exemplary and visible community service orders.\n- Non-British citizens who serve jail time will be swiftly deported upon release from prison, and permanently barred from re-entry.\n- Cannabis will remain illegal and on-the-spot fines will be enforced for use.\nIMMIGRATION\nSelective immigration can make important contributions to society. However, in recent years successive governments have been too enthusiastic about mass immigration, too indifferent to integration and too tolerant of illegal migration. Recent levels of immigration are reckless and historically unprecedented. Excessively open labour markets have reduced wages and dis-incentivised training to the detriment of our fellow citizens, particularly the low paid. A return to moderate, controlled migration for a sustained period is essential and would benefit the nation. It would result in a less divided, more socially harmonious and more prosperous Britain.\n- In the interests of Britain’s community relations and the survival of our hard-won welfare state we will vigorously resist the idea of ‘open borders’. Britain’s immigration policy must be skills-based, needs-based, legal and subject to democratic control.\n- We will withdraw from the 1951 Refugee Convention, the ECHR and all other international instruments which deny UK border sovereignty. We will promote a new set of international agreements on refugee rights which are fit for purpose, protect genuine refugees and do not facilitate illegal trafficking.\n- We will reduce net migration to 50,000 per annum and promote a generation long cessation of ‘mass immigration’ in the interests of integration, solidarity and social cohesion. Agreements between key strategic partners may result in selective exemptions if clearly in the national interest.\n- All unsolicited asylum applications via breaches of the UK border will be declined. They will result in immediate repatriation or detention offshore within British Overseas Territories until repatriation is expedited. The UK will contribute to humanitarian resettlement of genuine refugees by offering 20,000 refugee visas annually to carefully vetted families fleeing major conflict zones.\n- A foreign spouse of a UK citizen will not qualify for UK residence if there is evidence that the marriage was entered into primarily to obtain admission to the UK. He or she must also demonstrate good quality spoken and written English. Family visas will be offered only to direct lineal ancestors or descendants of UK citizens.\n- No person will be offered UK citizenship unless they have spent 7 years resident in the UK with ‘probationary leave to remain’ (PLR) status. Any indictable offence or any act considered materially hostile to Britain’s social peace committed while on PLR will result in prompt deportation after a single review by a special tribunal.\n- Study visas will be cut by half to approximately 250,000 per annum and only allocated to students with places at accredited universities and colleges. Work visas will be restricted to those with specifically required skills and sponsored by employers with a strong record of paying UK corporate tax. Employers of illegal immigrants will be liable to fines of up to £100,000 per employee concerned and criminal penalties where the offence is knowing or systematic.\n- Exit checks at all UK points of departure will be reinstated and matched with visa entry data to ensure that overstay is tracked and prevented.\nSCHOOLS\nA thriving democracy depends upon an informed people: able to reason well, feel part of society, contribute to the economy, and live the fullest life possible. Children must be taught what they need for their chosen course in life, rather than corralled into academic courses which do not allow them to maximise their personal progress. We require excellence in academic education and increased opportunities for technical education.\n- New grammar schools will be established across the country in regional towns with relative disadvantage. Students will be admitted to these via examination and teacher assessment at KS3 (age 14).\n- Free school meals will be provided to all state school educated children during term time only.\n- A new subject, Wellness, will be introduced to the national curriculum in place of the current PSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Economic). This will instruct students in good psychological and lifestyle habits, including nutritional and physical fitness goals, money management, home economics, cyberhealth, self-control, good manners, and the destructiveness of drugs.\n- Schools will provide more options for those who are best suited to vocational and technical programmes, as well as academic courses. This means increasing the number of students doing BTEC programmes and increasing access for students to move into employment through this pathway.\n- Employers who take on a graduate apprentice from a technical school / BTEC programme at the age of 16 will receive a rebate of 25% of the first year’s wages for that employee. Employers who take on a school leaver without a basic qualification will be rebated 75% of the apprenticeship wage for two years, subject to a suitable training programme.\n- Suitable technical courses (equivalent to the current BTEC Level 3 at age 18) will be the normal requirement for acceptance into paid on-job training for public sector roles such as nursing and policing, which presently require degree courses.\n- We will reinforce the teaching of British history, politics, geography and literature up to GCSE level. Teaching in humanities subjects will be balanced and honest, and reflect Britain’s important contribution to the world in the context of its time. Teachers will avoid advocacy of unorthodox or sectarian agendas.\n- A national programme of resources and online support will be developed for parents who wish to home-school their children. Children who are home-schooled will sit invigilated key stage examinations and undergo safeguarding and socialisation checks at the appropriate ages.\n- Arbitrary limits on school exclusions will be scrapped. Students who are excluded for persistent disruptive behaviour will attend specialist schools where additional psychological and parenting support will be provided.\nHIGHER EDUCATION\nBritain’s universities are respected around the world, and the knowledge and innovation they bring must be preserved if we are to continue to flourish. However, the rapid overexpansion of the higher education sector has not returned the promised benefits for enough students, or for the country at large. Relentless loan repayments constrict the futures of graduates despite large taxpayer-funded write-offs. The structure and funding of this sector requires urgent reform. The research contribution of universities to the UK’s economy and our industry strategy will continue to be well-funded. We will also reinvigorate vocational qualifications to ensure that prospective students are offered the right variety of courses to benefit them and the community.\n- Reduce undergraduate tuition fees to £7,000 per year. Course costs above this level will be met by central government.\n- Tuition fees for taught courses and research in critical infrastructure and key sectors will be set to zero. In some cases, this benefit will oblige a period of work within the public sector post-graduation.\n- Balance national skills needs by reducing the number of new bachelor degrees and increasing funding for vocational qualifications.\n- Lower the interest rate on student loans to CPI and cap total repayments at 1.2 times the original value of the loan in real terms.\n- Expand access to “degree apprenticeship” programmes, hybrid degrees which balance academic study with practical workplace experience.\n- Postgraduate places will be only offered to international students in fields with high academic standing or industrial relevance.\n- Universities will establish a body to validate the English language skills of prospective international students before they are accepted for courses in the UK.\n- Boost government funding for university-based research, preferentially in areas of strategic industrial value, but also across areas of excellence in the arts and humanities.\n- Universities are for all. They will be expected to accommodate a wide variety of viewpoints, giving space for civil discussion without fear of harassment or no-platforming.\nACADEMIC FREEDOM\nFreedom of thought and inquiry together with freedom of expression are vital to a tolerant democratic society. A dangerous myth has emerged which holds that cultural questions are capable of rational arbitration which must, inevitably, lead to a single liberal view. Citizens holding a traditional, patriotic or religious outlook are often bullied and marginalised, stifling the open debate upon which a free and democratic society depends. Our charter outlines the fundamental rights all should enjoy both within and outside the academy.\n- The right to express your own opinions without being silenced or intimidated by those who disagree with you.\n- The right to be offended by what other people might say, but to respect their right to say it – and to get over it.\n- The right to be treated as an equal, irrespective of colour, creed, age, social class, sexual orientation, nationality or biological sex.\n- The right – indeed the duty – to challenge all established orthodoxies, even those of the academy itself.\n- The right to an education which is politically broad, free of indoctrination and introduces a wide variety of viewpoints.\n- The right to be able to hear outside speakers at university who possess a wide variety of views in a civil atmosphere and without harassment or intimidation.\n- The right to be judged by your lecturers purely according to academic ability, regardless of how greatly your political views might differ from theirs.\nCULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT\nWe cherish Britain’s culture which has made such a vast contribution to western and human civilisation. Our heritage is worthy of protection and we will defend it wholeheartedly against those who wish to denigrate and undermine it. Our culture is the foundation which allows everyone in these islands to nourish and support their personal growth to bring joy, contemplation, understanding, entertainment, social interaction and well-being.\n- The BBC will be funded from general taxation rather than a licence fee. It will support national cohesion by focusing on news, cultural and educational content less readily funded by commercial channels. It will be audited against the highest standards of balance and impartiality.\n- School league table criteria shall take greater account of provision and outcomes in music, technology, and the arts to give parents more information when choosing schools. All schools will be funded to provide after-school music or art tuition.\n- Public funding of culture, media and sports organisations will be conditional on those organisations respecting the principles of balance and free speech. Institutions that fail to do so, by censoring artefacts, promoting sectarian agendas or deterring people from civil discourse, will have funding withdrawn.\n- All significant statues and monuments will be listed and protected at national level.\n- A tax of 1% of turnover shall be levied on all Premier League football clubs to fund the construction of new football pitches and community facilities throughout the country.\n- Sports clubs shall be granted new rights to lease their sports grounds from local authority landlords on a long-term lease at a peppercorn rent – giving clubs security of tenure necessary to grow.\n- Except where extenuating circumstances prevent it, all schools will undertake a mandatory ‘daily mile’ whereby pupils and staff run, jog or walk one mile per day.\nFOOD, FARMING AND COUNTRYSIDE\nBritain’s food system is broken. For every £1 we spend on food, we spend another £1 in hidden costs. These costs are externalised into areas that don’t appear on the balance sheet – health, environment, animal welfare, and the well-being of food producers and wider rural communities. Successive governments have sacrificed long-term prosperity – our natural capital – for short-term gain. We propose a holistic approach to support our farmers, restore nature, revitalise rural communities, ensure food security and improve the national diet. The SDP’s plan for a resilient food system and thriving countryside is presented in full in our green paper Farms, Fields and Food.\n- Subsidies will be set at a sufficient level to enable farmers to produce food sustainably, targeting the most intensive and polluting sectors where the greatest impact can be achieved. Ultimately, we aim to remove dependence on subsidies by aiding transition to more profitable farming methods and ensuring producers are paid a fair price, but support will be guaranteed for as long as needed.\n- We will invest in agricultural technology and farmer-led research and innovation to make high-yield farming less environmentally damaging and small-scale farming more efficient.\n- At least 90% of existing farmland will be maintained for agriculture. Nature restoration projects will be targeted to non-food producing land and least-productive farmland. Best and most versatile farmland will be protected from all other land use types.\n- Through tax incentives and planning reform we will reverse the decline in small farms and restore diversity of farm size across the UK. A land acquisition scheme funded by inheritance tax will be used to create new market gardens, orchard villages, small farms and smallholdings. We will prohibit the sale of county farms by local authorities, and prevent the sale of any food-producing land to non-UK citizens or entities.\n- We will re-establish land-based colleges and invest in apprenticeships and mentoring schemes to facilitate access to farming, forestry, horticulture and other rural careers. The integration of food and farming into the school curriculum will be strengthened and will include farm visits and practical home economics and cooking classes.\n- Trade deals will not be allowed to disadvantage British farmers and food producers. A Buy British policy will be adopted for public sector procurement, with an emphasis on local sourcing. Both raw and processed foods will carry clear country of origin and animal welfare labelling.\n- We will support the establishment of regional Charter Co-operatives and marketing boards, enabling farmers, food producers and retailers to work together to process and sell food locally at viable prices. The Charter Co-op scheme will make healthy food universally available and affordable. We will establish infrastructure grants to improve the resilience and sustainability of local food networks.\nFISHERIES\nBritain is an island nation. We have a proud maritime history, rich fishing grounds and enjoy jurisdiction over the waters of 14 overseas territories – and yet we import most of the fish we eat. Fishing rights have fallen into the hands of a small and wealthy elite – including many foreign operators – while small-scale inshore vessels are squeezed out. Our fish stocks and the ecosystems which support them are an important national asset, but mismanagement over decades has allowed their depletion and degradation. We must restore a fully UK-owned and crewed fishing fleet. Government must also strengthen local supply chains and promote domestic consumption of British fish to improve regional economic development, national public health, food security and the UK trade balance.\n- The UK fishing and seafood sector will be expanded. Investment will be targeted to strengthen the economic self-reliance of smaller operators, train and maintain a workforce and equip large vessels to fish offshore stocks more sustainably.\n- Quotas will be set using scientific evidence to avoid overexploitation while minimising discards in mixed fisheries. Social, economic and environmental criteria will be considered in quota allocation. Once the UK fleet has been revived, quotas will only be granted to UK-owned and crewed vessels landing their catch in the UK.\n- Access to additional species quotas will be granted for small vessels along with financial support to enable them to adapt and exploit new fisheries.\n- Domestic consumption of sustainably-sourced British seafood will be increased via a public sector Buy British policy, clearer labelling and investment in local supply chain infrastructure.\n- The environmental impact of aquaculture will be reduced via new research and regulation, more sustainable feed sources, restrictions on antibiotic use, lower stocking densities, use of multi-trophic systems and co-location with wind farms.\n- The fishing industry and their wider communities will have a stronger voice in the establishment and monitoring of Marine Protected Areas. Commercial fishing will be given equal weight with other sea uses in marine spatial planning.\n- Coastal communities will be regenerated through a combination of affordable housing, selective restrictions on second homes and holiday lets, improved broadband and public transport, new industrial processing facilities, competitive business rates and tax regimes incentivising skills training.\nENVIRONMENT\nThe British countryside and coastal waters are part of our cultural heritage and identity. Wildlife habitats and the public realm in villages, towns and cities enrich the lives of our fellow citizens and they should be cherished. However, population growth, indifference and poor planning threaten our natural landscapes. Some institutions charged with protecting our wildlife and historic sites have abandoned their core purpose in favour of fashionable ideologies. Abstract international targets set by supranational organisations distract us from achieving meaningful local improvements. We need to protect our natural and historic environment from further loss and embark on a long period of restoration.\n- A national land-use plan will be produced to optimise use of our limited space and ensure that the interests of nature conservation, food security, energy security, housing, infrastructure and landscape quality are balanced.\n- We will support increased use of the greenbelt for smallholdings, county farms, allotments, market gardens and community orchards. Private sector housing development on greenbelt or high-grade agricultural land will be prohibited.\n- We shall mandate energy efficiency into the planning and building regulations system. Subsidies will be available for solar panel installations on existing commercial and residential buildings. Planning consent will not be granted for solar farms on agricultural land.\n- Single-use plastic in food retail and catering will be phased out within 3 years. Mandatory returnable deposits on drinks containers and toxic waste products such as batteries will be introduced.\n- Ancient woodland and veteran trees will be protected in both urban and rural environments. National tree cover will be increased – always abiding by the principle of ‘right tree, right place, right reason’. Agroforestry practices incorporating managed grazing will be supported. A national hedgerow protection and restoration plan will be implemented.\n- We will clean up our rivers by setting capital investment targets to prevent sewage discharges, by supporting farmers to reduce livestock density in sensitive catchments, and by robust enforcement of all water pollution regulations.\n- We will protect our historic buildings and landscape features, and ensure that the responsible institutions focus on this core purpose. We will support parish councils and community groups to prevent churches from falling into a state of disrepair.\n- We will enhance the public realm in our towns, cities and villages through sensitive planning and development, a zero-tolerance approach to vandalism and graffiti, and by funding local authorities to recruit, train and pay unemployed people to deliver civic improvement projects.\n- Overwhelming focus on climate ‘catastrophe’ is fostering anxiety and despair in children. From early years to key stage 3, all children will learn about British wildlife and be given opportunities to carry out practical conservation in their local area. The Natural History GCSE will teach the observation and identification of species, as well as introducing students to the inspiring achievements of Britain’s pioneering naturalists.\nANIMAL WELFARE\nAnimals are sentient beings and are an integral part of both the local environment and the planet we share. Humankind finds itself in a position of great power over our fellow living creatures and with that power comes great responsibility. We are committed to the highest standards of animal welfare.\n- Free trade agreements will require trade in animal-derived products to adhere to equivalent standards as UK animal welfare laws.\n- Financial support for UK agriculture will incentivise and reward farmers whose production systems adhere to higher welfare standards.\n- Species-specific limits will be introduced on maximum journey times and travel conditions for all farm animals.\n- The quantity of meat slaughtered under the Religious Exemption shall not exceed UK domestic demand.\n- Export of meat killed by non-stun slaughter methods is to be banned and the import of non-stun slaughter meat will also be banned unless the country of origin has equivalent animal welfare standards to the UK.\n- All meat products sold or served in the UK shall include clear labelling regarding the method of slaughter. Labelling to be clear if the meat is Halal or Kosher.\n- Abattoir inspections shall be increased and tougher sentencing will be introduced for individuals found to be mistreating animals.\n- Funding will be increased and directed towards developing and validating humane alternatives to animal experimentation.",

It will highlight some common aspirations of voters including affordable housing, decent publicly run utilities and a secure national border.\nCommenting on the election broadcast, the SDP’s leader William Clouston said:\n“So many fellow citizens feel ignored and patronised by the establishment political class. We wanted to produce a film which explored this and which had a little humour in it.\nThe big message is that there is a party which shares the sensible majority public view on things like immigration and housing – it’s the SDP.\nBasically, that’s why the SDP is here – to give the public something decent to vote for.”\nAfter its initial airing, the SDP’s election broadcast will be available for playback on BBC, ITV and other broadcasters.\nNotes to Editors:\nThe SDP is a patriotic, economically left-leaning and culturally traditional party.\nThe SDP’s full manifesto, entitled ‘Homecoming’, can be found at https://sdp.org.uk/.\nThe SDP has been in continuous existence since the 1980s and under its leader William Clouston since 2018 has re-entered national political life and debate.\nThe SDP is fielding 122 candidates in this general election, the highest number since 1987.\nThe SDP’s Facebook page is at https://www.facebook.com/SDPhq and its Twitter/X account at https://x.com/SDPhq.\nFor further information, please email info@sdp.org.uk.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-waning-of-the-common-life/content_63.html": "The common life in Britain has been on the wane for over half a century and may, if we’re not careful, be finally killed off by the pandemic.\nBritish people used to live, work, worship, drink, eat, and travel together, but now they increasingly do so alone. This development underpins the phenomenon of modern alienation and isolation, which has led to an increasingly unhappy and unharmonious nation. In virtually all walks of life, activities which we once undertook communally with friends, associates, or in family groups are now done alone and in private. Where we once shared we now hoard, what was proximate is now remote, and what was experienced in common is now encountered alone.\nThe first victim of our war against the COVID-19 pandemic was communal office life. The closure of workplaces is merely the latest example of the doors being closed on our life in common. We used to live together; often in extended families, or as lodgers, or in houses in multiple occupancy. Now we seem to aspire to be like the Swedes and enjoy total privacy in our studios or one bedroom flats. That the public washhouse, which convened entire neighbourhoods in Victorian and Edwardian times, gave way to the private bathroom was undoubtedly progress. However, the family bathroom is now itself giving way to a modern fetish for ensuite bathrooms which are, weirdly, often furnished with two separate ‘his and her’ wash basins. Why it is beyond some contemporary couples to share something as trivial as a sink is a matter for the psychologist. What’s next? His and her beds or houses?\nGone are the packed matinees on a Saturday afternoon – now replaced by people staying indoors, breathing stale air and gazing at screens all hours of the day. We’re entering the age of private cinema as surely as we are the private gym. What was a grand shared experience has become a narrower private one. Even sex, the data shows, is becoming a private matter. The ubiquity of pornography is making the old joke ‘sex is ok, but I prefer the real thing’ a reality. Perhaps this provides a clue as to why Britain’s Total Fertility Rate has plummeted well below replacement level – which if it continues will eventually result in the country simply fading away. Those who govern us are indifferent to this and to its impact on our culture, preferring instead to simply import new human ‘commodities.’\nAnd then there’s the loss of our pubs. With each pub closure, part of the fabric of British society is diminished. It removes from the public scene a forum of warmth, open debate, friendship, and possible sanctuary. Inns have also played a vital role in establishing and reinforcing our embedded rights for pubs, which have made a greater contribution to the development of English democracy than is generally realised. Genuine free speech and the ventilation of unpalatable facts must occur face to face rather than via some dreadful app. The making of a political point in a pub requires one to be able to justify it, the cowardice of an anonymous persona being unavailable. Pubs are certainly closer to the spirit of the Athenian Stoa than Twitter. Dr Johnson was surely right when he wrote in 1776 that there ‘is no private house in which people can enjoy themselves so well as a capital tavern’. Drinking at home alone is simply no replacement – and is probably worse for general public health.\nRemember when children used to walk to school? Now they are shuttled in private cars which competitively fly-park at the school gates. Gone is the walk to school in the fresh air, now rendered impossible in many localities due to noxious car fumes. And what about school dinners? Lunchtimes which used to be experienced – or suffered – in common with liver in gravy on Wednesday and fish on Friday are now replaced by pupils grazing informally from their own lunchboxes on a diet of Kit Kats, Coke, and crisps. A preoccupation with personal choice combined with dietary, allergen, and religious requirements are making the school meal, cooked in the kitchen from basic ingredients and eaten together, a thing of the past. To suggest its reinstatement would, of course, be seen as a rights violation.\nAs the pandemic ratchets-up further, shop closures contribute to the destruction of the high street, another arena which affords social interaction and human proximity. The city, town, or village centre is the quintessential social hub. The queue at the baker, the butcher; or more frequently the Post Office, is a necessary curative to modern impatience. The town centre is where we interact and see what one and other is doing out in the elements. The shift to soulless online retail – which affords no chit chat about the weather, no gossip, no eye to eye contact – seems unstoppable. As these powerful online monopolies demonstrate ever greater strength year after year, our liberal political class shows increasing indifference to resist them.\nMost Sunday mornings I cycle to one of a number of favourite churches in the Northumberland hinterland (St Michael’s at Warden, St John’s at Healey, St Giles at Chollerton.) Apart from the odd occasion in which the rural service rota provides an itinerant Anglican priest, they are empty. As I sit alone and survey the stained glass, empty choir stalls, and brass plaques with the names of members of the important local families; I ponder buildings which were not just places of belief, but were places of comradeship and belonging. I think it unlikely that the parishioners will return.\nThose of us who lament the loss of the common life are often accused of wanting a better yesterday. This is untrue. We want a better tomorrow and believe it depends – almost entirely – on what we can still do together.\nAs a 58yr old,I completely agree with the statement. I’ve raised 5 children and am raising grandchildren,but am called “ancient and not understanding of the world we live in ” because I cook,make them tidy up etc. And don’t allow TVs except for school.\nI particularly lament the loss of the highstreet shop\nThis community issue appeared several years ago with the traditional highstreet bank and the introduction of cash machines.\nI remember talking to a bank manager in a pub in Hartlepool on a Friday evening in 1988 and his comments were so true that he percieved that bank branches would close and the customer would loose contact with the sense of belonging to a bank knowing the staff on the counter and the bank manager .\nThank you William. Reading this makes me feel very sad concerning the future world. I am not a very sociable person but I miss communal experiences like the cinema and cafes. A world of alienation and loneliness beckons\nSadly, very true. No wonder there is an increase in mental illness and loneliness.\nWhen the restrictions are over, we should share more, spend more in local shops, appreciate our pubs, churches and cinemas more.\nThe loss of banks and post offices from our towns should have been resisted vehemently. The government actually exacerbated the closure of post offices by paying benefits and pensions directly into bank accounts.\nHumans are social creatures. We must fight not to lose our sociability.\nValid points about a sad, sad situation, and decline in quality of life, that I fear will get much worse.\nLife in Britain is steadily being sterilised, covid has now speeded up the process. We have more communication and information at our fingertips than ever before, yet never have we been more polarised.\nExellent article , sums up the drift into atomisation and rampant individualism perfectly.\nAs a founding member of the SDP I am at once disconcerted and at the same time strangely comforted by this. But I suspect this may be an age thing (I am 58). Much of the above seems like nostalgia (comfort) and to rejoin the SDP I would need to see more about how you reconcile the undoubted human progress we have seen and the (perhaps) retrograde evolution in social standards. We are certainly in a different world from 1983 when I joined, so the SDP should be helping people to come to terms with the new world rather than hankering after one that we 50 somethings enjoyed 30 years ago. Our children and grandchildren need that type of direction not nostalgia.\nWhy would you want to help “people to come to terms with the new world” when our increasingly atomised society leads to so much unhappiness and friction? If we help “people to come to terms with the new world” this means participating in a collective amnesia of our social nature. Perhaps you meant that we should help people to nurture new types of common life and that you will be interested to read what the SDP comes up with?\nHighlighting the more socially beneficial aspects of common life from the past is not nostalgia, it is a starting point from which we hope to work out how to replicate those positive social outcomes, but in a new context. This isn’t easy, as the time and location points at which humans can interact face-to-face are being reduced (see the article above).\nA very interesting and hard hitting article. So much of what was common to me growing up in the sixties has now gone. Another community asset that bonded us was council housing, where we knew our neighbours and looked out for each other. Also gone is the neighbourhood policeman. There was a policeman who lived in a police house and patrolled and knew the locality. He knew all the villains and there was a healthy respect shown and reciprocated.\nUncontrolled immigration helped to destroy a lot of the fabric of society as newcomers came in and long established families moved out.\nExcellent commentary William that sums up perfectly the malaise of contemporary Britain. What is needed is a cultural renewal that emphasises the importance of community responsibility and responsible citizenship. Instead of the current focus on young people being vacuous selfish celebrities they should be responsible citizens. To do this we need to stop exporting jobs to cheap countries and reinstitute an apprenticeship scheme for British citizens. To take inspiration from the past to ensure a cultural renewal is badly needed.\nMaybe the sdp should back unlock Democracy’s campaign for a written constitution and even become a Federal republic with decentralisation of Government, We need to protect our high street from parasitic corporations like Amazon\nNailed it… you need to get this out there by getting a shed more exposure… once again William is bang on with every point made… the most ironic thing is it’s what everyone is seeing and thinking…. it’s not to late. Just perhaps we might have a man & a party to finally put a fight up against the others parties… do not waver from the theme you have set out William. Loved every sentence and paragraph even though it’s so sad hearing the truth.\nAlso the spontaneity of attending professional sport has been removed. At one time you could queue at the gates for Test Match cricket and pay a reasonable price for admittance.You could take your own alcohol into the game without having to pay ridiculous amounts for a pint. Safetyism is an excuse for maximising revenue. The same with top flight football,all games are all ticket,with no standing. Football tragedies such as Hillsborough have been made an excuse for maximising revenue. No longer can you just attend on a whim,everything has to be preplanned . The result is you have half a crowd of rich idiots absolutely plastered dressed up as nuns at the Test Match. Futhermore terrestial TV doesnt show Test cricket live in this country.\nAll our school fields are fenced off ,over safety /trespass/paedophile and dog dirt fears. Kids (and groups of adults) used to play on the school cricket square out of school hours! And football.\nI would hope your party would reopen the school fields like they used to be and eradicate safetyism to this degree. Get communities back together keeping fit and do something to make professional sport accessible to all.",

Rising cases within a largely vaccinated population do not justify restrictions, as the link between cases and fatalities has been substantially weakened.\nAs the government’s official figures show, the daily death rate from Covid-19 has not risen above 200 since March. The current rise in cases represents a wave of largely asymptomatic infections. Simply put, any strain the health service comes under from flu and Covid-19 would solely be due to incompetence and under-provisioning on the part of the NHS and the government.\nThe NHS exists to serve the British people, not the other way around. It is unreasonable to set Britain on the path to routine seasonal restrictions for the sake of a health service that is chronically unable to meet the basic goal of protecting the nation’s public health.\n“If the BMA’s advice were taken, we’d be making the same mistakes as in previous lockdowns,” says SDP Leader William Clouston. “It’s understandable that doctors wish to protect the NHS as we approach winter, but the government’s job is to assess the wider costs of such restrictions and to the impact on our embedded rights and freedoms. The vaccinations have provided a huge degree of protection to the public. It makes no sense at all to back track now – we need to go forward and take the win.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_arent-you-open-yet/content_115.html": "The library I work in is gradually opening up. There is a cap on numbers admitted and jargon such as ‘grab and go’ ‘ready reads’ and ‘sanitiser points’ reflect a decidedly new normal, but at least things are heading in the right direction.\nNot everyone is convinced. A recent tweet spoke of public libraries seemingly doing all they could to keep people out, in contrast to the attitude of most shops who are busy doing whatever it takes to welcome us back.\nIn the comments that followed it was suggested this was a public sector problem, that libraries had no profit or usage incentive, and that this excessively cautious approach was somewhat ironic given how often we are urged to join campaigns to keep them open.\nThe SDP is pro-public services, but not in the uncritical ways of Labour and increasingly the Tories. Too often sclerotic, bureaucratic and, when overseen by local authorities, burdened with cack-handed political leadership, these services are too important to be given a free pass.\nTo be fair, the last decade has been difficult for local authorities. Cuts in funding from central government have coincided with increased demand for local services. Arguably, most of the low hanging fruits of greater efficiency have been picked, so someone better qualified than I will have to explain how, in their day-to-day operations, these services can be improved. But here’s where we could start.\nIn England and Wales, political and electoral reform is needed to revitalise local democracy. Local government is too fragmented, leaving many people confused as to who does what in their locality. Weak electoral accountability leads to a lack of critical oversight on public procurement. Unitary authorities across the board would at least bring democratic clarity. City and regional mayors may, to some, already be a good solution to these problems. Personally, I am sceptical.\nOf the need for electoral reform in favour of a fairer electoral system, I am more certain. The first past the post system leaves many councils in England and Wales with a single party holding in excess of 75% of the seats, way out of proportion to their actual vote.\nIn the recent local elections, many voters in Redditch, Gateshead, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and Dudley will have been left feeling cheated. In London, three boroughs, Lewisham, Newham and Barking and Dagenham all have 100% Labour councillors with no opposition whatsoever, even though substantial numbers voted for other parties.\nThese councils spend much of their time, and our money, propagating identity politics and all things woke. Aside from being insufferably sanctimonious, this ideology dominates these councils’ corporate culture and often bears little relation to the concerns of their communities at large. Seeking the quiet life, even the Conservative-led councils among them acquiesce in much of this. But explaining that would require another article.\nUnfortunately, skewed priorities have consequences. A focus on identity politics relegates other concerns to the margins. Preferential treatment for some means disadvantage for others, and with it the neglect of ‘unfashionable’ services. Witness the plight of the elderly and disabled recipients of residential and home care services during the pandemic. Or the vulnerable young girls of Rotherham and other provincial towns and cities, denied protection from grooming gangs.\nThe SDP’s New Declaration spoke of the need for a values and virtues-led cultural renewal. When strengthening the common bonds which unite us, and re-enforcing communitarian impulses in public life, the public sector should be an exemplar. Not a place where being highly competent is less important than holding the ‘right’ views. Where poor performance is overlooked, or worse, institutionalised.\nOur libraries are open, and soon we should be able to forgo the face masks and ‘triage’ patrols by the front door. A diverse workforce in every sense, the best of us take pride in serving the community and strive to do better. Some of our most able staff – those embodying the values and virtues needed – were not brought up here. It’s almost as if they had somehow dodged a deep-seated malaise affecting the rest of us. It’s funny that.\nWe need to protect our services and rights from this awful government and the sdp could replace Labour as the no2 main political party in Britain\nToo many local authorities too eager to implement coalition/tory cuts with little in the way of “fighting back” at the same time, in the main, trade unions seeming to disappear rather than doing their job of representing their members’ interests.\nThe utter dysfunction of council house rents is gerrymandering at its best. In North East Hampshire, area I know well a two bed council house is £420 month yet same street with private tenant £900 plus! When tenant unfortunately needs care it is free if council tenant since no assets. Neighbour who rents will be out if landlord needs to cover care costs and sell. Council house tenants open to manipulation when more cash spent in that area, hence gerrymandering. All rents regardless of public or private tenancy should be geared towards salary of tenants end of.\nYou make some really good points about how Labour councils use identity politics. It can be incredibly divisive, giving the impressive that the majority don’t matter, are ignorant and need reeducating, and the emphasis on *difference* is really undoing the historic fight to be treated equally.\nMetro Mayors are a terrible idea. Most cities and regions rejected them when asked in referendums nearly 10 years ago. The Tories imposed them anyway, simply altering the catchment area, for example from Manchester to Greater Manchester. If local democracy is to work, we need more citizens involvement, not some individual ‘knight in shining armour’ who is going to solve all our problems. It’s a political model that simply encourages passivity in my opinion. And who needs more distant unwieldy unitary authorities?

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_betting-the-farm/content_105.html": "Labour’s Net Zero plans will fail both farmers and the climate, argues ROB PALMER\nThe Labour government’s push for Net Zero has created a false dichotomy: a choice between a thriving agricultural sector and a healthy planet. This narrative, increasingly peddled by both the media and politicians, pits our farmers against our climate goals, painting a picture where one must be sacrificed for the other.\nBut this is a dangerous oversimplification, ignoring the immense potential for synergy between agriculture and climate action. The recent Climate and Nature bill highlights this misunderstanding, where farmers are forced to ‘rewild’ their land as in what is seemingly the only solution to achieve CO2 and biodiversity goals. But this threatens our food security and rural economies.\nRecent headlines highlight this unnecessary conflict. “Farmers fear Labour’s green agenda will cripple food production” in The Daily Telegraph, while The Guardian warns of “Growing tensions between farmers and environmentalists over Net Zero targets.” This rhetoric, focused on restrictions and sacrifices, ignores the innovative solutions that can benefit both farmers and the environment.\nLabour’s current Net Zero strategy relies heavily on expensive and unproven technologies like Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Capture (DAC). These are “techno-fixes” – grand, centralized projects that require vast infrastructure and energy inputs. While potentially playing a role in the future, their reliance on a domestic energy grid that is limited and the most expensive in Europe would suggest that these aren’t viable now.\nInstead of pouring billions into these vanity projects, we should be investing in natural climate solutions that work with nature, not against it. Two such solutions, ripe with potential, are biochar and enhanced weathering.\nBiochar, a charcoal-like substance produced from the pyrolysis of organic waste like crop residues or green council waste, offers a such synergistic benefits for climate and agriculture. By stabilising the carbon in biomass, you remove the potential of CO2 being released through combustion or decomposition. When applied to soil, biochar improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, leading to increased yields and reduced reliance on fertilisers. It’s one solution for the environment and farmers.\nEnhanced weathering involves spreading finely-ground silicate rocks on farmland. As these rocks weather, they react with CO₂ from the atmosphere, locking it away as stable carbonates. This process mimics natural rock weathering but at an accelerated rate, effectively drawing down atmospheric CO₂. The feedstock for this process is the by-product of our domestic quarry industry and therefore, much like biochar production, is hugely abundant. The weathering process releases essential nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, boosting crop growth and increasing soil pH, much like liming. Again, to the benefit of farmers.\nThese solutions are not theoretical. Studies by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology have shown the potential of biochar to sequester significant amounts of carbon while improving soil health. Similarly, research at the University of Sheffield has demonstrated the efficacy of enhanced weathering in both carbon removal and yield enhancement. Biochar alone has over 600,000 articles on Google Scholar.\nYet, despite the evidence, Labour’s Net Zero strategy largely ignores these win-win solutions. Instead of focusing on expensive, top-down technologies, we should be empowering farmers to become active participants in the fight against climate change. What is more frustrating is that there are companies across the UK commercialising both technologies with no support from the government, despite these benefits.\nImagine a future where farmers receive carbon credits for implementing biochar and enhanced weathering, providing a new income stream whilst reducing their input costs. Agricultural waste is transformed into valuable biochar, creating local jobs and boosting rural economies. Healthy soils, enriched by biochar and weathered minerals, produce abundant food with fewer chemical inputs.\nThis is not a pipe dream. This is an economically-viable and sustainable future where agriculture and climate action work hand in hand. It’s time for Labour to ditch the false choice and embrace a Net Zero strategy that benefits both our agricultural sector and the planet.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_we-must-pay-families-to-have-children/content_19.html": "The past several decades have seen a decline in many of the expectations and norms surrounding family life, with Britain seeing increases in single-parent households, divorces, and instances of child neglect. But underneath all of this is an even more disturbing trend – an outright demographic collapse, in which Britain’s workforce is too small to maintain a competitive economy, the welfare state, and social protection for the elderly.\nSince a peak in the 1960s the British birth rate has been in continuous decline towards 1.6 children per woman. This is well below the amount of births needed to avoid population decline – the “replacement rate” – of 2.1 children per woman. Ultimately, the result over the course of decades has been that the workforce has dwindled, while the non-working population continues to grow.\nWithout intervention, this demographic collapse is set to be one of the biggest crises facing our country. It threatens to totally undermine the ability of British society to provide prosperity, a safety net, and a decent standard of living to all.\nWhy has this happened? One of the biggest reasons is that child-rearing has become nigh unaffordable to many working people, who simply do not have the time or the financial stability to comfortably sustain a larger family with both parents in work. Amid surging house prices and stagnant wages many younger couples are now encouraged to delay having children, as the trade-off between financial security and family grows ever-more harsh.\nSo far successive governments have handled this issue by simply kicking the can down the road indefinitely, or relying on labour substitution by way of mass immigration. But whereas birth rate increases provide clear long-term planning indicators for new housing, healthcare, education and transport infrastructure, huge influxes of working-age migrants in short periods do not and place huge strain on infrastructure and social services.\nThere is a radical solution to this crisis: pay married couples to have children. Specifically, Britain should pay married couples £500 per month per child under the age of 18. This move would not only make having multiple children financially viable to many whose dream of family life is now unreachable, but also totally reshape our relationship with work and address many of today’s most pressing social issues.\nA family income will dramatically change economic life for families. It would serve to reduce the trade-off between child-rearing and earnings from employment for parents, which has a direct effect of making it much easier for couples to choose to have a child in the first place. However, this is but the tip of the iceberg.\nAt a macroeconomic level, a family income will serve to drive up wages across the board. This is because many families will be able to afford to reduce their participation in the labour market to care for their children, with some parents dropping out entirely to move towards a single-breadwinner model. This represents a drop in the labour supply available to industry, which means that to compete for the smaller pool of workers businesses will have to push up wages, along with conceding other improvements to working conditions.\nThis, in turn, will drive a positive feedback loop across the economy: workers will earn higher wages, which in turn will make it much more affordable for families inclined to do so to cut their total hours in the labour force. Indeed, a family income will help all workers through bringing an end to the all-too-common low-wage, high-hours model of employment faced by many workers.\nIn addition, a family income will also make for happier and healthier families. This is because the condition that a couple must be married to receive a family income will provide an incentive for families to raise children in a two-parent setting.\nStudy after study has demonstrated that children raised in two-parent households tend to enjoy much greater educational attainment, have lower rates of criminality, and improved mental health, and so encouraging the two-parent model should have a robust knock-on effect for child welfare. Research has also shown that married couples with children tend to be substantially happier than the general population, so long as they’re financially stable.\nWhat’s most surprising about a family income is how affordable it is. If we assume for argument’s sake that every one of Britain’s 15.2 million under-18s is eligible, a cash payment of £500 per month per child would cost the nation £91.3 billion annually. While this is a large outgoing, most of the funding can come from efficiently reallocating current spending.\nFor example, family benefits, income support, and tax credits cost the state £46 billion per year – these can be totally phased out and replaced by a family income. Housing benefit, which costs the Treasury £25 billion per year, can also largely be replaced by a family income, and the government’s £35 billion annual budget for personal social services and other benefits will also be able to shrink as a family income will reduce the number of claimants.\nThis means that, potentially, a family income may break even in the long-run through replacing much of the social protection budget. In this way, a family income will actually serve to make our welfare system more affordable, efficient, and responsive to the needs of individuals – taking responsibility and power away from state bureaucracy, and giving it to individual families.\nAt the heart of the family income proposal is a challenge to radically rethink our social fabric, to place a family back at the centre of our way of life, and to give everyone greater freedom to pursue the best ends they can in life. A family income will rejuvenate our human capital and fix the birth-rate crisis, but it will also make us a healthier and more prosperous society.\nA radical yet refreshing proposal. Ultimately, we need to fix the incentives structure facing young people to make child rearing actually viable. Much of this must come from helping to end house price inflation and wage stagnation, but this measure will definitely tackle the latter while also helping to finally pay families for the reproductive labour they do.\nRearing the next generation is an incredibly important task. Why shouldn’t it be compensated?\nThis article is based on a false premise. That a decline in population is a bad thing.\nFirst let’s dispense with the neo-liberal propaganda that we need more young people to support our aging population. Not true. We currently have over 600,000 unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 24. We also have hundreds of thousands of young people currently in part time work in the gig economy. If we have a shortage of skills then that is due to lack of training not a shortage of young people.\nSecond, with the forthcoming advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) there are going to be mass redundancies in many areas of work.\nSo let’s turn to £500 per child per month. So a couple/single would get £2,500 per month after tax for 5 children or £5,000 after tax for 10 children. Over £600 and £1,200 per week respectively. Nice work if you can get it. This proposal is not serious.\nAs for housing, increasing household income is not the answer – it will just drive up house prices and rents. We need to carry out SDP policy – build more council houses and restrict immigration.\nI do agree that a two parent family is much better than a one parent family and in my view every child should have the chance to experience the presence of its father. In this context our current allocation of council houses to never married single mothers is doing more harm than good.\nI also agree that long hours and low wages are absurd given mass unemployment. But mass unemployment is not an accident and neither is mass immigration. They are methods employed to keep down wages and keep rents high – very profitable for the more backward business and landlord sectors. In a rational society, unemployment would be kept down by cutting hours and having wages at a liveable level. This would necessitate international agreement to prevent the current race to the bottom concerning hours and wages. Import controls could also be used.\nA single bread winner model is no longer the norm, especially amongst professional couples. It is not something the SDP could attach itself to, although I would agree that this should be a choice for parents.\nFinally, I repeat, there is no birth rate crisis, but there is a crisis facing our young people: that of singles accommodation, housing for young families, growing poverty, training and jobs. I appreciate the article attempts to address some of these questions but in my view, from the wrong direction.\nHello Roger, thank you for a measured and refreshingly well-written response to my article.\nI’ll try and address everything you’ve said here one by one, starting with the claim there is no birthrate crisis. While you are correct skills shortages, unemployment and the gig economy are substantial problems in underutilising the younger workforce, the amount of young people available are still nowhere near enough to sustain the incoming mass of retirement-aged baby boomers and even the first trickles of Gen X. Even if you successfully managed to retrain and reindustrialise fast enough, you’re still looking at a huge glut in the workforce, the solution to which will be mass-migration most likely, which brings me to the second point: most of the steady growth in 18-30s is coming from migration to begin with, so your solution relies on continuing the undercutting of domestic labour supply with a relatively porous border, which is part of the feedback loop in lack of skills with young people.\nFurther, to reiterate, this 600k is simply nowhere near enough to sustain the retired population; Japan is currently experiencing this where the government is considering proposals like retirement at 80, and companies are altering contracts to work well into the 70s. It is simple mathematics that you cant have a simultaneously shrinking workforce on the bottom end, and a growing group of dependents on the other. Indeed, even with the implementation of this policy, there may have to be measures taken to slow the retirement crisis by ways of raising the retirement age, or levying additional taxes to sustain the state pension. The picture isn’t good, even with the sensible measures you’ve proposed, the birth rate has to go up, or the elderly have to lose their quality of late life. I don’t think either of us wants that.\nHowever, if we take your assumption of our current number of youth being enough further, there is an additional problem: you are effectively saying we can sustain roughly one more retirement generation here. What happens after that? Retirees will still outnumber the younger workforce drastically, which without measures to boost the birth rate will continue on its downward trend; you’ve presented a plan to save the boomers, but abandoned everyone who comes after. Sure you could argue the birth rate will climb again by reskilling/higher wages/economic restructuring, but again, the time this takes is nowhere near enough to mitigate disaster. Action needs to be taken immediately, and oppositional arguments could just as easily be reframed as “abolish unemployment benefits entirely because in the future we will have abundant work and AI”\nWhich brings me to your second point, mass-automation is not coming. Mass-automation has been predicted for decades, and has repeatedly failed to manifest the impact its proponents claim, indeed usually it has an adverse effect of lowering barriers to entry into certain fields (accountancy and lawyers for example, where automated tabulation of documents expanded the number of people working in both fields as utilising them became more accessible to begin with; almost like a modern version of the medieval guild system transforming into a mass-market). The pandemic has also given us a very interesting insight into automation: in theory we could scrap huge portions of the economy, namely physical in-person activities on the high street, and still function at the same level materially. After all, we furloughed a huge chunk of the workforce and put them out of work. However, the moment the lockdowns were lifted, many in the retail/high street sector returned to work, or will return to work as the sector recovers. There is demand for many human experiences automation is often touted as inevitably about to destroy. Lastly, it is important to note AI is being extremely overhyped by Silicon Valley to generate investment, we are about to enter what has been termed an ‘AI winter’, wherein failure to deliver on promises means massive divestment from the sector, and stagnant advance within it for a few decades. Mass-automation is a PR stunt, not a reality, and regardless, its pointless to base policy on futuristic speculations of a social and economic ‘dues ex machina’.\nThe proposal itself: it is completely against all available data we have that there would be some great mass of couples having even 5 children, let alone 10. I’d suggest looking at fertility data from across the 19th and 20th centuries here. Sure, there may exist a functionally small handful who do, and good luck to them, but the vast majority will likely be in the realm of 3, some on 4, with the distribution curve of births tailing off hard from there. Humans do not just have children as economic units, they have them because it is a qualitative experience and human impulse; the grant policy is to allow that once again, as our current economic framework (which we both agree on) artificially suppresses and renders extremely difficult that natural, human process. Further, a repeat issue with this criticism of “abusing the system” that arises is people seem to forget the money isn’t just going to the parents, they still have to care for the children by feeding them, clothing them, dedicating time to them, etc. This is not only economically costly (hence the grant), but is additionally emotionally and physically taxing (especially if someone is just pumping out children constantly, the strange scenario this criticism relies on). The concern raised almost seems to be entirely around a complaint that it’d be ‘too easy’ for people to raise a larger family, in which case, thats the point of the policy. Plus, having 5-10 kids is a huge boon to future society and the workforce, as explained above, so the cost is offset in their parents very comfortable retirement. I can’t think of anything more communitarian than that.\nThe single breadwinner model has been phased out yes, but as my article explains, this is largely artificial, and has had disastrous consequences from the actual quality of parenting through to economic prosperity. There is an assumption here that ‘young professional couples’ is a cultural inevitability and not downstream from sweeping neoliberal structural reforms. This is termed ‘the two income trap’ and is highly worth reading into. I think we both agree that the pre-neoliberal economic order was far superior, and SDP policy mostly aims at restoring it: the nuclear family/breadwinner model was an integral part of that order, and indeed, so was a family allowance that took the exact form of my proposal here.\nThere is certainly a crisis facing our young people, but I think whats often missed is that a lot of us would like to have a family and raise kids, not just have a good job. We are denied a whole roster of state benefits prior generations had as well as a less precarious economic system. I think throwing out policy proposals like this on the basis of structural economic adjustment would be akin to expecting the Britons of the 1940s to rebuild without any welfare state assistance or government intervention/planning of the economy: it’d be long, painful, economically unsound and unfair. Finally, one aspect of everyone seems to miss is its not just economic, its human: family life is a joy, having children and raising them is conducive to a happier, healthier society in and of itself, not just because it conveys economic benefits; this neoliberal financial tabulation of families is alien to me, I see them as imperative to healthy socialisation of both the individual and the collective, and the psychological data I cited in my article is just the tip of the iceberg there (as you yourself said, healthy families produce happier people). A society that cannot successfully reproduce itself and allow people to widely participate in the joy of family life is a selfish, miserable and short-lived one.\nThe Tories will deservedly possibly lose the next general election Labour are unelectable permanently neither party have any vision or inclination to help British people there needs to be more incentives for people to get on in life the governmental system in this Country needs fully dismantling as does the huge taxation system\nThe population of the world is too big for our planet. At some point we need to accept that we cannot keep our population at the size it is.\nThis article appears to disregard the role of retired people in out community. Our GDP is largely based on cash, salaries and wages etc.\nTaking one of the two people parenting children might eventually lead to a larger workforce however in the short time it might well reduce the workforce.\nIf the government were to increase the support of families by offering a market rate for child care it would immediately offer the opportunity of choice to couples when to have children and how and when either would have a break in their career.\nIt would greatly increase the numbers of those working in the childcare sector. Highly skilled parents often but not always females could maintain their skills, upgrade or retrain in other areas and not suffer the effect on their own careers and futurevpemsions.\nMany older individuals are currently providing child care or support to their own parents, often leading to their early exit from the jobs market. We know we did and we do!\nGreater support for the older persons care sector could keep many of these supporting their parents in the jobs market.\nAlso many voluntary posts are carried out by the ‘retired’ lol.\nIn our town the open spaces are kept tidy by groups mainly of the retired. The Britain In Bloom is run by the retired as are many charities etc.\nWithout the activities of these the community environment would be a far worse place.\nThe decrease in male fertility is unlilely to be an economic side effect much more likely to be an environmental issue. Some couples are choosing not to have children because of the uncertainty of the future from an environmental stance.\nThe article does not appear to consider these other aspects.\nI believe that this proposal is completely unaffordable, and whilst it might be well intentioned it is the sort of idea that Labour under Corbyn would have come up with.\nVery interesting proposal with a lot to think about. I understand the wish to promote marriage and responsibility, but it seems unfair that children of single parents or unmarried parents would miss out on the family income, thus reducing their life chances? Would the family income only being available to married families, would this not create a cohort of kids stigmatized and alienated?\nIt’s naïve to think benefits currently going to single parents can be phased out. Those parents will continue to need them unless you think they should be incentivised to marry the first person they can find to get into this scheme. What about people in abusive relationships? Are they to be penalised for escaping?\nMuch as we want to incentivise stable families, we have to recognise this cannot always be achieved and provide some means of support for those who are in a position now.\nAs for population decline, the population of the world as a whole continues to rise, and is unsustainable. While we might have a local problem here, we have to consider the global as well. The real problem is that human beings have built our whole economy since our species emerged on the idea of growth, and that cannot go on for ever in a finite world. At some point we need a new economic model not based on more people working harder in the next generation. What that model should be is the challenge. No one knows – we’ve always used the growth model and know nothing else – but it clearly can’t last for ever. Economists might argue otherwise, but economists work with numbers, which are infinite, rather than a planet, which is not.\nWhy not just do an Universal Basic Income and expand tax exemptions for married couples\nThank you Ken, this does feel like a betrayal for single parents.\nWe already sacrifice so much, and have been betrayed by a partner who does not want, or is unfit to be involved in their child’s lives. Many of us single parent mothers work too.\nThis will only increase the number of children living in poverty, and stigmatise children from devoted single parent homes.\nI understand the logic here, and agree with most of it.\nHowever, the fact that you have left out single parents, who work and look after their children, feels like a betrayal.\nWe have already been betrayed by a partner who is not prepared/willing to help, and deserve more support than we currently receive.\nWhy would you suggest aiming such a policy at married couples only? It seems archaic in the 21st century to deny any rights to those not married. What of those various other arrangements of couples that have children but aren’t married?\n“There is a radical solution to this crisis: pay married couples to have children. Specifically, Britain should pay married couples £500 per month per child under the age of 18.”\nThis £500 a child seems to be a figure that has literally plucked out of the air without any thought on a cap on the number of children. I totally agree that married family life should be encouraged and a return to a generous married family allowance with a generous child allowance say capped at 4 children would be more prudent.\nThe article is a starting point for discussion, but far from a policy I could support.\nI like this idea but I do feel it is a bit mean on single parents, (usually mums) many of whom would love to be married. And of course on their children. So I think maybe they should be included. But perhaps they should not be given priority for council homes but instead get housed together in flats with shared facilities like washing machines and a common room with the hope being that they can support each other more easily and children grow up with with important uncle/auntie figures even where there isn’t a second parent.\nThis is a brilliant idea. So much of the benefit system has worked against the traditional family. This is the first policy I’ve discovered which actually supports and encourages families.\nAs a married father with 5 children, I am all in favour.

Henry brings two decades of strategic experience at the highest levels of international security. More recently, in the realm of politics, he was leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).\nHenry’s roles have included Chief Planner for the European Common Security and Defence Policy and Senior Adviser to the Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). At the start of his career, Henry laid the foundations of his later successes in roles with Thames Valley Police and the British Army.\nHenry says: “We need to put the interests of the United Kingdom and its people first, and build national self-sufficiency and resilience. That doesn’t rule out collaborating with other countries, but our own interests should always be the priority.\nHenry sees the forthcoming strategic defence review as an early policymaking priority in this area. The SDP wants to see a full-spectrum capability across defence so the country can operate independently if necessary.\n“It’s wrong to think that in today’s complex and fast-moving world, we can quickly ramp up our defence capability as soon as we need to. Countries like Poland, Germany, Holland and Finland are now spending more of their national wealth on an independent defence capability. We are slipping back.”\nHenry and the SDP represent British people who want to move away from foreign interventions and nation-building in other countries – which have proven so damaging and destabilising – towards a realistic and pragmatic approach to defence and security.\nHenry says: “We need to build a sense of confidence, prosperity and security. Not only ‘guns and bullets’ security – important though that is – but the emotional security that comes from living in a stable community that isn’t subject to uncontrolled change.”\n“Our vision is all about our own people. We want to give them a feeling of security, without which, people cannot build prosperous lives. It’s more about emotional security than guns and bullets.”\nWilliam Clouston, Party Leader of the SDP, says: “I couldn’t be more delighted to have Henry on board. Henry brings a depth of knowledge and experience in the field that we’ve never had before as a party. And that’s what we need to build mature and rounded policies that will actually work. It’s an exciting appointment.”\nHenry concludes: “We’ve had enough of politicians giving headline promises without working out how to deliver them. One of the things that attracted me to the SDP was that everybody in the party is keen to understand even the most complex issues and navigate them. That’s what makes SDP’s policies stand out – they’re realistic and measured.”",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2023_05_05_sdp-wins-again-in-leeds/content_199.html": "The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has secured a further dramatic victory over Labour in Leeds by winning a second seat on the City Council in Middleton Park. SDP candidate Emma Pogson-Golden won the seat convincingly just one year after Wayne Dixon’s stunning victory in 2022.\nCouncillor Pogson-Golden commented:\n‘I’ve lived here all my life. This is a victory not just for the SDP but for local people who need a voice. I’m amazed what Cllr Wayne Dixon has achieved and I’m thrilled to join him in making our community a better, cleaner place for us and our families to live.’\nSDP Leader William Clouston said:\n‘I’m delighted that the SDP’s hard work has again won the voters’ trust. It’s another victory for mainstream politics. The people of Leeds can see that we share their values and want the same things – safe neighbourhoods with community spirit.’\n‘SDP Councillors work hard and word is quickly spreading about our distinctive policies on the family, new industry and decent housing. It’s all very encouraging.’\nFor full details on the SDP’s policies, see https://sdp.org.uk/policies/\nEmail: William Clouston leader@sdp.org.uk",

Our country has been badly mis-governed by the establishment parties and political and electoral reform is long overdue. We share a common vision with Richard Tice and his colleagues on how to achieve this.\nIt’s true that the SDP has different ideas to Reform UK on economics and the role of the state but there is sufficient common ground to work together in the national interest. We value our independence but it’s the SDP tradition to work with others.\nWe appreciated Reform UK’s endorsement in the recent South Yorkshire Mayoral election. It makes sense to keep our campaign teams in place and work closely together there.\nI’m very optimistic about our prospects.”\nReform UK Leader Richard Tice added,\n“We have always said that we would be willing to work with the right party. Since day one, the SDP have engaged in grown-up, constructive talks about where and how we might work together to offer a credible challenge to the establishment parties.”\nMr Tice went on to say, “I’m incredibly excited about what we can offer to voters at the next election and would encourage anybody who believes it’s time for change to come and get involved.”",

It’s as simple as that. I believe the UK isn’t broken but the system is. I’m standing for the SDP because we hold values that I believe the British people are looking for from their next government — a sound economy, a socially fair society and safe communities.”\nThe main issues Steve will be campaigning on are:\n- Fighting the ULEZ extension – a stealth tax to make money that will have little environmental impact.\n- Fighting crime through improved pro-active policing.\n- Affordable housing, prioritising local residents.\nWilliam Clouston, Leader of the SDP commented:\n“We’re very proud to have such a strong local candidate as Steve Gardner to fight this important by-election. Steve typifies all that is positive in our party. He’s a local man, a long-standing SDP member – ex-British Army – who is working hard for his community and for his country. We look forward to the campaign.”\nEditor’s Note:\nThe Social Democratic Party, founded in 1981, is a patriotic, economically left- leaning, and culturally traditional political party. Our flagship ‘Social Market’ economic model views the private sector and the public sector not as opponents but as complementary parts of the same society. We believe that individualism has over-stepped. Instead, we focus on what unites and brings society together at the level of the family, community and the nation.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND INTERVIEWS CONTACT SDP LEADER, WILLIAM CLOUSTON:",

It therefore won votes and seats on false pretences.\n“The decision by Mr Corbyn and his shadow cabinet to rip up its promises on Brexit to the British people is a disgusting betrayal. Millions of longtime Labour voters who also voted to leave the EU and were told their party would respect the referendum result have been deceived in the most cynical and disgraceful way.\n“Fortunately for them, there is a fast-growing party in the Social Democrats which believes in ending economic austerity, in asking the wealthy to contribute a little more to the public realm and yet is truly committed to the implementation of the Brexit vote.\n“From this day on there is literally no discernable reason for any Leave supporter or any true democrat even to consider voting Labour. What was born as a party committed to improving the lot of working class British people has completed its transformation into a mouthpiece for the fashionable and privileged liberal-Left elite. Its particular contempt for working class voters in hundreds of pro-leave constituencies across the country is truly shocking to behold.\n“Were such a hostile posture adopted by another party towards an identity group Labour has more sympathy with I have little doubt that Labour figures would be labelling that a ‘hate crime’.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-internet-is-increasingly-crucial-to-day-to-day-life-such-that-some-are-now-suggesting-access-should-be-a-right-josh-sims-takes-a-look-at-the-argument/content_360.html": "The Covid pandemic made one thing very clear: with many people restricted to their homes, an internet connection – for schooling, for work, for medical help, commerce and communication – started to look not like a luxury but vital. The pandemic served to further deepen the digital divide in an increasingly digital society. It’s a taste of things to come: as functioning in society becomes more dependent on connectivity, the unconnected might well feel increasingly digitally disenfranchised.\nBut what if having internet access was considered a right, much as access to water, food or healthcare is widely considered to be? That was a resolution passed by the United Nations in 2016, albeit a non-binding one. Indeed, according to Dr. Jack Barry, research associate at the University of Connecticut’s Center for Public Interest Communications, many of those things already considered rights – equal access to work, for example, is codified in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – are in the real world more and more dependent on internet access: so many job postings are only online now, with job applications only possible online too.\n“The internet has changed to become to main way to communicate, but also a device for work, as a marketplace, as the best way to share ideas and so on, with Covid revealing to governments, organisations and employers alike why they really need people to have internet access at home,” says Barry. “[But] people are also seeing that their other rights – freedom of speech, for example – are not really protected without the right to internet access. And Covid has only emphasised that argument I think. It has exposed the shocking disparities between those with and without access.”\nThis is why some thinkers on the topic have thought of the internet as being more of an auxiliary human right rather than a right in itself – necessary to prevent more fundamental rights from becoming useless.\nWhat of, say, the right to an education, as the Covid era’s remote schooling highlighted? Or the right to participate in elections when so much campaigning is now online, not to mention increased use of online voting? Or of freedom of speech in an era when the internet is considered the de facto public forum? Ukrainian civilians, notes Dr. Merten Reglitz, senior lecturer in global ethics at the University of Birmingham, UK, have been vocal in calling for assistance in the provision of water, food, shelter…and internet access.\nCertainly lack of access may be one problem in fulfilling fundamental rights; access being removed is another. A report last summer from the UN Human Rights Office stresses the negative ramifications of internet shut-downs – governments switching off the national internet infrastructure, banning access or limiting bandwidth. And it’s commonplace: Iran is proving the most topical example, with social media seen as vital to the documentation, organisation and, outside of urban areas, spread of dissent, such that some have claimed the shutdown is an extension of the physical violence taking place. But Iran is not alone: 74 countries enacted 931 shutdowns between 2016 and 2021 – at massive economic cost nationally, and with knock-on effects internationally – particularly during heightened political tensions and often without any official reason given.\nIn other words, the internet is recognised by these countries as a tool of freedom of expression. And they don’t like it. Ironically, shutdowns tend to occur in those less developed countries receiving development aid to increase connectivity. Small wonder too that authoritarian states – Iran, but also China – are keen to develop a national internet over which more pervasive control could be exerted: the so-called ‘splinternet’. Syria has just one, easily manipulated internet provider. But then liberal states have been willing to interfere with the access of private citizens too.\nThat all this matters is, arguably, only the case if a lack of internet access really does limit people in exercising their fundamental rights. And the first in a series of ‘internet deprivation’ studies seems to suggest that it does. The University of Haifa has conducted controlled experiments in which participants (controlled for age, education and technological proficiency) were set challenges – to find out which member of Congress submitted a particular bill, and to express themselves regarding a political topic to a wide audience. One group was allowed to use all available resources, including the internet; the other group was denied internet access. Unsurprisingly, all subjects in the first group used the internet and 89% completed the tasks; only 12% of the internet-deprived group managed to do so.\nCertainly lack of access is a very real problem too: according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), internet penetration rates only passed the 50% mark globally in 2017. And, according to a 2020 UNICEF report, those that do have it, predictably, are those who are wealthier: globally, 58% of the richest households have internet at home, relative to 16% of the poorest households. Mobile telephony likewise remains too expensive for many in the developing world, notably in countries the likes of South Africa, where broadband roll-out has been slow and limited to the most well-off areas.\nBut it’s not that much better in the developed world: half of the US population is not using the internet at broadband speeds, either because of a lack of infrastructure where they are, because the service is too expensive, or because they lack the skills. Five percent have no access at all. Potentially generations are coming up without the skills necessary to thrive in the 21st century: two-thirds of the world’s school-age children have no internet at home, with 63% of 15-24-year-olds also unconnected.\nSmall wonder that the last decade has seen some – albeit not many – countries declare internet access to be a right, Finland and Mexico among them, and take the first steps to make national coverage a reality. Among ideas explored have been repurposing community centres or libraries as free internet access hubs, through to subsidies to buy access at home.\nYet it’s far from clear that policies enacted by some nations over recent years – the likes of President Biden’s Internet for All initiative – are going about solving this problem the right way. For instance, to start with there’s the need for accurate maps of today’s broadband coverage – currently a complex web of pockets. Barry argues that the challenge is less about providing the infrastructure – which by some measures would be cheaper than building a road or sewer network – as providing the devices to access the internet on. Recycling of still functional – if no long cutting-edge or fashionable – devices could provide the solution.\nAnd while the ITU – which in 2019 launched a project with UNICEF to connect every school to the internet – has noted that connecting rural populations is a “formidable challenge”, others have argued that seeking to connect greater swathes of geography is not the right approach. “Where does that stop? Do we run cables out to the most remote villages?” asks Barry. Rather, it’s argued, what’s required is to connect greater numbers of populations.\nMeeting the needs of sparsely populated locations unserved by internet provision would, according to a Tufts University study, come at the expense of serving the needs of those in densely populated urban communities “who live in proximity to the available infrastructure but lack access to affordable broadband”. The study notes the reality is that the broadband gap – in terms of numbers of people affected – is three times greater in urban areas.\nThere is also the problem, it argues, that closing the digital divide requires local solutions, pertinent to the particular community, terrain, and so on. Barry likewise argues that closing the digital divide will only be hampered by taking a binary response – access or no access – rather than seeing the situation as more a question of “gradations of access divide” requiring a suitably multi-faceted response according to language, education, income, available technology and so on.\nAnd, of course, that’s not the only barrier to ensuring that the right to internet access is made a reality. Reframing internet access as a need, rather than a want, will inevitably entail more government regulations (even if, in the US at least, 17 states have laws prohibiting broadband being treated as a public utility). Companies that profit directly from the internet – service providers, notably – might also be expected to lobby hard to minimise government interference. And, further down the line, if internet access does come to be seen as a right, one might in time expect the content of the internet to face review too.\n“We can try to force internet providers to spend some part of their profits on expanding their services, or look to taxing the likes of Google or Facebook to expand it too, seeing as their business relies on the internet,” suggests Reglitz. “The internet has been a kind of wild west today, with many tech companies like Google and Facebook only now starting to recognise [the problems] with their behaviour. But some kind of legal requirement [on these players to act] seems to be the way we’re going now.”\nAnd yet with the move to ‘free’ and ‘ubiquitous’ internet access also come great opportunities, not least the boon to economic activity that may follow: Northwestern University, in the US, says that a 10 percentage point increase in broadband penetration is estimated to increase national GDP by 1.2%. It could also provide the chance to check tech companies’ sharing and monetising of personal data.\n“I don’t think most people even think about whether we should be helping those who don’t have internet access here or abroad to get it,” says Reglitz. “I think people still tend to think of internet access as a luxury – something to watch Netflix on, and yes, it’s that kind of [entertainment function] that most people do use the internet for. But rights are social guarantees against standard threats, in the way that you might have an entitlement to police protection from being assaulted, for example. And, if we’re going to make internet access a right, that needs to come with better protections and some form of minimal entitlements to support for those who need it too.”\nIt should be freely available to everyone but that would mean the state becoming an ISP. Perhaps, there’s a technology that would allow it to be accessed over some long-range connection. Maybe one big antenna on a tall building?",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2021_04_07_steve-kelleher-announced-as-sdp-candidate-for-london-mayor/content_658.html": "7th April, 2021 – The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has announced that Steve Kelleher will run as the party’s candidate to be Mayor of London. This follows the SDP’s recent announcement of David Bettney as its candidate in the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election.\nA native Londoner, Kelleher is the son of Irish immigrants and grew up around the Elephant & Castle. He works in recruitment in the City, is the father of five children and coaches cricket locally in his spare time.\nAs Mayor of London, Kelleher will apply three simple core policies that will work to the benefit of all Londoners. These will be funded through cuts in wasteful overheads identified across the GLA, TfL and the Metropolitan Police.\n- 50,000 NEW COUNCIL HOUSES – The SDP aims for 50,000 new council houses to be built in the capital every year by 2024. In addition, priority access to council housing will be given to those who were born, raised or currently live in a borough.\n- BACK THE POLICE – Policing in London has become both politicised and divorced from the everyday concerns of Londoners. Assertive community foot patrols are the way to both drastically cut crime rates and to start to restore public confidence in the Met. The SDP will aim to increase the number of officers on the beat across the capital by 10,000.\n- FREE PUBLIC TRANSPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE – To help young Londoners better face the cost of living crisis and build their savings, the SDP will make free public transport available to all under-25s for the next three years. Occasional free travel will be made available to anyone who has lived in the capital for five consecutive years.\n“I’m an ordinary person, disaffected by the two party politics that has dominated life in the UK for as long as I can remember,” says SDP London Mayoral candidate Steve Kelleher. “But I’ve seen the fall-out from that most clearly in the city where I’ve lived all my life. And now I want to see positive change. I’ve long struggled to find a party whose policies struck me as coherent, balanced and practicable – but the SDP has those policies. I believe it’s time some common sense was allowed to take root in the way the capital is managed.”\n“London is at a crossroads – in terms of its influence globally, in terms of its standing within the nation, in terms of what makes it work for its hugely diverse yet remarkably cohesive population,” adds William Clouston, leader of the Social Democratic Party. “It’s self-evident that a lack of clear, people-first thinking has consistently led the capital down blind alleys and its people into unnecessary conflict. We need a fresh, more pragmatic approach if London is to retain its vibrancy, creativity and collective spirit.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_primary-purpose-rule-and-its-impact-on-integration/content_164.html": "Having worked for many years on issues of Harmful Traditional Practices, such as honour crimes and forced marriage, I have consistently argued for the need for a robust integration policy, as well as for the return of the Primary Purpose Rule (PPR). In this article I will demonstrate why PPR is essential by drawing on some of my own personal experiences and those of my clients.\nThe PPR was an immigration law that existed between 1983 and 1997 which required immigrants entering the United Kingdom to show that a marriage was not entered into primarily to obtain admission to the UK. Following the 1997 general election, under the then Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Primary Purpose Rule was abolished. This made marriage with someone settled in the UK solely for the purposes of obtaining citizenship possible. The scrapping of PPR resulted in an increase in spousal immigration, including forced marriages.\nIn 2009, Migration Watch reported that following the abolition of PPR in 1997 spousal immigration increased by 50%. At the time, when the abolition of the rule was being debated, those in favour of scrapping the rule were outraged by the mere mention of the increased risk of forced marriages from those who supported the victims of such practice. However, in 2019, the Forced Marriage Unit’s annual report revealed that only 5% of the cases they worked on had absolutely no overseas element at all; a trend held every year since the Forced Marriage Unit started collecting figures.\nDiscussions about immigration are often viewed through the prism of race and or ethnicity, disregarding the impact of large-scale migration on 2nd, 3rd , and 4th generation migrants. The combination of mass migration and the lack of a robust integration policy has not only disadvantaged British working-class communities, but also children of migrants born in Britain. The fact that certain communities have attempted to utilise their children to assist the migration of family and community members has created further issues in British society. The scrapping of PPR saw a simultaneous rise in both forced and arranged marriages, whereby young people were coerced into assisting the residency claims of their relatives.\nChildren born to some migrant families are seldom given permission to integrate into the wider community and often held back by their own families. Early migrants indeed faced racism and bigotry that following generations did not. I heard about this from my own grandparents who came to Britain from Pakistan in the early 1960s. Sadly, they used their negative experiences to prevent my father from fully engaging with the wider British community – a pattern I have noted within Pakistani diaspora communities through my work over the years.\nI have often thought that my father, who was born and raised in the UK, would have been a completely different man had he been permitted to marry a partner of his choosing and allowed to live how he wished. Unfortunately, at the age of 18 my father was coerced into marrying one of his young relatives from Pakistan.\nDue to this union two very different worlds collided. Two young people unprepared for adult life were forced into a lifelong union that they were ill prepared for. Neither party understood the world of their new spouse.\nPrior to their marriage my father liked to listen to heavy metal, wear leather, and ride motorbikes; just like many other young English lads of his age. Conversely, my mother had only known the fields of rural Pakistan whence she came. In a similar manner to my grandparents, in the new unfamiliar world she clung to what remained familiar: her culture and her faith. Two worlds unable to understand each other and never able to fully settle with one another.\nMarrying children young and burdening them with the responsibilities that accompany marriage was (and in some cases still is) a method of control. Furthermore, marrying the following generations of children and young people to someone from the country of their families’ origin is a method of socio-cultural segregation, preventing them from socialising outside of their ethnic milieu.\nThis issue doesn’t just impact the children of migrants, but also the children born of mixed unions such as my parents, where one is Britain-born and the other is of a different nationality. With many of the clients I have supported I have witnessed a pattern of deeply unhappy families. One issue of contention, which I hear frequently cited, is the inability to understand each other’s perspective, often leading to painful and protracted conflicts.\nWithin these unions it is not just the couples that find communicating with one another difficult; the children also struggle to communicate with their parents. In the case of my family, my mother never really understood her sons and daughters who were all more westernised and secular than she could ever tolerate. Though my father understood, he was under continual pressure from both his parents and my mother to uphold the family and community traditions that were alien to him. He was pressured to do to his children what had been done to him.\nAs British society has adapted to become more open and accepting of difference, members of diaspora communities born in the UK are more easily able to interact and engage with the wider community. This can distance them from the values of their parents and foreign-born spouses and is frequently a source of conflict between generations. My father was very different from his wife and parents, as were my siblings and I. My mother felt lost and alienated from the values of her own family. We children could never comprehend her unwillingness to understand our worldviews.\nFirst generation migrants sometimes import archaic parenting styles, often stricter, and sometimes more violent. Having come from a nation where physical chastisement is more widely practiced, our mother never shied away from physical abuse. Though our father was not as violent, he often stood at the side-lines whilst the beatings occurred.\nAs we grew older, my siblings and I understood that both of our parents were incredibly young when they were themselves coerced into their challenging union. We often reached out to them, appealing to our bonds of mutual kinship, but unfortunately their filial affections were contingent upon compliance with their narrow worldviews.\nWhilst some diaspora communities, such as ethnic Indians, have more successfully integrated into British society, other migrant communities, such as Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, have tended to grow more insular. The burden of bringing ever more family members to Britain is passed down the generations, creating more unstable homes and detached communities. Young people all too often face a catch-22 situation; comply with parental instructions to marry overseas relatives or lose all domestic family and community connections.\nMany children of Pakistani and Bangladeshi migrants are all too often treated with contempt by their families if they are not seen to be sufficiently traditional in an ethno-religious sense. This is usually expressed as a sense of betrayal towards their ancestral lineage, nation, faith and ethnicity. They are expected to pledge allegiance to the home nations of their parents rather than form an affiliation with their nation of residence. Families tell their children they will never be English and that they must retain the identity of their antecedents. This dilemma is often worsened when they return to the lands of their families’ provenance, where they are also told that they don’t belong.\nThe growing trend of the politicisation of identity is yet another factor behind the splintering of selfhood and community. Where political capital is made out of cultural difference, contempt is all too frequently meted out towards ethnic minorities that don’t behave in a manner perceived to be culturally authentic. The cost of attempting to integrate can be racism from cultural relativists or ostracism from families and communities that children of migrants have grown up with.\nEarlier migrants tended to be more successful in amalgamating into wider society. This is in part because they married outside of their extended kinship, and religious and ethnic circles; but also because they lived alongside and interacted more frequently with British natives. Today in some diaspora communities you can pass your whole life without interacting with anybody from the wider British population.\nWe need a return of the PPR as part of a robust integration system which facilitates both inter-community and intergenerational cohesion, whilst allowing the descendants of migrant families to settle into the nation and find their feet.\nA very thoughtful piece. Thank you Sadia.\nI didn’t know about this. What you write makes a lot of sense.\nPlenty of immigrants are a credit to Britain but We cannot continue to allow vast amounts of people into the Country\nThank you Sadia, this is a superb addition to our understanding of an important aspect of our multicultural society. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on any links you see between the issues you identify and the incidence of domestic terrorism and the kind of child sexual abuse we’ve seen in places such as Rotherham. These things tend to be viewed through the prism of religious alienation rather the kind of familial alienation you describe.\nA brilliant article and a sad indictment of the mess that “multiculturaliam”has created\nI thoroughly agree with your wish to return PPR and the reasons why. Integration has been ignored for ever. I married a Muslim with a large extended family from Uganda. I saw that the teenage boys and some men had suffered prejudice in the locality. Fortunately my family were not like that. His family did all they could to stop our marriage but reluctantly accepted it in a limited way. Mischief went on behind my back which I was aware of and was very careful what I said in the family. My parents were not given the respect that was demanded of me for their parents. They did not mix with British natives at all unless it was for business purposes. When their children wanted mixed marriages, their parents broke them up. I admired their business acumen but their attitudes to women and parenting were not healthy. Whilst scorning white women particularly, I found the disrespect by the men for women was unacceptable, and did stand up for the women sometimes. This in the end caused the end of the marriage as I stopped a brother-in-law from raping his niece, tore up pornographic magazines and told the women to report who did it, reported incest to the police and generally became a massive pest. This made the family resort to marrying girls from Pakistan who they felt they could dominate so they wouldn’t give trouble as I had done. They had many divorces as a result, although one or two stuck at it. Things have changed and everyone needs to catch up, reach out and integrate.\nAn eye opening article for sure. Hope more virtue-signalling, race baiting, faux Liberals read this. Racializing every issue has its unintended consequences.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_dane-gold-how-to-raise-more-tax-and-get-away-with-it/content_82.html": "‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark’, Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet.\nFree marketeers would no doubt agree given how much the country raises in tax – an eye-watering 44.5% of GDP last year, compared to the United Kingdom’s 33.5%.\nIf the UK’s tax-to-GDP ratio was at Danish levels the Exchequer could generate an extra £220 billion per year in tax revenues.\nYet Denmark’s economy has not suffered from this. Denmark’s GDP-per-capita (the best measure of economic success) is around US$10,000 higher than the UK’s, while growth rates and unemployment have broadly matched ours in recent decades.\nRecent research led by the economist Henrik Kleven has identified five key reasons why Denmark has, in many ways, managed to ‘square the circle’ of sustaining a high tax-to-GDP ratio while not harming overall prosperity.\n- The Danish tax system has widespread third-party information reporting and extensive and well-established ‘paper trails’ that the tax authorities can rely upon to identify and verify taxable activity.\n- Taxes are levied on a broad basis. Allowances, exemptions, deductions and other distortions are minimised. Broader and simpler taxes reduce the scope for tax to distort the economic decisions of individuals and businesses.\n- Sizeable amounts of tax revenues are spent on subsidising or providing services which complement working, like transport services, education and training, active labour market policies and child and adult social care. This reduces the potential for ‘poverty traps’ and helps to keep labour market participation high.\n- Around two-thirds of the marginal income tax rate paid by Danes is set locally. This local income tax surcharge is supported by other local taxes such as a municipal land value-based tax. Local taxes engender a clear connection between revenue raising and expenditure.\n- High-levels of social capital (in other words levels of trust and mutuality) mean that Danes are generally willing to pay taxes at the rates that they do.\nIn the fiscal year 2018/19, United Kingdom Government spent £39 billion more than its revenue. Before the coronavirus hit, the 2019/20 forecast was for borrowing of more than £40 billion.\nHowever significant other demands are pressing on the public purse. Health and social care as the population ages is an obvious one. We might also identify ameliorating the housing crisis, the persistent under-spending on education (especially vocational education), the long-running chronic funding shortage that has afflicted defence for many years; also spending on the police, justice and UK’s borders.\nThe prospect of sustainably funding any, never mind all, of these seems remote in the present environment.\nDenmark’s offers a clearly successful alternative example.\nA social democratic Government could, over a series of Budgets, re-design the tax system in order to maximise the role of third parties and the flow of information about taxable activities. Reform would also need to broaden the tax base, reducing to the barest minimum the number of exemptions, allowances and write-offs that permeate the current system, and simplify the system to minimise tax-induced behavioural distortions.\nThere is also no good reason why significant fiscal devolution could not be implemented. Some of the revenues raised would need to be spent on public services that complement labour market participation. Other measures such as improving tax auditing and strengthening anti-avoidance measures (now possible because the UK has left the EU, which inhibits the efforts of tax authorities) could further shore up the tax base.\nVested interests would fight such a programme tooth and nail. We would also need some redistribution to compensate those on lower incomes who would be negatively impacted by broadening the tax base in the short-term.\nNevertheless, Denmark’s example shows that, if social democrats want to replenish the public purse and use the collective power of the state to boost our health, wellbeing and safety, it can be done.\nThis makes sense, I think, but I would add two other considerations:\nFirst, public expenditure must be visibly efficient, prudent and necessary. Today, that is often very questionable.\nSecondly, large corporations which derive significant revenues from the UK must pay taxes broadly commensurate with their activity. This is essential to regain trust in the tax system. If necessary, we should consider assessing tax based on reasonable margin/revenue assumptions and denying offshore intangible and “service” expenses.\nI agree with the article and the comments below, particularly Amazon’s minuscule tax payments for example, but the Government must also tackle the rampant money laundering by the banks in the City and the concomitant offshore tax evasion that demonstrates to the populace generally how unfair the present system is. With an enormous financial crisis about to engulf us, there is no time to be lost.\nI agree with Mr. Baglin’s comments, especially the ridiculously favourable treatment afforded to Amazon and Apple, for example, and would add that the Government MUST tackle the rampant money laundering by the banks in the City and the concomitant tax evasion using British colonies and other offshore countries/entities. The public is well aware of the unfair treatment that they are receiving, compared with large financial institutions, who have almost all been bailed out by the taxpayer in recent years. With a financial tsunami about to engulf the UK, there is no time to be lost.\nI strongly agree with William Beckett. The SDP needs to make ensuring the multinationals and finance sector paying their tax a central plank of its policy. Without this all economic strategy will fail.\nanyone who thinks the useless Tories or Starmer’s Red Tories will go after their Friends in the City are deluded there is a real opportunity for the SDP to become an alternative to the 3 tired old parties\nThis is a very interesting article. I am not sure if this would work in this country though. People want good public services but do not want to pay for them. I would like to see a ring fenced tax for the NHS, Adult Social Care and Pensions. I believe that people would be prepared to properly fund this if they could see a demonstrable link with looking after their health needs and to fund their later year provision. This is what National Insurance used to be.\nI certainly agree with a turnover tax on companies to avoid the blatant avoidance of paying their fair share.\nOn a local level let’s scrap the iniquitous rate system and establish a local income tax or a sales tax to fund good quality local services. I would even advocate a tourist tax. It seems unfair that visitors can enjoy all local services without any direct contribution",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_new-cold-war-oil-shock-stagflation/content_54.html": "Stagflation and End-of-Policy-Days\nThe world economy is broken, and not to be restored quickly or easily. Policy-initiatives will, needs must, be aimed at fostering elements of autarkic national independence. International flows of goods, services, labour and capital will wither, and national governmental policy interventions will narrow the space within which the market will be allowed to work its magic. Getting reliable supplies of food and power will be categorical imperatives which will over-ride projects soon to be discovered to be vanities. The fallout hits first and hardest in Europe, but will necessarily spread around the rest of the world.The architecture of our times crumbled this week, and it will take years, possibly decades, before a new modus vivendi compatible with progress towards widespread prosperity is realised. In effect, Russia’s disastrous invasion of Ukraine, coupled with Ukraine discovering beyond doubt its modern foundational national myth, means the de-globalisation which has been evident for the best part of a decade is thrown into warp-drive hyper-speed. Separately, the supply chain disruptions which are at the heart of current inflation have been escalated in ways which are probably even more extreme than the Oil Crisis of the 1970s.\nIt is, I suppose, possible that the next couple of weeks will allow a post-Putin Russia to find a way to restore their membership of the recognisably investible community of economic counterparties. But it is just as likely that the despot will start throwing nukes or chemical/bioweapons around in a way which ushers in a new Dark Age for all of us.\nThe immediate future for Europe, and probably everywhere else as well, is stagflation, as the rise in commodity prices (energy, food, industrial commodities) ‘taxes’ households and businesses into a contraction which can do little quickly to deal with the global sources of inflation. On the surface, stagflation’s rebirth might seem merely the result of several ‘black swan’ accidents happening at once. But the severe difficulties it raises for policy-makers also signals that stagflation is a phenomenon which accompanies the exhaustion of prevailing economic policy nostrums and approaches.\nLast year, in ‘The Wrong Super-Cycle’ I wrote: ‘The real super-cycle the current [commodity] price rises are telling us about is the belated end of the financial industry super-cycle which was initiated when Paul Volcker arrived at the Fed determined to tackle inflation. The result was a generations-long uninterrupted bond bull market which reached its natural peak around the turn of the century, and extended through to around 2010, ironically by responses to the multiple crises actually generated by the end of the cycle. The final extension has been granted only by the utterly unprecedented impact of a global pandemic, which has left central banks as the main supporters of government bond markets. The last buyer is in mid-buying climax.’\nBut never in my worst nightmares did I consider the end would come so abruptly and violently.\nThe quandary for policymakers is obvious:\n- raise interest rates to crush inflation, and you trigger a dramatic recession with an accompanying financial-market meltdown;\n- keep monetary policy super-accommodating, and watch ‘cost-push’ inflation morph into the full wage/price spiral of money-value destruction.\nWithin the currently accepted framework for economic-policymaking, this dilemma cannot be finessed. The result will be a make-over of the policymaking framework, but who knows how long it will take us to get there?\nThe danger is that the immediate response will be to re-play the moves which ended the last bout of stagflation. But because our contemporary set of accepted economic truths and policy-nostrums were born directly of that stagflationary experience and have now reached their own stagflationary end-point, doubling down on those nostrums would be – must be – the wrong response.\nStagflation – Last Time\nIt pays to remember the circumstances which ignited stagflation the last time. I shall use the British experience as the exemplar.\nSince the early 1960s, the policy watchword was ‘demand management’, which essentially meant expanding the fiscal deficit in order to make up any expected or actual shortfall in private demand – and thus to ensure GDP growth, and employment, was maintained. The corollary was national economic planning implemented by industrial and labour policy. In particular, this meant that the unions were involved in setting up the national plan, and helping with its implementation via keeping workers’ demands under control even as inflation rose. In practice, it was a recipe for keeping political struggle contained within the walls of No10, and things being settled through deals we would now see as corrupt. Industrial inefficiency was masked and indulged by industrial and labour policy. This was unavoidably noticeable in those swathes of industry which were under union/government control/influence, but the widespread regime of labour subsidies meant it was widespread even in notionally private industries.\nThe underlying deal had been unravelling quietly for some time when the oil shock hit in late 1973. It was large enough to derail government/union deals, with ‘wildcat’ pay-strikes blossoming as people tried to maintain their standard of living in the face of rampant inflation.\nThe policy board was bare, and increasingly bereft attempts to tamp down the solution whilst buying off discontent led to Britain’s bankruptcy in 1976. The IMF’s rescue package and an interim attempt at austerity ultimately produced the ‘winter of discontent’ where, famously, no rubbish was collected, the dead went unburied, and the lights went out. Bliss was it in those days to be alive.\nIt did, however, herald the way for the eventual overthrow of the ‘demand management’ economic policy approach, and the arrival of a new policy-settlement. It has subsequently been christened the arrival of ‘neo-classical’ economics, but, of course, that hardening of the academic arteries was achieved only in hindsight to describe a partial and chaotic rebuilding of Britain’s entire political economy. At the time, the policy solution was seen to have two main components. First, inflation was broken by massively ramping interest rates and controlling money supply, at the cost of massive unemployment. Second, and equally important, the ‘unions were broken’, and consequently the ability of workers to fight for higher wages was destroyed. (Revealing, among other things, how ludicrous is it to believe that wages are set simply by supply and demand, rather than by adjusting the political/economic setup.)\nStagflation – This Time\nIt should be plain that the stagflation we are about to endure is breaking out in circumstances utterly unlike those which fostered it in the 1970s.\nThis time, the stagflation comes about because of broken supply chains extending well beyond oil and gas, as the age of globalisation is dismantled across a shockingly broad landscape, encompassing not just oil but many industrial commodities, food, labour, investment and financial flows.\nOn top of which, of course, the West has also opted for various restrictions on activity (consumption, investment, saving) in its Green Theatre productions, featuring its absurdist ‘net zero’ pageant. The problem is that this Green Theatre has done nothing substantial to address a genuinely serious problem, is doing nothing to address it, and will/can do nothing to address it. It is not that the problem is not serious, it is that Green Theatre solutions are not. We may lament it, but should not deny it: the pace of rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations has not even been slowed.\nThe current threat of stagflation has nothing to do with labour militancy, and comes at a time when monetary policy and fiscal policy are both extremely extended, so have little scope for being accommodating. And since the current inflation is not fundamentally about ‘too much demand’, it is doubtful that anything but a really, really deep recession would chase inflation away.\nMoreover, if the current threat of stagflation is not fundamentally about excess but rather a sudden and unavoidably irreparable collapse in supply-chains and supply-systems, neither fiscal nor monetary tightening would be an efficient or even logical way to deal with the problem.\nStagflation 2020s – Possible Policy Approaches\nWhat, then, would be a sensible approach to stagflation this time? Quite simply, because the underlying problem is a lack of supply, the policy emphasis should be on accepting/encouraging lowered consumption and using the savings surplus generated to finance sufficient investment spending to avoid recession. Only a savings/investment led growth mix can help us out of this stagflation. The investment spending will be needed in order to deal with the various supply-shortage issues which we now encounter. Most obviously, massive investment will be needed to overhaul energy infrastructures in the short (gas, fracking, coal) and longer terms (small modular nuclear reactors). Government subsidies will probably be needed to blunt the impact of rocketing fertiliser prices on food-production. But this increased investment spending, which will necessarily involve substantial public sector involvement, will need to be financed as far as possible from household and business sector savings, rather than simply central bank largesse.\nAn economic model which accepts lower consumption spending in the short term, but offsets this through broad-scale policy efforts to encourage investment spending, may in time limit the damage to GDP growth whilst discovering a way out of the trap of stagflation.\nIf this involves such policy throwbacks as an active industrial policy and an active attempt to encourage the public (that is to say, households, not banks) to buy government debt, then so be it. A throwback it is. But so is a Cold War and an Oil Crisis all in one.\nFirst published on Michael Taylor’s substack, Coldwater Economics, March 6th 2022.\nThere are plenty of people out there who say that much of the current bout of inflation is brought on buy the QE that the BoE engaged in during the pandemic. Is that entirely wrong? If it is partially right, wouldn’t monetary tightening provide at least some help in addressing inflation?\nMeanwhile, less consumption spending and more investment is surely a good thing for our economy…but less consumption spending is a tough sell politically. How on earth do you get the political mandate to do it?\nThis Country is crying out for alternative leadership not offer by the 3 failed Old parties the sdp could be that alternative Government Johnson is a fraud and Starmer is woeful",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-global-britain-delusion/content_162.html": "Some nations are more sovereign than others. Self-determination and flag waving only gets you so far until Russia turns off your gas, which is why “Take Back Control” won more votes than anything before or since. Communities scarred by deindustrialisation wanted real control, a strong standing army, jobs brought back, and order at the border. Boris knew it, he capitalised on it at the election, and won a landslide.\nIt was no accident that Boris canvassed alongside Gisela Stuart in Sunderland, committing to state aid. By and large, in the seats that abandoned Labour, there was an expectation that fishing would boom, factories would reopen, and wages would rise.\nPerhaps we ought not to be surprised that Boris Johnson would confound expectations and go back on his commitments. Yet somehow, I do find myself surprised by the speed of the UK’s Kafkaesque metamorphosis into the fabled Singapore-on-Thames, more digestibly known as “Global Britain”.\nThe (re)emergence of Global Britain\nThere were warning signs. The UK-Vietnam deal had the whiff of grapeshot about it. In it we agreed (or more precisely, Liz Truss agreed) that tariffs on a swathe of Vietnamese exports would be wiped out. Then came the real blow, the Australia deal.\nIn her eagerness to score a PR win, Truss signed a deal that confounded even the Aussies’ best expectations. In fifteen years, all tariff and quota protections on British beef will be yielded, and this to a nation whose advantage is so absolute not even the US will trade their beef freely. This ‘deal’ is a surrender document which heralds devastation for farmers. But then we will be able to eat Tim Tams, so there is that.\nWhat began as tragedy is now descending into a farce. There is now a recommendation by the government’s Trade Remedy Authority that protections on fifty percent of British steel be dropped, including on steel used for the production of Royal Navy ships.\nThe TRA’s mission statement is to “help defend UK economic interests from unfair international trading practices.” Clearly, it seems that the TRA has forgotten its own mission in pursuit of this new Global Britain. Luckily, the Prime Minister has resisted this latest siren call from free-trade ideologues, but whether he can continue to keep himself tied to the mast is anybody’s guess.\nIt could be that the Cabinet are suffering from a bout of Covid-induced amnesia. Evidently, they have forgotten the lessons of Thatcherite deindustrialisation, whose spectre returned to haunt us when our weakened manufacturing and chemicals industries failed to make ventilators or produce tests in our hour of need.\nWhat’s worse though is their apparent and alarming short-term forgetfulness regarding one of the greatest successes to emerge from this mess: namely, the vaccine rollout. Onshore manufacturing paid dividends in saved lives, and now looks to bring soft power as we move to become a vaccine exporter.\nA tale of Tory hubris\nIf not the result of amnesia, then the government’s actions must surely be hubris. Global Britain seems the brainchild of a Conservative party stuck in the early 20th century.\nIt is a fact to say that our steelworkers, our farmers, and our fisherman cannot compete in the global marketplace, particularly against third world countries with a propensity to dump their produce. Nor should they have to.\nBritain has the second cheapest food in the world, a viable steel industry, and thousands of miles of coastline. We didn’t spend two hundred years fighting for rights in the workplace only to be pitted against Communist regimes.\nYet that insulation is being stripped in a Faustian pact that would see our economy further concentrated in the City of London. The inevitable result of abandoning these tariff and quota defences is unemployment, and the undermining of our strategic capabilities. When the next crisis comes, let’s not pretend to be surprised about our chronic lack of preparation.\nThe Prime Minister won his mandate not by promising to spike our own guns, but by promising to level them up. That mandate was awarded by millions of Red Wall voters, whose communities were decimated by the kind of policy now being pursed in their name. Liz Truss has the brass neck to claim that her Norway deal, which to the delight of Norwegians dropped protections against fishing imports, would be good for Grimsby.\nThe truth is that by dismantling our protections, this government is not taking back control, but giving it away. Sell-out deals which would make retirees of our farmers don’t strengthen us, they kneecap us. If we had a viable opposition, these mad axemen might not be so easily able to finish what Thatcher started. But the so-called opposition, Labour, would at the first opportunity re-shackle us to the failing European Union.\nSo, it’s a choice between a Tory party, whose idea of levelling up involves banning fracking and making pensioners replace their boilers, and a Labour party who are fighting tooth and nail against British coal, unconcerned as they are by our dependence on Putin’s Russia for fuel.\nDitching the delusion\nThe levelling up agenda is not quite as hollow as the Northern Powerhouse, or the long-term economic plan. The new Gigafactory in Sunderland was secured through government investment, for example. But we need another seven, and fast. The green industrial revolution remains a mirage on the horizon, while here and now bread and butter strategic industries are being gutted. Both major parties know the price of everything yet understand the value of nothing.\nWhile trade should be positively encouraged, it must be conducted on a level playing field and with nations and people’s whose standards are in line with our own. The reality is that the government knows full well that British workers cannot compete with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. They know that farmers will go under, as they fight against imports of hormone treated beef.\nBut they don’t care. We’ll get some wind farms, a high street fund, and a Freeport to pacify us, but the aim of the game here is to export and expand financial services. Global Britain is a dangerous fantasy, and those of us who lent our votes need to speak up before we suffer the consequences of entertaining it for too long.\nMario has a point I cannot believe why Johnson is still in office he must go he must go now I think the public are beginning to suss Johnson and what he is all about and that is himself He is doing enormous damage to this Country With the hugely successful vaccination program we should not continue with the idiotic Covid19 restrictions, normality must return but protecting the vulnerable also from Covid19, and what’s Labour doing to offer Britons an alternative Government nothing it’s imperative that the social democratic party progresses and offers an alternative to 5 more years of awful Conservative or Labour misrule the sdp must support growing calls for a federalized Britain with a codified written constitution and hopefully a Republic We must get rid of Johnson and his 2nd rate cabinet and Starmers Labour rabble\nSo we should of just stayed in the EU then ? I voted out and I do regret it now. Brexit seems like a total waste of time and effort. It’s ripped the country apart for nothing it seems. Great article !\nI voted to leave and would vote leave again if there was another referendum I don’t trust Johnson at all I hope we can get rid of him sooner rather than in 2024 he is incompetent his government is full of 2nd rate dopes, but the EU’s future is uncertain\nI agree that the Tories are an utter shambles and their “levelling up” agenda is not achieving anything, but trade barriers are not the answer. One of the few things that economists from around the world agree on is that countries that dismantle inbound/outbound trade barriers end up benefitting. Consumers get more choice and better value. Trade barriers favour producers, not consumers. Safety and quality standards are important and should not be diluted, but they should be used as a “floor”, not a “wall”. In terms of food, the UK has much bigger problems than hormone beef or chlorinated chicken – upwards of 30% of people are significantly overweight.\nAnd I agree that there needs to be more focus on supporting industries where we could become global players in the future, creating jobs and prosperity and contributing to global change – green energy, advanced materials, artificial intelligence for a start.\nThis is the worst government in my lifetime led by a dishonest buffoon who should of never been allowed anywhere near public office, the only reason the Tories have been in office since 2010 is because the utter awfulness of Labour from Blair to Starmer, the sdp should up the ante and offer the British people a real alternative to another dreadful Tory or Labour government We deserve better than Johnson or Starmer I would not even contemplate rejoining the EU it’s in real trouble whether we left or stayed, we need a new administration in charge yes Covid19 is in retreat but without Johnson holding us back we could emerge from Covid19 faster I am glad to have joined the sdp in April 2020 and renewed this year\nVery interesting points made however it is vital and should be made as a key SDP policy to withdraw from NATO, if Britain wants to stay out of conflicts that only serve globalist and foreign interests.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2022_04_04_david-bettney-announced-as-sdp-candidate-for-south-yorkshire-mayor/content_333.html": "4th April 2022 – The Social Democratic Party (SDP) today announces David Bettney as the party’s candidate for South Yorkshire Mayor.\nDavid is a former solider who served in the Army for 22 years, which included tours in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. David grew up on a Council estate in South Yorkshire and, after joining the Army as a Trooper at the age of 17, rose through the ranks to eventually become a Regimental Sergeant Major in the Light Dragoons. Since leaving the Army over a decade ago David has become a serial entrepreneur in the oil and gas industry, having built several construction, logistics and storage companies from the ground-up in the Middle East.\nDavid offers voters in South Yorkshire the opportunity to vote for the the SDP – the fastest growing political party in Britain – a party which is patriotic and is determined to re-build Britain’s industrial and manufacturing base.\nDavid Bettney says:\n“My priority is to boost skills training for young people. Our bloated university sector needs to be slimmed down. Instead, greater investment is needed in apprenticeships and vocational skills – urgently required to re-build our industrial base. We need real jobs to produce real things.\nI will also clean up South Yorkshire’s towns and cities and select flagship historic sites for regeneration. Homelessness and street begging shames our society. I will urgently establish a Taskforce to develop secure hostels for rough sleepers.”\nWilliam Clouston, Leader of the SDP says:\n“Voters in South Yorkshire have the opportunity to elect David Bettney as Mayor – a candidate who not only shares their values but offers an economic plan which serves their interests. The Labour Conservative duopoly has gutted British industry and it’s urgent we re-build it. In David they have a genuinely local candidate who has built business from scratch and who has the energy and vision to see projects through.\nWe are also delighted that David’s candidacy for South Yorkshire Mayor has received the formal endorsement of Reform UK, formerly The Brexit Party. I have thanked Reform UK’s leader Richard Tice for his kind offer of support in this campaign.\nWhilst proudly independent, it’s in the tradition of the Social Democratic Party to work with parties with similar aims. Our economic policies differ but the SDP shares Reform UK’s commitment to political renewal, fair voting and to a Britain which governs itself. We hope that the South Yorkshire Mayoral election will be the first step – the foundation – of greater future cooperation between the SDP and Reform UK.”",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_surveillance-culture-sophistication-take-back-our-privacy/content_382.html": "“It’s absolutely false to think that we in democratic countries have it any different to China,” insists Frederic Lemieux. “The only difference is that China is open about about what it does and we have a more layered, subtle approach. Governments say they’re not bad but the fact is that they have access to everything if they want it. Frankly it’s hard to grasp the scope of the surveillance apparatus today.”\nLemieux is a professor at Georgetown University, US, specialising in information technology, and he uses a virtual private network. He avoids Zoom and social media, has “privacy settings through the roof” and is only ‘friends’ online with people he’s met several times in person. He watches what he says in emails. He won’t wear a smartwatch. And he is not remotely paranoid.\nJust look, he says, at the mobile surveillance spyware Pegasus – technically illegal in the US. And yet the FBI has just been caught out, forced to cancel its arrangement with a government contractor that used the tool on its behalf. It’s the latest instance of an abuse of power – and the data breaches that underscore it – that are, it seems, uncovered somewhere around the world every few months. Many more, one can only assume, are not. “So am I hopeful of some correction to this surveillance culture?” says Lemieux. “No.”\nPerhaps this culture has been a long-time coming. After all, the idea of systematic surveillance is not new. The Panopticon was the name given to an ideal prison devised by philosopher Jeremy Bentham in 1787. In it, every prisoner would – as an encouragement to improved behaviour – be observable without ever knowing if they were being observed. It would, as Bentham put it, create a “sense of invisible omniscience”. And, he added, more darkly: “Ideal perfection would require that each person should actually be in that predicament, during every instant of time. This being impossible, the next thing to be wished for is, that, at every instant, seeing reason to believe as much, and not being able to satisfy himself to the contrary, he should conceive himself to be so.”\nIn Bentham’s time, this was no more than a thought experiment. Today the situation is very different. As the tech entrepreneur Maciej Ceglowski put it to a US Senate committee in 2019, “until recently, even people living in a police state could count on the fact that the authorities didn’t have enough equipment or manpower to observe everyone, everywhere”. Now, it seems, it looks as though they “enjoyed more freedom from monitoring then than we do living in a free society today.”\nIt’s easy to see why. The aforementioned spyware, with advanced processing power, can now collate, save and analyse truly awesome quantities of data; increasingly prevalent CCTV has morphed into often erratic facial-recognition technology and biometrics, including the unevidenced idea that people’s emotional state can be read through their physical appearance; drones have provided ‘eyes in the sky’; digital currencies – actively being promoted in many nations as a stepping stone to doing away with cash – will allow the tracking of all financial transactions; so-called ‘smart cities’ sees the mass deployment of intrusive sensors to monitor citizens supposedly with the intention of improving the urban environment; and there’s ever more wearable tech, RFID tags, GPS dots and the growing Internet of Things all coalescing to provide anyone sufficiently well-resourced with a detailed picture of what once was considered private.\n“But then we have also become largely indifferent to matters of privacy,” stresses sociologist Dr. Gary Armstrong, author of ‘The Maximum Surveillance Society’. “Generation Facebook/Tik-Tok/Instagram have a different perception of privacy than my generation – over 60s – and think nothing of self-revelation and self-promotion. As it stands the state knows less about me than, say, supermarket chains do.”\nHow so? Invariably because the greatest tool in the snoop’s armoury is, as Lemieux puts it, “our own complicity”. We let Alexa listen and Ring Video doorbells watch. We sign up to loyalty schemes. And, given that some 86% of the world’s population, and growing, now owns a smartphone, it seems we willingly carry the means of our own monitoring with us. Indeed, David Lyon, director of the Surveillance Studies Centre and professor of sociology and law at Queen’s University, Ontario, argues that while CCTV might remain the most powerful symbol of surveillance, to still think of it as the most powerful means of surveillance is way out of date. That’s the gadget in our own pocket – our self-imposed, frantically upgraded, style-conscious ankle monitors. He calls the result ‘dataveillance’, our supervision and assessment through a melding of state and corporate interests.\n“And that’s been mutating and accelerating at a rapid rate,” he says. Lyon cites a recent case in Canada in which a user of the ordering app from the coffee chain Tim Hortons put in a ‘freedom of information’ request about its function, only to discover that, even when he thought he had disabled it, the app had continued to track him wherever he went, recording when he visited one of the company’s competitors.\nWhat he still didn’t grasp, however, was “the other uses that data was undoubtedly put to, being sold to and among other corporations and institutions in what has become a globally-significant economic system,” says Lyon. “It’s not just about being tracked but analysed, and then treated according to the profile then created and from which all kinds of judgements are made – by employers, healthcare providers, banks, insurers, law enforcement. The thing is that most people just don’t get that this is even happening.”\nSmall wonder then that when the public reaction to surveillance is discussed it is, at best, rather muted, not least because, as Lyon puts it, “we’ve become seduced [through our smartphones] by the idea of the world organised around our needs, living in a very consumerist society in which efficiency, convenience and comfort have been elevated into core values” – ‘luxury surveillance’ as it has been dubbed. And even if we give it some thought, our rationalisations justifying our acceptance of surveillance tend to be misguided, adds Juan Lindau, professor of political science at Colorado College, US, and author of ‘Surveillance and the Vanishing Individual’.\nPeople dismiss the encroachment of surveillance because, they say, they have nothing to hide – “but it’s a bullshit notion that they wouldn’t mind if every detail of their life was out there for all to see,” Lindau notes. Or they say they’re too irrelevant to be of interest – “but if you ever do anything of even remote political consequence then you’re immediately not irrelevant to the state,” he adds. Or there’s the argument that any one personal revelation is now merely lost in a giant sea of revelations and so doesn’t matter.\n“But its evil brilliance is that tech gives the veneer of distance and [us the sense of] anonymity that is entirely fictitious,” he says. “It is not impersonal. We spend our lives now interacting with machines that observe all, that never forget and never forgive, such that the delineation between our inner and outer selves is [breaking down] by stealth.”\nIt’s also because thinking seriously about the boundaries for surveillance is relatively new – before the seismic revelations of Edward Snowden, 10 years ago this year, much concern about surveillance was dismissed as so much conspiracy thinking, argues Professor Peter Fussey, an expert in criminology at the University of Essex. That, and because much of the surveillance apparatus is, governments so often argue, for our own safety – that’s the line Myanmar has taken in the junta’s crackdown in protests – or for more effective, worryingly ‘proactive’, increasingly militarised crime prevention.\nThat’s concerning when, as Armstrong argues, we’re well on out way to systems that look for the potentially suspicious or merely inappropriate. “Doing that requires a database of both known and potential offenders. And such schemes are always sold on the benefits of apprehending these known offenders,” he says. “But these schemes are expansionist and soon develop databases of ‘people of interest’ too”.\nBut it’s also concerning when national emergencies are used to bring in more surveillance and tend to see subsequent spikes in favour of its expansion. A TNS poll conducted in 2014 – thirteen years after the world-changing events of 9/11, but also not long after Snowden – found that 71% of respondents thought government should prioritise reducing the public threat “even if this erodes people’s right to privacy”.\n“The idea that surveillance is for out own safety holds water, but only up to a point. Surveillance doesn’t inherently make us safer. And that’s aside from the misplaced assumption that surveillance always works, as many cases of misidentification suggest,” says Fussey, also an independent human rights observer of London’s Metropolitan Police while it trialled facial recognition technology from 2020.\n“The problem with people being suddenly more accepting of surveillance after, say, a terrorist attack is that the powers then given [to the machinery of state] don’t tend to be rolled back later,” he adds. “And then there is the fact that if we keep creating these tools that can be used for surveillance – even if that’s not their intended use – they will be. There is simply just so much evidence for their mis-use.”\nFurthermore, the expanding means of surveillance – from gait recognition to remote heartbeat analysis – are being developed at such a pace that campaigners and legislators can barely keep up. It says something concerning that a hugely powerful business the likes of Amazon has been entirely open in its ambition to create tech products with what it calls “ambient intelligence”, always there in the background harvesting your life.\nThere’s mission creep to contend with as well: if it wasn’t bad enough the state and commerce wanting to watch us, remote working has encouraged a culture of surveillance among employers too, with a boom in monitoring software being used to map the behaviour, mood, eye movement, location, online activity and productivity of often oblivious workers. The American attorney Zephyr Teachout has predicted the coming of “surveillance wages”, in which each worker’s pay is constantly changing according to that worker’s perceived alignment with their employer’s expectations. Data would be used for hiring and firing decisions.\nCould a new ad-free business model be devised for the web, disincentivizing data collection? Could the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation be adopted beyond its borders, even as Facebook obtusely moaned about how it and other regulations “may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, increase our costs, require significant management time and subject us to remedies that may harm our business”?\nIs there scope for a rebalancing of the interests of what’s often referred to as the surveillance industrial complex – which, of course, makes billions from monetising data flows, with China and US the leading exporters of surveillance tech around the world too – and the rights of the individual? Surely the transparency and accountability necessary for the relationship between state and citizen to function requires it? And yet, right down to how certain parts of your smartphones algorithms work, all is opaque, and getting more so.\n“We have to have a much clearer sense of how surveillance will be used, whether it’s legitimate and the necessary limits on its use,” implores Fussey. “We’re invited to think that the technology is just too complicated, but actually the standards we need to protect – standards in international law – are basic. The problem is who enforces those standards. We need the right policies, programmes and oversight.”\n“My concern is that so much surveillance now isn’t just about watching where you go and what you do but what information you consume and what thoughts you express,” adds Lemieux. “Surveillance can now be used to gauge opinion and so influence opinion too. It’s not just about watching us through data but manipulating us through data.”\nIndeed, the instruments of surveillance only look set to get more invasive, more clever, more wily and devious. The tide might be turning – Lindau argues that after a long period of being “promiscuous with sharing our information”, some of us are waking up, as low download rates for various government-driven tracking apps during Covid might suggest, for all that the pandemic opened the doors to data collection and tracking on a scale that would have been imaginable just a few years before. Some cities – Portland, Oregon, for example – have banned the use of facial recognition in its stores and restaurants. And there’s a growing academic interest in surveillance overreach too.\nAnd yet the more a surveillance mindset is applied, the more ordinary it seems. “Citizens are allowing greater and greater intrusion, to the point where the distinction between public and private has really broken down at this juncture,” suggests Steven Feldstein, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of ‘The Rise of Digital Repression’. “The smartphone has normalised surveillance, but it’s a slippery slope. You continue to push at the boundaries and surveillance just becomes more and more acceptable. And there are no concerns about this because there is no political will [to make changes]. And there’s no political will because nobody seems to care about it. We’re seeing a greater level of omni-surveillance made possible and that needs more push-back.”\nIn fact, we’re moving towards TIA, or Total Information Awareness, “the goal to know everything about everyone in real time,” as Lindau explains. “And so far all that has limited that most totalitarian of ambitions has been the tools.” Small wonder that the resistance to London’s ULEZ camera network is not simply a reflection of disgruntlement at yet more monetising of motoring but an unease at being watched for yet another reason.\nThe really bad news? The tools are coming: the AI Global Surveillance Index suggests that at least 75 out of 176 countries globally, many of them liberal democracies, are already using artificial intelligence for automated surveillance purposes. “All considerations we have about surveillance get put on steroids with AI,” Lindau says – the French government, for example, has just passed a law allowing the use of AI in mass video surveillance at next year’s summer Olympics in Paris; and for AI to work, the data must flow. Your data. Everybody’s data. “The ease with which AI will be able to amass and process information, combined with facial recognition, well, that’s ominous,” he says.\nHe cites by way of example his recent experience of returning home from holiday in Norway and passing through the notoriously aggressive and prying US Immigration. He was expecting the typical barrage of questions. Instead he was just asked to look into a small camera. That was it. Lindau asked whether they wanted to gather the usual details about where he had been and for how long and why. No, they said casually, we already know that.\nReally interesting – I’ve just been looking at your policies and was concerned about the proposal for national ID cards. It’s probably a bit out of date to worry about the introduction of ID cards but in principle it seems to be extending the monitoring potential of the state. Isn’t this an issue?",

Investment will be target the economic self-reliance of smaller operators, train and maintain a workforce and equip large vessels to fish offshore stocks more sustainably.\n- Quotas will be set using scientific evidence to avoid overexploitation and minimising discards in mixed fisheries. Social, economic and environmental criteria will be considered in quota allocation. Once the UK fleet has been revived quotas will only be granted to UK-owned and crewed vessels landing their catch in the UK.\n- Access to additional species quotas will be granted for small vessels along with financial support to enable them to adapt and exploit new fisheries.\n- Domestic consumption of sustainably-sourced British seafood will be increased via a public sector Buy British policy, clearer labelling and investment in local supply chain infrastructure.\n- The environmental impact of aquaculture will be reduced via new research and regulation, more sustainable feed sources, restrictions on antibiotic use, lower stocking densities, use of multi-trophic systems and co-location with wind farms.\n- The fishing industry and their wider communities will have a stronger voice in the establishment and monitoring of Marine Protected Areas. Commercial fishing will be given equal weight with other sea uses in marine spatial planning.\n- Coastal communities will be regenerated through a combination of affordable housing, selective restrictions on second homes and holiday lets, improved broadband and public transport, new industrial processing facilities, competitive business rates and tax regimes incentivising skills training.\nFisheries\nBritain is an island nation. We have a proud maritime history, rich fishing grounds and enjoy jurisdiction over the waters of 14 overseas territories – and yet we import most of the fish we eat. Fishing rights have fallen into the hands of a small and wealthy elite – including many foreign operators – while small-scale inshore vessels are squeezed out. Our fish stocks and the ecosystems which support them are an important national asset, but mismanagement over decades has allowed their depletion and degradation.\nWe must restore a fully UK-owned and crewed fishing fleet, protect the long-term viability of small-scale fishing and enable larger vessels to catch sustainable quotas.

We’re Britain’s fastest growing political party and we’ve seen a steady increase in votes in local and national elections in recent years. Now the SDP has shown it can win.”\n“Wayne Dixon’s success in Leeds – in a big city ward of 30,000 people – simply confirms what we are hearing on the doorstep – the public is crying out for a political party that’s straight with them. The SDP has strong policies on housing, the economy, transport, education, defence and immigration.”\n“I think a key factor is our success is that – like most of our fellow countrymen and women – the SDP is patriotic.

This will be sent to all households.\n- No head of local government will be paid a salary more than the Prime Minister.\n- Police and crime commissioners will be abolished. The oversight of policing will be the responsibility of police authorities comprising elected members from local government together with co-opted members from police unions, public interest groups, the NHS and the fire service.\n- Local councils will be forbidden to make financial investments or speculations not directly related to service provision.\n- A National Corruption Office will be established with full investigatory and prosecuting powers to deal with public allegations of fraud and corruption in local government.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_why-labour-will-fail-on-housing/content_533.html": "‘… children playing at shops…’\nLabour will publish a new National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which will set out strategic policy on plan making and identifying land supply for homes. This is nothing new. The existing NPPF obliges Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) to maintain a 5 year supply of deliverable housing sites and locations for a 6-10 and 11-15 time horizon (S.69a-b). If LPAs fail, developers take them on via the appeal system – and usually win, but it’s a grind. From conception and design to winning an appeal it can take 3-4 years before a foundation is dug.\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/669a25e9a3c2a28abb50d2b4/NPPF_December_2023.pdf\nRayner has said that ‘housing need’ – which is distinct to housing demand – must be calculated according the magnitude of local communities. Again, nothing new. It always has been… by definition. This is a basic part of a development planner’s training (I have worked professionally as a development planner).\nLabour will introduce higher housebuilding targets for local planning and make these mandatory for councils to deliver. It’s revealing that Labour imagines that a target – in itself – will make this happen. It’s a ‘children playing at shops’ approach which reveals a lack of commercial experience in Labour’s team. Every government for the past 15 years has ‘targeted’ 300k new homes and none has delivered (total national ‘all dwelling’ completions fluctuate from 170k – 200k – of which about 35k are built by Registered Social Landlords). Capacity is an issue… of which more below.\nLabour bemoans the fact that two-thirds of LPAs don’t have an up-to-date adopted development plan. I agree, this is a problem and is partly the result of general Tory hostility to planning. However, what Labour aren’t telling you is that correcting this will take longer than a 5 year parliamentary term. Preparing and adopt a local plan involves five stages – analysis, consultation, publication, examination, approval. It’s a complex process. Anyone who thinks LPAs can deliver new plans overnight understands neither the complexity of the process (defined by statute) nor the extent of commercial and public contestation prior to adoption. 100% local plan coverage won’t happen and even if it did it wouldn’t deliver Rayner’s 370k per year in time.\nLabour intends to re-designate poor quality urban fringe land from ‘green belt’ to ‘grey belt’ to make development possible. This approach slightly ignores the historical fact that green belt as a planning designation was never about the quality of land itself but, rather, intended as a tool to prevent conurban coalescence and sprawl. Nevertheless, it should increase housing completions… but it will take time.\nLabour wants to secure more planners – although 350 seems totally insufficient to me. However, an even more pressing ‘elephant in the room’ is the current inadequate capacity of the UK house building sector. We need more skilled construction workers. Rayner’s plans imply an overnight increase of some 85% in national house building capacity. It’s ludicrous to imagine that the government can click its fingers and magic this into reality. It can’t and it will take years to train and skill-up a new working population to do this… unless they intend to continue the Tories short term policy addiction of shipping in workers while Brits remain untrained.\nOne word unmentioned in Labour’s housing scheme is immigration. Naturally. There seems to be an official omerta in linking mass immigration policies to the necessity of finding somewhere for new migrants to live. And yet any numerate person knows that unless you’re expecting migrants to live in thin air, current levels of mass immigration put huge pressure on Britain’s housing stock. Current housing completion levels can’t even accommodate migration-driven housing need let alone provide for domestic-driven household formation. Ignoring this fact is a hallmark of the ruling political class. It’s deeply irresponsible.\nIn sum, Labour is embarking on a well-trodden path of posturing, wishing and regulating but not revealing – or really knowing – how its housing plans will actually be delivered. For that, it needs to answer three questions…\n- Who will build the houses?\n- What powers will they need?\n- How will we pay for it?\nTo these questions Labour has no reply. These are the three glaring gaps in Labour’s plans… which the @sdphq has already answered:\nhttps://sdp.org.uk/policies/housing/\nBoth parties dishonesty was on full display during the General election both Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak never dared to mention the I word Immigration this Government will achieve nothing in the next 5 Years Labour is unlikely to survive 5 Year’s in Office I give them 6 to 12 months before We endure another election the Social Democratic Party has a real Opportunity to become the next Government in future the rioting across Britain is a British Public enraged at this Political Class of arrogant entitled charlatans most of us despise the LabCon uniparty for the state of the Country We must get rid of them\nThis Horrendous Labour Government is already despised and deeply unpopular 3 months after winning it’s undeserved election victory the Conservatives rightfully got removed from Office after 15 disastrous Year’s I fear they will be in Office again in 5 to 12 months as Keir Starmer’s rabble will be removed by a vengeful British Public when the most vulnerable in Society will die in the winter months due to Starmer and Reeves callous attitude towards the elderly and the removal of the winter fuel allowance the Social Democratic Party could be that much needed alternative to another lousy Conservative and Labour administration not Farage’s establishment Safety valve Reform Party",

The method of delivery is not. The NHS requires substantial reform. It is over-managed and yet underperforms and the escalating costs of medical technology, an ageing population together with widespread lifestyle diseases will place huge future burdens on the service. The NHS must concentrate on its core function of treating the seriously ill and must properly plan its workforce requirements. Social care must be provided on a universal basis to end the geographical lottery in provision.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- The NHS will train British citizens to fully satisfy its workforce requirements and end the practice of large-scale importation of doctors, nurses and other clinicians from developing countries. Specialist clinical universities will be established to achieve this.\n- A National Care Service (NCS) shall be established which will organise, implement and fund social care throughout the country to provide good quality, comprehensive provision.\n- Special measures will be applied to GP surgeries whose waiting times are in the bottom decile.\n- NHS England will publish a plan annually describing resource requirements to reduce waiting times for elective surgery to 6 weeks, and waiting times at A&E times to under 3 hours.\n- A public volunteer service for aged care will be established. Those over 65 who volunteer for front line roles in the public aged care sector will receive credits toward the costs of their own aged care, at the rate of £10,000 for each year of full-time service. In effect, this will reduce the upper limit on costs a person can be asked to pay toward his or her social care under the October 2023 Act.\n- A national audit of the NHS will be undertaken and published, benchmarking its performance and costs against health care systems in other comparable nations, and issuing a headline report to all NI-eligible citizens.\n- NHS management and overhead functions will be reduced in cost by 15% in real terms over the lifetime of the parliament, with the savings returned to front line care.\n- Families who accommodate a parent over 80 years old in the same dwelling will be entitled to deduct 100% of the cost of state-funded aged care services from taxation.\n- Clinical negligence claims will be capped by law at £50,000 (the current average award).

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_migrant-crisis-solutions-ed-pond/content_226.html": "The irregular migrant crisis in the Channel is one of the biggest political issues of the day, with 100,000 having arrived since the boat crossings began in 2018. This has serious implications for our security, welfare state, resources and infrastructure. The Conservatives have lost control, admittedly thwarted in every measure by a reluctant establishment. Waiting in the wings, Labour has very few ideas – and arguably no desire – to deal with it. Meanwhile a vociferous fringe of the modern left demands an ‘open borders’ free-for-all. Some on the right suggest extreme measures without thinking practically or showing any empathy.\nWe need to tune out all the noise and identify fundamental things that need to be done. Below are seven measures that I believe are essential, doable and would get the problem under control. They will need political will, attention to detail, and most importantly, deep pockets.\nTo briefly discuss the international framework, this is formed by the UN Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which draws on it. There is in theory some leeway in individuals’ eligibility for asylum, which the UK can look to exploit. The framework also allows detaining asylum seekers while their claims are assessed, or sending them to safe third countries. All the measures I will suggest can conform to this, and if the ECHR keeps frustrating us from acting within its terms, we must reserve the right to leave. That would be regrettable and potentially risky, but may be essential.\n1. Offshore Processing\nIt would certainly be a deterrent if we immediately sent asylum seekers to a remote third country or British territory. To comply with the international framework, we would have to ensure the country was demonstrably ‘safe’. There have of course been efforts by our government to send asylum seekers to Rwanda (they would stay in Rwanda if accepted). A facility has been built, and £125 million has been sent, but as yet the government has failed to transfer anyone there. This is because the ECHR and later the UK Supreme Court (overruling the High Court) have deemed the country ‘unsafe’, despite it being a signatory of the ECHR. It certainly has a turbulent history and question-marks over the government of Paul Kagame, so perhaps was a poor choice (although Denmark did try to follow suit). The government will appeal the court’s decision, but it seems the plan is doomed and that money written off.\nThe failure has prompted the suggestion of using the British protectorate, Ascension Island. This would have an advantage over a foreign country where we wouldn’t have complete control. Alternatively we could lease land in third countries, use British staff to run the facilities, and arrange our own legal authority within them. It would be essential to make sure the facilities were safe and humane, not just for moral reasons but because any scandal would jeopardise the project. We have seen the outcry about the discovery of Legionnaire’s disease on the Bibby Stockholm barge – there is no room for error.\nBecause of the numbers of asylum seekers involved, offshoring alone would not be a solution. No third country or remote territory would have enough space, and the costs involved would be prohibitive. The point is, if in the migrant’s mind there was a chance that they would not reach the UK but would be taken to a far-flung place, they would be more likely to go somewhere else. Thus it would be worth the expense of offshoring a certain amount of people. Australia’s longstanding policy of offshore processing (admittedly combined with towing migrant boats back to the Philippines) demonstrates its efficacy. Of course, not being signed up to the ECHR works in their favour.\n2. Detention\nOur policy must mainly hinge on fully detaining claimants in secure facilities. The problem with the widespread use of hotels, and even the (currently evacuated) barge moored off Portland is that the residents are allowed out into the community. This is a security risk for our citizens and also gives an element of privilege. If you removed that privilege from the equation, again it would put people off from coming. We are obliged to offer shelter and basic needs to someone claiming asylum, but nothing more. And besides, if someone is really fleeing mortal danger and dreadful oppression, surely they would be grateful for anything?\nDetention would be expensive, but again, the deterrent effect would be worth it. Again, we would need to ensure the facilities were safe and humane, with independent inspectors and a minister whose only job would be overseeing the accommodation. There would be an issue of where to put such centres, but because they’d be secure the public and local authorities would be less likely to object. Also, they would provide employment and business for local people. We could hold referendums and offer incentives such as a reduction in council tax if communities voted yes.\nWhile we were building new custom-made centres, we would have to have temporary facilities. We could repurpose existing buildings, or even erect temporary structures like we did with the Nightingale hospital during the pandemic. Similarly we need to mass-hire Border Force and Home Office personnel, and buy more patrol vessels (we have only three active in the Channel). We need to up the efforts with our intelligence services to take on the smuggling gangs, increasing the budget to do so. Security does not come cheap.\n3. Returns Agreements\nWhen we left the EU, we did not negotiate any returns arrangements with other countries to replace the EU’s Dublin Agreement. This obliges the first country that registers an asylum seeker to process them. If the claimant goes to another EU country, they can be returned to the first. However, in practice member states avoid registering asylum seekers and the migrants avoid getting registered. When we were in the scheme, we had to accept many more into Britain than we were able to deport. In 2020 only 1% of our deportation requests were granted, 8% in 2019, 4% in 2018 and 5% in 2017. Despite its shortcomings the agreement may have been a psychological deterrent to the smuggler gangs.\nWe should seek a raft of bilateral returns agreements with other countries, making sure that they work well for us and renegotiating if they do not. An agreement of this type has been made with Albania, where many asylum seekers were coming from, and has had an effect. Other cooperation is required with France and others to tackle the problem. Our intelligence and border services need to work together to destroy the smuggling gangs. It is in our common interests to do this, because the problem has severe implications for all of us.\n4. More Efficient Processing\nLabour’s main policy seems to be increasing the speed of assessing claims. It is certainly true we should swiftly determine if claimants are deserving of asylum, and avoid them hanging around in hotel limbo. We are slow, with an average time of 15.5 months for a decision, compared to Germany’s 6.5 and France’s 8.5. Only 4% of 2021 claims were assessed by the end of 2022. However, the worry with the ‘faster’ approach is that claims would be rushed through without the required scrutiny, when if anything we need to have more scrutiny. Also even when we reject claims, the ECHR (or our own courts) often do not allow us to deport individuals, resulting in so-called ‘failed asylum seekers’ roaming our country indefinitely.\n5. Safe Routes\nAnother common proposed ‘solution’ is to simply allow people to claim asylum at British embassies and refugee camps and be freely flown over here, thus saving them the dangerous journey. This has been done with limited numbers of Syrian, Afghan and Ukrainian refugees. It could be rolled out, with proper scrutiny, to genuine warzones and trouble spots, but as a blanket policy it’s a nonstarter. It would simply encourage many more to come here as opposed to other nations, and we would be completely inundated. It would be a carte blanche to bogus claimants and their criminal traffickers.\n6. Removal of Pull Factors\nAsylum claimants get £45 of spending money a week. It’s not a lot in the UK but to them it is likely a significant sum. If they are fully provided for in the detention centres, this is not necessary. The notion of being put up in an (often high quality) hotel is probably also a draw, and we must do away with that. Word of mouth that the UK is a soft touch has undoubtedly spread. Anecdotally, I heard there is a false rumour going around we give £2000 a month to asylum seekers. Social media is a key factor in this and we should take action against accounts that encourage irregular entry. It’s worth pointing out that centre-left Denmark has several stern policies regarding asylum seekers, resulting in a drop to 1,500 claims in 2020, down from 21,000 in 2015 (it was 2,255 in pre-Covid 2019). We could use such measures.\n7. Temporary Refugee Permits\nGermany, rowing back on its irresponsible approach of 2015, has started limiting refugee residency permits to three years. If the situations in their countries are deemed safe, the permits will not be renewed and the individuals will be (apparently) repatriated. Asylum claims were down to around 244,000 in 2022, from nearly 746,000 in 2015. Even if this policy is not properly enforced, it is still a deterrent. Denmark has deemed Syria a safe country, and has also begun removing permits.\nWe have here outlined several methods by which we can tackle the crisis. The most important, I feel, is detention. That would be a game-changer, and the right thing to do to safeguard our citizens and the physical integrity of our country. Firm but fair action needs to be taken to protect the futures of our children and grandchildren.\nI heard somewhere that in an emergency situation it is imperative not to freeze. If you freeze you will not survive. Our political class has done just that, staying stunned and feckless as disaster unfolds. They simply have to get moving, and we have to make them.\nGreat ideas👍🏻\nWithdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights and the UN Convention on Refugees 1951 is crucial to a supposed major Country why do we need permission from foreigners\nDenmark deems Syria safe surprises me as I see gruesome images of ppl who have been tortured in Assads prisons on twitter regularily.

Voters in Peterborough can now be assured they will have a truly committed and experienced Brexiteer to vote for who will take on the establishment parties that are betraying the referendum result before our eyes in flagrant breach of their manifesto promises at the last general election.\n“I will also use the campaign to set out bold new ideas from the SDP to tackle other major issues in Peterborough such as overdevelopment, homelessness and growing levels of crime and anti-social behaviour that are undermining the quality of life in parts of the city. Let us hope a date for this much-needed by-election is announced very soon. The people of Peterborough deserve much better representation than they have at the moment, that’s for sure.”\nParty Chairwoman Sarah Devenney commented “Patrick O’Flynn has a proven track record as a robust, campaigning politician of integrity. A by-election would present voters in Peterborough with the crystal clear opportunity to switch up.”\nSDP Party Leader William Clouston stated: “We’re delighted at the prospect of a by-election in Peterborough and pleased the SDP has such a strong, locally well known candidate in Patrick O’Flynn. This is an ideal opportunity for the SDP – and for the people of Peterborough – to send a message to Westminster .”",

It may change in future so please check back from time to time.\nWHO WE ARE\nIn this Privacy Policy, the words ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ or ‘the party’ refer to The Social Democratic Party (SDP), a political party registered with the Electoral Commission, registration number PP243.\nIn accordance with UK data protection law, we are a Data Controller and accountable for the way we process personal data.\nWe are registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), registration number: ZA900533.\nCONTACTING US ABOUT DATA PROTECTION\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or would like more information about how we collect, store or use personal data, please contact us on:\nE-mail: info@sdp.org.uk\nPost: Social Democratic Party, 272 Bath Street, Glasgow, G2 4JR\nTelephone: 0141 354 1512\nHOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL DATA\nDirect provision\nPersonal data is provided directly to us by Members and Supporters of the party.\nMembers are those who have paid a fee and joined the party.\nSupporters are those who have provided their contact details to us in order to receive communications from the party.\nMembers and Supporters may provide their data in a number of ways, including:\n- filling in a form on our website (https://sdp.nationbuilder.com/)\n- contacting us by phone, post, e-mail or direct message on social media\n- communication with any party officer or member\nThe data provided may include:\n- Names and contact details\n- Addresses\n- Marketing preferences – e.g. opting-in to receive communications\n- Credit / debit card information – this is encrypted and not accessible to party officers\n- Political opinions – e.g. provided by members commenting on proposed policy motions.\nAdditional data generation\nTo the data provided directly by Members and Supporters, we may generate and add the following data:\n- Ward and constituency details based on the postal address provided\n- Record of attendance at party events\n- Value of donations to the party\nElectoral Register\nAs a political party we are provided with access to the electoral register by local authorities for the purposes of canvassing and promotion.\nHOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA\nWe use personal data for the sole purpose of conducting Party Business.\nParty Business is defined as legitimate activities that support the goals and objectives of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).\nExamples of Party Business that require the use of personal data include membership administration, event ticketing, fundraising, candidate selection and nomination, and communicating party news and other relevant information to Members and Supporters with their consent.\nOUR LAWFUL BASES FOR USING PERSONAL DATA\nUnder UK data protection law, we must have a “lawful basis” for collecting and using personal information. There is a list of possible lawful bases in the UK GDPR. You can find out more about lawful bases on the ICO’s website:\nWhich lawful basis we rely on may affect your data protection rights which are listed at the end of this Privacy Notice.\nOur lawful bases for the collection and use of personal data are:\nLegitimate Interest\n- Creation and maintenance of records for membership management purposes such as recording membership terms and payments, producing and sending welcome packs and renewal notices.\n- Communication with Members about essential party business, e.g. leadership elections.\n- Administration of internal party posts and election candidates.\nConsent\n- We provide information to Members and Supporters about:\n- party news such as meetings, events, campaigns, announcements, internal elections, internal party officer posts, requests for election candidates and volunteers, requests for donations and relevant content sharing.\n- third party campaigns, organisations, or content that we generally endorse (e.g. proportional representation), or events where prominent SDP members are due to speak.\n- Communication with Members about anything other than essential membership administration matters or events they have registered to attend is carried out on the basis of consent.\n- All communication with Supporters is carried out on the basis of consent. If a Supporter opts out of receiving digital communication, their data will simply be deleted and they will receive no further communication from the party.\n- The party communicates primarily by e-mail because it is cheap, fast and scalable. For reasons of cost, efficiency and reliability, postal communication is limited to essential items such as welcome packs, renewal letters, and leadership ballot papers.\nA Member may exercise their right under GDPR to opt out of digital communications.\nIf they do so, they may proactively access members-only party news by logging in to this webpage:\nhttps://sdp.nationbuilder.com/member_news\nHowever, it is hard for us to provide the full benefits of membership to those who opt out of digital communication as it is not feasible to provide Members with regular updates on party news via post.\nWe implore our members not to opt out of receiving e-mails from us.\nLegal Obligation\n- Recording and reporting information on donations to the party. See the section on DONORS AND DONATIONS for details.\nContract Fulfilment\n- Management of bookings and communications about party events, e.g. the annual conference.\n- Provision of services under the membership contract e.g. membership welcome pack and party newsletters.\nPublic Interest (promoting democracy)\n- Canvassing political opinions, for example seeking Members’ feedback on policy. Political opinions are classed as ‘special category’ data under data privacy legislation and our processing of this data is in accordance with Article 9 (g) of GDPR which states that “processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law…”\n- Administration of candidate selection and nomination processes, e.g. verification of signatures on candidate nomination forms.\n- Planning and running election campaigns, e.g. deciding where to field candidates, where to hold events, putting out requests for volunteers, and delivering campaign materials to registered voters.\nDATA SHARING\nWe will never sell your personal data.\nWe will not share your personal data with third parties without your permission, unless we:\n- are required to do so by law\n- need to do so in order to protect somebody’s vital interests\n- need to do so in order to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights\nDATA STORAGE\nThe party uses the data management system NationBuilder for all aspects of membership administration, including sending bulk e-mails to the membership, receiving and recording donations, and taking bookings for party events.\n- All membership and supporter records are created and stored centrally and securely on the NationBuilder platform.\n- NationBuilder allows delegated access to the regional branches and county level groups. This access is restricted to membership data in their geographic area.\n- Only authorised personnel in the party HQ or regional branches can send bulk e-mails to the membership.\n- The NationBuilder system joins electoral geography to membership data, adding each member’s Westminster constituency, devolved parliament and local government information to their membership record.\n- NationBuilder participates in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, and provides tools and functionality designed to ensure GDPR compliance.\nDATA PROTECTION\nWe take the security of the data we hold very seriously, and as such employ a number of security procedures to keep data safe.\nAccess to data\n- Access to personal data is restricted to designated party officers either at party HQ or in the branch network. This is managed on a strict need-to-know basis, meaning nobody has access to data they don’t need.\n- All those who access membership data are required to sign the Data Protection Form and attend data protection training.\n- Authorised users are instructed to use data extracts strictly in accordance with this Privacy Policy, not to pass them to other party members or third parties, not to use them for any other purpose than party business, and to delete them upon completion of the task for which they were requested.\nFinancial data\n- The SDP via its NationBuilder system does not hold detailed financial information on members.\n- Credit / debit card information such as cardholder’s name, card issuer, card numbers or expiry date, provided by Members via Nationbuilder is encrypted and cannot be read by party officers.\n- The only information visible to party officers is the fact that a member used a credit / debit card to pay for a membership subscription, donation or event ticket on a certain date and the amount paid.\nRegistration with the Information Commissioner’s Office\n- The Social Democratic Party is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).\n- This means we are legally required to report all suspected data breaches and all improper and/or unlawful uses of this data to the ICO for investigation.\n- The ICO has the power to both investigate and prosecute an individual responsible for any breaches of data protection which may result in substantial fines.\nDONORS AND DONATIONS\n- The SDP, like every UK political party, is obliged under UK electoral law to report all large donations and loans (currently at or above £11,180 p.a.) and the name of the donor to the Electoral Commission who will make this information public via regular reporting.\n- Donations below £500 p.a. are not covered by the rules and do not need to be recorded, aggregated or reported to the Electoral Commission.\n- Donations between £500 and £11,179 have some reporting requirements to the Electoral Commission but the name of donor is not disclosed.\n- The value of donations made by Members and Supporters is stored in NationBuilder and can be accessed by authorised party officers via a membership report.\n- The party advises anyone wishing to donate more than £500 and in the large donation category to read the Electoral Commission guidance:\nDATA RETENTION\n- Membership data is kept on a perpetual basis until a member resigns or dies.\n- When membership lapses, membership data will be retained for reasonable time-period before being deleted, usually after 2 years.\n- When Supporters opt out of receiving e-mails, their data is removed from the system.\nUSE OF PERSONAL DATA AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING\nWe are provided with access to the electoral register for the purposes of canvassing and promotion. We only use this information for:\n- Verifying signatures on candidate nomination forms\n- Planning and organising campaigns, which may include bulk postal communications or door-to-door leaflet delivery\n- Calculating campaign budgets.\nAs stated above, the only data processing that we currently engage in is adding electoral geography – i.e. wards and constituencies – to our membership and supporter records.\nWe do not currently use personal data or sophisticated data analytics to target voters using methods such as those described in the ICO’s 2018 report Democracy Disrupted?\nhttps://ico.org.uk/media/2259369/democracy-disrupted-110718.pdf\nShould we do this in future, we will update this Privacy Notice accordingly.\nWe may place targeted advertisements using the demographic data stored on social media platforms, but we have no direct access to this data.\nYOUR RIGHTS\nYour rights under UK data protection law include:\n- Right of access– You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. You can request other information such as details about where we get personal information from and who we share personal information with. There are some exemptions which means you may not receive all the information you ask for.\n- Right to rectification– You have the right to ask us to correct or delete personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.\n- Right to erasure– You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information in certain circumstances.\n- Right to restriction of processing– You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances.\n- Right to object to processing– You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.\n- Right to data portability– You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.\n- Your right to withdraw consent – When we use consent as our lawful basis for data use, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nTo make a data protection rights request, please contact us using the contact details on page 1 of this Privacy Policy.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-tragic-necessity-of-the-lockdown/content_524.html": "One day a judge will be appointed, witnesses will be called and an inquiry will begin into how and why the British government locked down society and large parts of our economy to tackle the covid-19 pandemic. To find out what really happened it must examine a concept at the heart of our leaders’ decisions – human proximity.\nIn his 2009 book ‘The Life You Can Save’ the Australian philosopher Peter Singer invited us to imagine walking to work. We pass a pond in which a toddler appears to be splashing about but on closer inspection we find the child is actually drowning. Saving the child will ruin your new shoes and dirty your suit. What should you do? All morally competent people will immediately save the child. What are shoes compared to a child’s life? However, Singer goes on to point out that thousands of children die every day, unseen in distant places for want of food and medicine and yet millions of us take no action to remedy this. Why?\nThe reason is proximity. What we can see directly effects our emotions and moves us to action, just as what we can’t see – aerial bombing comes to mind – insulates us from human pain. Proximity explains worldwide government action in applying lockdowns and it explains the ‘dust up’ between opposing epidemiologists Professor Neil Ferguson and the Swedish expert Professor Johan Giesecke.\nFerguson co-authored the Imperial College report which predicted more than half a million covid-19 deaths (without mitigation) in the United Kingdom and shifted policy towards lockdown. Revealingly, the motivation for the Imperial paper was narrow rather than broad. Its focus was on the present emergency (imminent deaths from a single cause) rather than those in the long term (future deaths from many causes). Ferguson’s view was quite specific: ‘We were looking at surges in healthcare demand and how do you avoid a health system being overwhelmed.’ He was convinced that lockdown measures would avoid deaths – proximate deaths – by driving transmission down.\nGiesecke took a different view. He believes that lockdowns are mistaken, will do more harm than and advocates a ‘herd immunity’ strategy which would run alongside protecting the vulnerable. Giesecke is quite resigned to our future, saying to UnHerd, ‘I don’t think you can stop it. It’s spreading…. It will roll over Europe no matter what you do.’ On this view, different policy measures won’t make much difference to the final death toll. It’s as long as it’s short.\nThe real difficulties arise when you consider the lockdown’s effect of flattening the economy because this is a policy with a long and vicious tail.\nThe synchronised decimation of the world economy will likely have huge cumulative consequences to human health including increased heart disease, stroke, cancer, depression, anxiety and suicide linked to joblessness and bankruptcies. Yet Imperial did not model this, which is a weakness because, merely from a utilitarian perspective, future deaths, although not yet visible, must count too. The lockdown itself is lethal but no one, it appears, was in the room speaking for this future ‘non proximate’ devastation. Looking forward, our task as Social Democrats is to work to limit the damage caused by these tragic events and, in particular, to do everything we can to prevent our young people from becoming covid’s lost generation.\nThis begs the question – could our government have acted differently?\nI think not. The lockdown was a tragic necessity and proximity explains why. Covid-19 deaths are visible, publicised, present and therefore highly politically salient. Attritional, long-term deaths from flattening the economy are exactly the opposite – presently unpublishable, immeasurable, unknown and unseen. The future victims of this are hidden and few speak for them. And our cynical ‘gotcha’ and ‘if it bleeds it leads’ press culture reinforces the problem. A world in which celebrity journalists compete to publicly shame politicians – and the press pack physically hound their advisors in the street – is not a world in which future (possibly greater) deaths could ever have been treated on a par with present tragedies.\nNo government would have challenged its – rather narrow – scientific advice and kept the economy open in March when world class hospitals in northern Italy were leaving the old to die. Tragically, human beings have a tendency to prefer smaller sooner payoffs over larger, later ones.\nIs that what the world, on the biggest scale imaginable, has just done? Probably.\nDamned If You Do And Damned If You Don’t\nI agree with was has been said. However, I hoped proximity was also going to focus on population growth, too many people, the “I can do anything and go anywhere culture”, mass immigration, etc, ie, all elements that help spread pandemics. This is what proximity is about as well.\nAlan Balcombe\nExcellent article! Thank you William.\nOver the last 10 years for every 10 British applicants with excellent qualifications that have applied to train as a doctor 9 have been rejected.The NHS has a shortage of doctors and a dependence on bringing doctors from abroad. Whilst those coming from abroad should be welcomed with open arms and valued and rewarded for the vital work that they do, it must be an imperative of the U.K. government to increase the numbers of young British Doctors and invest in British youth.\nI think they real issue is why the government relied on only one Scientific view? Additionally why was none of his computer modelling peer reviewed? In the future computer models will influence many government decisions surely these should been in the public domain to ensure transparency.\nThank you; as usual, decency and integrity. How we have backed ourselves into this self destructive corner is an embarrassing, shameful and occasionally hopeless question. Remembering that there is a silent majority is the answer. Thank you for your lack of silence.\nOn the one hand I agree with the questionable role celebrity reporters have played in this. That said, I’m of the mind that full lock down could have been avoided. We had the Asian model to follow from the start. We ignored their past experience of handling similar epidemics. Why did we ignore the WHO call to ‘test, test, test’? Even before they raised that call, we had the evidence for that course of action.\nIf the Imperial article (controversy over how robust a piece of evidence it is/was aside) had been used purely as a tool for NHS response planning, we could have avoided nation wide lock down. After successfully providing enough beds to care for critically ill patient’s we then left 1000’s of them to die in care homes. Reports suggest less than 50 beds of a potential 5000 were ever occupied at The Nightingale. Why?\nI agree that long term health issues resultant of the lock down were not considered in the response to the Imperial paper. It’s a complex issue though, as the number of COVID survivors rises alongside deaths, the ongoing health issues for those people becomes evident. I believed back in early March that test and isolate individuals was the way to go and I still hold that view. How were we ever meant to fight a communicable disease without information on how/where/who spread was happening? The government could have used February to prepare, but it was precious time wasted.\nGood point made about February, no one in the Madia seemed to get that, a month lost to the fight.\nThe biggest question that needs answering here is why, even after the realisation of the dangers posed by this disease, why were we still allowing people to enter the country from affected areas?\nPersonally, I hope we all learn a lesson from this. Most people can work from home using modern technology. My commute has been a dream for the past 3 months. (I am an emergency environmental pollution worker). The air quality has been superb.\nWe need a return to British manufacturing and stop this over reliance on imported Chinese low quality products. China has a ‘throwaway’ culture and that has to stop.\nIf we can stringent our economy quickly and efficiently then money will be generated to fund the essential services that very well might slow down the incidental mortality rate.\nSuccinctly put. I do feel, however, having gone this long in lockdown, that lockdown is being eased far too soon. Will the NHS be able to cope should we have a devastating second wave?\nWell they could have done it better…..we should have locked down earlier, tested more and traced more. We could have had the death rate of Germany but we have allowed thousands of senseless deaths. We could have actually protected the social care sector. It’s an elderly genocide\nA very reasoned and reasonable argument. There was, however, another way that would have stopped the economy from tanking.\nEnough was known for the government to :\n1. Close all borders and allow only UK residents in to be quarantined for 14 days;\n2. Isolate the aged and medically compromised;\n3. Institute social distancing, the wearing of face masks in public and recommening handwashing;\n4. Set up testing and tracking.\nThe government panicked when presented with Ferguson’s ridiculous model and MSM and social media hysteria.\nAn interesting article – unlike 99 percent of the media,\nat least you state the counter argument against lockdown.\nThe infection fatality rate – 3.4 percent- was way out.\nWhy haven’t the Cummings obsessed BBC noticed\nthat’s it’s nearer 0.26 percent- according to the US Center for Disease control. For this – we’ve wrecked the economy.\nPerhaps the journalists don’t care because unlike many of us\nthey get paid for Filing their reports from home. Rather than ‘safer than thou’\nLabour- SDP could be the the voice asking the questions that demand answers.\n1. Why did we lock up the healthy – whilst releasing covid infected patients back into care homes – throwing our most vulnerable elderly under a bus?\n2. When we are clapping the NHS – are we also clapping the Incompetent NHS management who outsourced to such an extent that they could not source simple PPE equipment like masks and gowns?\n3. Why are police following walkers around with drones and making up the law on the spot?\nThe fact that most people’ have been scared to death by the government and the media might mean that the lockdown was inevitable- but that doesn’t make it alright.\nIt did not help, as reported on the social media, that Macron threatened to close ‘the Channel ‘ to the UK if we did not implement a Full lockdown, shutting off food supplies. S\nI must say this expressions is intellectual and not of the common politic. I hope you maintain this proactive approach throughout your politics.\nConsidering all, the Government measures have been productive. Let’s see if they have the creative skill to steer the economy. Could this be a great British moment.\nThe clarity in the article is excellent! The tone is also spot on, in my opinion.\nI wish the main opposition party would demonstrate a non-politcised critique of the Government with such straight forward talk.. even if it disagreed with the tenet of this article.\nAs you say, I think the ‘gotcha’ style journalism is being copied from the US media and it is devisive and needless. We can all have different opinions, it is just if your arguments are not constructive, then they are destructive. I fear we are heading towards the latter.\nAs ever i agree with you William, even though i am a trapped in the middle Labour Party member with no voice. I would ask which path would you have followed if in power? And the data from Sweden suggests it had more deaths than its near neighbours but, as you say these are the imediate deaths. I am however sick of our media and your description is valid. Although Cummins did wrong in the eyes of the media I am sick to death of the coverage which won’t go away, the “gotcha” mentality cares little for the ordinary people dying and the many thousands who will lose their jobs once the Furlough system ends.\nThe huge elephant in the room is the corruption of statistical evidence. There is now no hope of ever learning anything of use in coping with any future epidemic when we no longer have the ability to establish how many of those who have died actually succumbed to the virus and how many of those were merely guess work by doctors who were instructed to include the words Covid-19 on the death certificate because symptoms seemed to fit the cause of death. Why would anyone consider that to be a right and proper thing to do if you know that research into the cause and effect was essential in trying to prevent this particular strain of the virus from spreading?\nI am doing my best to assist the mother of a disabled child with an EHCP, who according to the Government could still go to school despite the lockdown, except the school decided otherwise. It argued that as a special school it cannot accept all its pupils who all have EHCPs, and has denied him a place since the lockdown began. Even though he is in Year 1, the school continues to exclude him. His learning disability means he will not be able to cope if he does eventually get a place for two or three weeks before schools break up for the Summer, so she now has to keep him out of school for a full six months.\nHe is very demanding, does not understand anything about law or authority and has a foul temper if thwarted. He cannot understand why public buildings he is used to exploring are shut and flies into a violent rage when he discovers doors are locked. He takes the lockdown personally because he can’t understand anything bigger. He demands constant attention from the moment he wakes to the moment he goes to bed and has injured his mother when she has been too exhausted to get up to help him. Her injuries cannot heal because he will not leave her alone. All the services on which she depends for support have been closed or moved online where they are difficult to access or cannot provide practical help.\nMy proximity is not to my fellow citizens who might become seriously ill, but to two vulnerable people to whose wellbeing the lockdown is a direct threat, because it has been implemented without sufficient thought for the real needs of the vulnerable in our society.\nCorona viruses have been around for ever. We have evolved with them, and much of the lack of effect we have seen with the healthy is due to the innate immunity we have built up. Combined with vitamin D and not being obese there were experts who knew enough about corona viruses to stick with the first plan, and target the vulnerable.\nWe now have the bizarre fact of having to use masks, which restrict oxygen for those with breathing difficulties, breathing in their own exhalation, restricting the ability to read lips, an essential requirement for those with poor hearing. People are kept inside where they have no exposure to the essential bacteria that keeps their immune systems able to cope.\nA cool head was required by government, and they buckled from their own advice.\nWe have scared the life out of people, for a virus that is proven to be no worse than an influenza.\nThe one thing the SDP should have first and foremost in their mind when commenting about this is to follow the money, and ask who pays for and funds the scientists that are giving the advice. There are billions of pounds relying on their advice and the direction they want us to head.\nA good article – and refreshing to read something that suggests that ‘the government was not to blame.’ Years ago, police stopped using the word ‘accident’ and, instead, the word ‘incident’ became common. It was a reflection of a world where ‘accidents’ no longer happen – someone is to blame. We have become a ‘blame culture.’ Maybe my view is simple, but, in general, I truly believe that politicians do the best they can and go into the job to make the world a better place. The pitfalls are plentiful, the mistakes magnified and the successes seldom acknowledged. History and hindsight note the errors and governments seek to learn from them. Endless vilification of individuals in office achieves nothing but the press love it. The SDP seems to have a much broader and fairer view of events and people than any other party. To me, it is a great appeal!\nI don’t agree I’m afraid. The case for rescuing a drowning child is clear cut. The case for lockdown was made by an hysterical media over reaction spooking a government too fixated on populism – and based on a speculative algorithm no more scientific than my punts on the gee-gees. Lockdown has been more existentially damaging for our nation than most seem to realise, and I am disappointed that a party I’ve respected (and joined) as being ‘sensible’ doesn’t have profound reservations about the whole debacle. Over-reactions, restrictions on core liberties, the profound inequalities of recent policies and so much more set such a dangerous precedent; notwithstanding their immediate sociological and economic catastrophic impact.\nYour message is “sanity in a world of insanity”\nbrilliant the most sense yet written on the poandemic\nbrilliant my feelings entirely\nExcellent article. A focus on immediate, clearly apparent problems is indeed a negative feature of our society, and the cause also of our ill-preparedness for this pandemic. Hopefully this crisis will trigger some interest in longer-term thinking.\nHey William\nIm an SDP member in Woking.\nI agree with everything you say except that with a country as sophisticated as ours it should be relatively easy to slice and dice Covid infection by hospital/ care home / community and by region. Armed with this information there are areas of the country who are potentially being locked down needlessly if there are very few cases in their community. I could be sat here typing you this note before I head to the super market for my socially distanced shop where there might not be a case 20 miles from here? I wouldn’t know.\nThe time has surely come for a regional approach? We are all blinded by the 30,000+ deaths where the answer is in the detail.\nBest Regards keep doing a great job\nIan\nA well thought out article sir. I certainly hope that the Swedish governments approach to the pandemic is not a major catastrophe because that means a devastating loss of life. However their per capita rate is on the rise so a rethink should be on the agenda or the current Swedish government will not only be counting a very high human cost. But will also be having to wait a very long time before re-election. lock down is/was essential. Not only for the drowning child, but also the elderly neighbour who doesn’t deserve to be left for dead in a hospital corridor alone. As for the future unseen casualties of covid 19 then a transparent and specific taxation rise directly aimed to improve heath and social care to try and limit the aftermath effects of covid 19 surely will not be to much to ask of the uk tax payer? Think of it as a donation to a telethon appeal only spread over many years.\nMy own metric is the prevention of premature deaths not deaths as such. Of course this is tricky to define but I would concentrate on three-abortion, the climate crisis, and wars. Your whole analysis falls apart over the first-abortions, the taking of another human life, is proximate and known but now accepted wholesale in Europe and many other ‘civilised’ societies. At the same there is a focus on preventing the premature termination of lives in the decades ahead partly by stating’it is upon us, we must act now’, when it is not proximate in your sense. The premature termination of life in wars is, thank God, is a much reduced factor in the UK and ‘advanced’ societies such that each death in Iraq was announced in parliament. Meanwhile 4000 babies are aborted in Britain each week on grounds that go well beyond those (often validly) given in the 1967 Act. All part of what Jenkins termed a ‘civilised’ society. Extraordinary. We just seem to ‘park’it as a private matter.\nOf course lockdown leads to a great many negatives which need to be balanced against the positives of lockdown in curtailing the virus. However, there are also positives to lockdown, which never seem to be mentioned in this calculus: for example, lower pollution is undoubtedly saving lives and reducing misery; reduced traffic deaths; increased leisure time; lower commute-related stress. Mr Giesecke’s judgement is looking increasingly poor, in my view. In Stockholm, serelogical tests show that only 7% have contracted the disease; countries are showing that with disciplined application of lockdowns, social distancing, mass testing and contract tracing, the disease can be defeated: Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand are all excellent examples, but there are more.\nHaving had a couple of weeks to reflect further on this, I think I do have to disagree about the basic thesis! (Is that allowed?) It is not the rôle of Government to give in to crowd hysteria, but to take wise decisions for the good of all, including explaining the hazard of triggering social and economic damage to people’s real lives. there’s no point avoiding half a million deaths from a virus if it leads to a million deaths from poor nutrition, substance abuse, psychosomatic effects of loneliness, fear or poverty, domestic violence, suicide, health and safety failures caused by economic desperation and corner-cutting, or many other causes attributable to a lockdown or economic consequences thereof. What happens if we can’t get the harvest in because of the economic disruption? People will starve, that’s what.\nIt’s the rôle of Government to notice these things and explain them, not to give in to public or media pressure.\nWhen the lockdown was announced, its stated purpose was not to prevent the disease happening, but to shift the peak into the late spring and summer where it could be handled better. That mission seems to have crept and now we have to keep the lockdown indefinitely while we wait for a vaccine to appear. That could last years. We were supposed to get it over with in summer so it would be behind us before we head into next winter. Now it is with us for the indefinite future because we didn’t take the opportunity to put it behind us.\nI don’t pretend to know which approach would have been better, but I can’t help wondering whether the lives saved will be worth the lives ruined.\nI disagree, the Gov was bounced into lockdown by Sage (Ferguson), France, China’s precedent and too much groupthink. Giesecke is very reasonable and our advisors agreed with him initially, until the utterly unreliable Ferguson was listened to. Why his argument carried the day, given his previous unfulfilled doom-mongering, we can only surmise.\nUn herd’s evidence from Profs Levitt, Gupta & Sikora was compelling but does not seem to have reached Gov level.\nIt now seems that the “peak” likely flattened by itself, not as a result of school closures and lockdown. Could we have done better, yes if we had closed borders immediately and run a track and trace system like Korea but as yet the death rate is not that high: no-one got hysterical about the estimated 50,100 excess deaths in the winter months of 2017/18 (Office for National Statistics).\nProf Karol Sikora advises that there will be very many additional deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease going untreated as a result of lockdown. Once the virus was here in force a shielding scheme for vulnerable groups may have been a better way to proceed.\nJohnson, Hancock and Ferguson must be fully held accountable but I doubt Labour will do anything even with it’s more saner new Leader Labour is an embarrassment to be honest they are basically a gang of sixth Formers in a adult’s world the SDP could replace Labour the Tories must not be allowed to trample on Our freedoms either\nThe problem with ‘herd immunity’ strategy is that there is little evidence that catching C19 makes immune. Indeed, the growing evidence is that any immunity you may develop could be short lived. So allowing millions to catch it, and potentially tens of thousands to die – many more than the 55,000 that have already, could have failed to achieve anything.\nThe fact is C19 is barely understood by the scientific community. At one point it was thought to be transmitted person to person – now it looks increasingly like it is an airborne infection. Scientists don’t know why it kills some and leaves others, more vulnerable, alive. Or why some sections of society appear more vulnerable to its affects than others.\nI don’t agree with everything the UK Government, or the devolved Welsh Government, have done in relation to the pandemic but given we are effectively stumbling around in the dark, we did what we had to and the best we could. We can always say about any decision that things might have worked out better, or differently, if we’d approached it in a different way but the truth is we can’t know for sure, and you can’t live life second guessing yourself all the time. You have to make decisions and hope for the best.\nThink on this – if we’d gone for ‘herd immunity’ and half a million had died, and the NHS had collapsed – and then we found there was no immunity, would that have been a better choice than the ones taken, even if in the long term it’s affects may be worse?\nCOVID is on the decline We have one of the worst Governments and opposition in My life time the SDP can offer a much welcome alternative to further Tory or Labour Governments both fill Me with dread Johnson needs to be removed asap\nThis article is well written but ignores that the danger of the disease was massively over stated and lockdown only inevitable due to the state sponsored panic whipped up by the vast majority of the media. The question is not proximity but proportion, saving the child is clearly a proportionate response but locking down the whole country is not.\nThere is a clear global agenda with this that is there for anyone to read ‘The Great Reset’ ‘Agenda 21’ ID2020’ with money easily followable to vested interests and I am disappointed to see the lockdown being taken at face value by someone with whom I agree on almost all important issues and usually sees through the media narrative.\nI disagree fundamentally. Perhaps one can forgive the initial lockdown because of incomplete knowledge of the virus itself, events in Italy and the fear and panic created by the government’s own PR and by the ratings-chasing media. Notwithstanding that, I cannot believe that Johnson and Cummings etc were not fully aware that while the number of cases was increasing daily, the percentage rise (and this is crucial) was getting smaller day by day. This meant there was no exponential rise but that the bell-shaped curve of all viruses was being drawn. The epidemic would flatten and then fall down the other side to give the typical bell shape. Sure enough, this was confirmed as early as April 8, proving that the epidemic had peaked before lockdown. That should have been the end of lockdown and the start of the type of common sense policies which were being followed by the Swedes.\nBoris Johnson panicked mainly because of the very fears among the electorate that he had helped to bring about. So on and on went his government with the scaremongering, the U-turns, the illogicalities etc etc – and all with minimal Parliamentary scrutiny. These actions were follies but I believe that sending untested elderly people to die and cross-contaminate others in care and nursing homes was nothing less than the crime of involuntary manslaughter. We are now paying the price of this cowardice medically, educational and socially.\nI think of the SDP with warmth when I look back at its stance against the authoritarian, undemocratic aspects of the European Union. Is it not time for you to come out publicly to call for an end to this Conservative government’s authoritarianism and bullying in favour of trusting to the good sense of the British people?",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_smartie-pants/content_131.html": "If your child has a smartphone, you might well panic at the now prevalent idea that their adolescent, still developing brain is being “rewired” – that the undoubtedly revolutionary device to which pre-teens and teens (and not a few adults) seem to be habitually glued could be a catalyst for mental illness, anxiety or social isolation.\nIndeed, Jonathan Haidt – the high-profile psychologist at New York University’s Stern School of Business – is adamant about what we, as a society, should be doing: put simply, children should not have access to a smartphone until they turn 14, and no access to social media until they are 16; schools, meanwhile, should simply ban the devices. We have to act now to save a generation, he claims. No wonder, making claims like that, that smartphones have become such a hot topic, if not an altogether conclusive one.\nIn part this antipathy towards smartphones – not, stress, computers or the internet or all screens – is because smartphones are by far the dominant means of accessing social media and, as a new report by the American Psychological Association has stressed, social media platforms are “inherently unsafe for children. [Children don’t have] the experience, judgement and self-control” to manage themselves on them. And, it hinted, social media’s opaque developers are doing all they can benefit from this fact – manipulating through algorithms – while blocking all attempts to moderate usage.\nIt’s not simply parents’ fault, says Haidt. But he does argue that parents have, over recent decades, fallen for all sorts of bogey-men: unfounded perceived threats to their kids in the real world, from ‘stranger danger’ to the desire to pad playground equipment, and that this, perversely, has latterly led them to gravitate towards the reassurance that their children are safely at home behind a screen. For decades we’ve over-protected our kids in the real world, and now under-protected them in the digital one, Haidt reckons in his book ‘The Anxious Generation’ (Penguin).\n‘Safetyism’ – a term Haidt coined – has, among other factors, quashed traditional play, as older generations might understand it – being out there, socialising face to face, learning independence, taking the knocks necessary to grow into a balanced adult – with devastating consequences. He cites one shocking statistic to prove this point: before 2010 – that year marking the wide uptake of the smartphone, together with developments the likes of push notifications, front-facing cameras and social media platforms – teenage boys were much more likely than any other group to be admitted to hospital with a broken bone. After the early 2010s those boys are now slightly less likely to break a bone than their fathers or grandfathers.\nFurthermore, Haidt argues that the 2010s – the start of the smartphone era – also saw a leap in rates of anxiety and self-harm among boys and especially girls. “Mental health [in many developed nations] falls off a cliff. It’s incredibly sudden,” he has said. Studies he cites show not just the “attention fragmentation” that smartphones bring, but the sleep deprivation and the social deprivation – a rise in isolated and lonely teens. Even when in each other’s company teens are often on their phones (a habit seen in adults too, giving rise to the term ‘phubbing’, or ‘phone snubbing’). As the sociologist Sherry Turkle has put it, “because of our phones, we are forever elsewhere”.\nThere are also longer-term implications for society, Haidt proposes: children are largely sex-segregated online – boys favouring YouTube and gaming, girls the more social, more performative and arguably more problematic “brand management” platforms the likes of Instagram or TikTok. That segregation isn’t conducive to dating, to the development of relationships. And if smartphones and social media are encouraging a generation that’s fragile, that’s scared to take risks – those encountered not just out in the real world but, one study suggests, those found even just in talking to someone live on a phone – that perhaps bodes ill for, among other things, the future entrepreneurial economy.\nThese are all the harmful externalities – as economists call the negative costs imposed by a private business’s actions on people – produced by social media; ones that, were they an oil company polluting the seas, would quickly drive government action to stop it, Haidt suggests.\nIt all adds up to a pretty demoralising picture, especially for parents of course, and especially for parents whose children have already opened Pandora’s Box (the one with the Apple or Samsung logo on it). Around the world a fledgling movement against the smartphone seems to slowly be gaining traction: in the UK, for example, there is in the pipeline a tightening of regulations to keep kids away from their smartphones in school; in Florida a bill has been signed making it illegal for people under 14 to have social media accounts in the state; grassroots organisations the likes of Smartphone Free Childhood are springing up. And so on.\nBut hang on: is Haidt actually right? For all that a lot of this undoubtedly speaks both to common sense – why, for example, would any school allow smartphones in class? – and to many parents’ impression of their children’s use of smartphones and social media – more time spent alone, less physical inactivity, greater mood swings and irritability, apparently shorter attention spans, the persistent distractions and so on – seeing it all through a stricter scientific lens might paint a different picture.\nCertainly Haidt – who concedes he is merely postulating about where this might all go – is not without his detractors. They broadly argue not to dismiss the idea that smartphones are having these negative effects on adolescents – that could be true, while also acknowledging the seemingly contradictory benefits of smartphones bring, such as the ability to make connections – but that the evidence presented by Haidt is not yet substantial enough to reach his conclusions.\nWhile the numbers are nonetheless concerning – the percentage of 17-18-year-olds who say they hung out with friends “almost every day” saw a dramatic decline from 2009, for instance – the reasons for them can’t be placed at the smartphone door with certainty. Indeed, psychologist Peter Gray, author of ‘Free to Learn’ and one of the world’s leading scholars of play, likes to flip things on their head: extend some of the graph data Haidt uses back to the 1950s, he says, and from that point you see a continuous increase in adolescent anxiety until around 1980, when it was similar to today’s figures. But then starts to decline, before rising again in the 2010s. Why that decline?\n“I have a theory that it was because adolescents had the first home computers,” he says. “It gave them a new culture of childhood, and remember children were the experts on computers in a way that gave them pride and prestige”.\nWhile the increase in anxiety among adolescents has increased since the 2000s, maybe that’s down to the many rolling global crises – growing economic instability, existential angst about the climate, the threat of nuclear war – that arguably paint a picture unlike that experienced by previous generations. Or maybe the increased rates of mental illness are the product of the growing awareness of mental illness, or changes in diagnostic definitions that broaden what mental illness is. Or maybe the seeming decline in teenagers meeting up in the real world is down to the lack of places to go to, or – for twentysomethings too – the lack of money with which to do it.\nThere may well be a link between smartphones and declining mental health. It’s just not clear that smartphones are the cause: it’s estimated that around half of Gen Zers with anxiety disorders would have had them irrespective of smartphones, for instance. Gray posits the cause as being radical changes in school curricula in many countries over the last 15 years, with increased pupil testing and the ranking of schools leading to a reduction in the time given to recess and fun, ‘non-essential’ activities. It’s why studies, he says, have repeatedly seen teenagers cite school pressure as the number one cause of their anxiety, followed by job prospects.\nBottom line: some experts say the evidence against smartphones is overwhelming, others that it’s not so strong, though their evidence delivers no knock-out blow to Haidt either. The experts don’t agree because the experts don’t know.\n“Everyone needs to take a breather with this issue,” implores Pete Etchells, professor of psychology at Bath Spa University, UK, and author of ‘Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time’ (Piatkus). “The effects of smartphones do seem to be real, but [the reasons] are hugely complex, and the smartphone perhaps sits in an eco-system of many factors that affect mental health.\n“Do we have bad habits with smartphones? Absolutely,” he adds. “But my concern is that there’s no clear consensus in the scientific research on the impact of screen time and yet a clear consensus seems to be suggested by the public conversation at the moment. The parents I’ve spoken to have a real sense of despair about how this debate has gone”.\nEtchells concedes that this sounds like he’s suggesting everyone just waits several years for better studies to reveal what we need to know, time we maybe don’t have. But, he stresses, this is not to suggest that we can’t do anything positive now. We can pressure the tech companies to do better – governments might necessitate that social media companies actually enforce age verification for their users, for example – though he worries about this back-firing, with these companies disengaging from the discussion because they can never be seen to be doing enough.\nHaidt adds that parents might choose to give their children a more basic phone – without social media capabilities – and phone makers might do a better job of making these devices more appealing. He also concedes that this isn’t something any isolated parent can tackle: because to be the only kid without a smartphone is to face ostracism, they need to coordinate their smartphone clampdown with other parents in their social group too. Parents can look to their own behaviour as well, says Etchells.\n“I struggle with all this as a parent to of course,” he says. “I struggle with moderating my own tech behaviour in front on my kids, for example, or in the way I talk to them about it. When I’m asked why I’m on my phone in front of them I sometimes kind of quickly hide it away rather than explain why I’m on it [which may be a very valid reason].\n“It would be ridiculous to say to parents ‘don’t worry’, especially when it’s hard to look at kids on their phones and not believe they’ve been completely sucked in. But it’s not the phone. It’s not how long they’re on their phones, since time in itself isn’t an indication of anything bad. It’s what they’re doing on their phones that’s the issue. That’s why we don’t want teens to feel that they have to hide their tech use, or that they can’t talk to their parents about their use. And it’s never too late to start working on this”.\nTo start with parents can learn to let go, Gray argues. “Ironically it’s often parents who want their children to have a smartphone because they want to be in minute to minute contact with them, even to constantly track their whereabouts,” he says. “It’s this umbilical cord that’s the smartphone’s most damaging aspect – the kids are never left to be independent of interfering adults, which they need to be to develop. Ask some teenagers why they spend so much time on their phones and they say it’s because it’s the only way their can communicate with their friends – they’re not allowed out, or if they are their friend isn’t”.\nAnd so the confusion mounts. That we come to some better understanding of what is going on, and of how we use smartphones, is important, Etchells suggests, in no small part because he doesn’t see Haidt’s proposals for moderating usage as being enforceable anyway. He cites an attempt in South Korea to impose an internet curfew on teenagers from midnight to 6am; screen time just increased during the allowed hours.\n“What we really need is joined-up national digital literacy initiatives [that teach children how to safely run their digital lives],” he argues. “We don’t ban children from driving until they’re 17 and then just give them a car – they have to undergo training in how to drive first”. Another analogy, he says, is to consider the safe enjoyment of the sea; yes, children can drown, so you could simply restrict them from ever entering the water. But that would be to keep from them the many pleasures that being in the sea also affords.\nSomehow, we have to find the same balance with smartphones. Some have argued that this debate amounts to just another anti-tech moral panic of the kind that saw concerns about the impact of TV, or of the Walkman, or video games, and that the evidence for the smartphones’ harms is scant. Yet right now it nonetheless feels instinctively correct to default to the assumption that for any developing brain to stare at a screen for five hours a day – one that invites negative comparisons, rewards exaggeration and extremes, and is designed to be addictive – probably isn’t a good thing.",

Tim and Willam discuss political divides in America, the storming of the US Capitol, and the choices available to the Biden administration. Afterwards, they reflect on Britain’s “Red Wall” and the extent to which Labour and the Conservatives are culturally misaligned with it. Finally, Tim and William discuss how well social conservatism can sit with purism on free trade.\nClick here to find all episodes of SDP Talks in podcast form.\nClick here to visit the SDP’s YouTube channel.\nHi William,\nI’ve only just rediscovered the SDP, but you are the Party I have been searching for for the last 5 years. Can you tell me where you will candidates in the up coming elections? Or is thst something you cannot disclose at the moment?\nI come in the Epsom & Ewell consituantancy, in Surrey.\nKeep up the good work!\nThanks\nI joined the party last April and will happily renew my membership when I get a reminder in a few weeks this Country is in a desperate need of a n alternative to the failed LibLabConSNP We need a written constitution and hopefully become a Federal republic were everyone is equal and not in nonsense like Royalty and entitlement\nVery informative. Am seriously considering joining the SDP and have enjoyed various articles and youtube videos to inform my decision.\nWas wondering if there might be a clip or video interview produced regarding the Union, constitution and addressing nationalism both in scotland/ wales but also in Northern Ireland with the advent of the Irish sea trade border and NI protocol.? Overseas territories might also be included. Certainly a hot topic currently. Kind regards.\nA good discussion, I was curious at the start how you were both shocked by Capitol Hill but didn’t mention BLM and antifa who have burned cities to the ground destroying whole communities.\nOne the red wall, all the main parties are refusing to grasp the nettle that is immigration. It’s why Brexit won the 2016 refendum and why so many , up and down the country still feel they have no stake in democracy. Whenever the topic comes up it gets shut down immediately. I’m glad William seems aware of the concerns of many families. The Tories have been consistently promising action on this but continue to be inactive. Look at the porous borders we have now, with an 80 seat majority!\nIf the SDP concentrate on the disillusioned and abandoned blue voters I think you will get some traction. We certainly need a viable alternative to the Red/Blue flip flopping of Lib, Lab and Con.\nYou sound like you have the basis for some promising policies, I look forward to hearing more from you",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_sdp-talks-with-patrick-harris/content_10.html": "In this episode of SDP Talks, SDP leader William Clouston speaks with Patrick Harris, the chairman of the American Solidarity Party.\nPatrick and William discuss the American political scene, the problems of big tech and crony capitalism, the folly of recent foreign military interventions, and the hope that communitarian politics brings for the future.\nExcellent discussion. We look forward to joining you in future discussions from The Sensible Centre in Australia. We are on the same page.\nA comment on the term ‘centrism’. The reality is that, historically, there have been two kinds of centrism – the elite, neo-liberal version and the communitarian, distributist version. We have had both in Australia, historically, and they have competed, waxing and waning. Our strand of centrism has several Christian Democratic iterations – the first in 1920 with the formation of the Democratic Party by the Catholic Federation of Australia. This was a false start, but it happened again successfully in 1955 with a Catholic breakaway from the Australian Labour Party called the Democratic Labour Party (which was represented in the Senate from 1955 to 1977).\nIn the 1970s and 1980s it was replaced by the elite, neo-liberal version in a party called the Australian Democrats (represented in the Senate from 1977-2004). But this version is now in dramatic decline. It has morphed into the cultural left and Green Party, and has become indistinguishable now from the general Left. We are now claiming the centrist space for the communitarian, distributist version.\nHowever, a confessionally Catholic political party is a mistake, and in particular a policy stance of abortion prohibition is not wise. The abortion prohibition stance continues to marginalise Catholic social activists and Catholic social thought in Australia in a very pronounced way. We say that abortion should not be prohibited (any more than alcohol) but that, in a messy and imperfect world, it is a necessary evil. This is the one issue on which we part company with the Christian Democratic tradition.\nWe retain use of the term ‘centre’ because our electoral system makes it the pragmatic place in which to be positioned. We do not have a first-past-the-post electoral system, we have a ‘preferential system’(sometimes called the ‘Australian’ system in some countries). This is a pretty good system – voters number the candidate options in the order of their preference – if there are six candidates on offer, voters number them from 1 to 6 in order of their preference. If the candidate of your first preference is not elected, your vote is transferred across to your second preference, and so on, until one candidate gets 50% +1 of the vote and is elected. In our Senate, based on proportional representation, this means being in the centre is the place to be, rather than on the fringe Left or fringe Right. What this means is that the natural positioning for reformist and populist sentiment is in the ‘centre’, against both Left and Right, in the mainstream as against the extremes.\nThere’s so much more to say and talk about. I hope we can.\nAbortion is not a ‘necessary’ evil whatsoever. It is just evil. A malignant destructive force against the common good both morally and ethically.

Course costs above this level will be met by central government. We will also lower the interest rate on student loans to CPI and cap total repayments at 1.2 times the original value of the loan in real terms.\n- Tuition fees for taught courses and research in critical infrastructure and key sectors directly supportive of our industrial strategy will be set to zero. In some cases, this benefit will oblige a period of work within the public sector post-graduation.\n- We will balance national skills needs by significantly reducing the number of new bachelor degrees and increasing funding for vocational qualifications. We will also expand access to “degree apprenticeship” programmes, ie hybrid degrees which balance academic study with practical workplace experience.\n- Universities are for all. They will be expected to actively promote and encourage a wide variety of viewpoints, giving space for civil discussion without fear of harassment or no-platforming. Universities which fail to adhere to this requirement will face a withdrawal of government support for new student loans. The SDP’s policy “Charter for Academic Freedom” sets out the minimum expectations in this regard.\n- Postgraduate places will be only offered to international students in fields with high academic standing or industrial relevance.\n- Universities will be required to establish a body to validate the English language skills of all prospective international students before they are accepted for courses in the UK.\n- We will boost Government funding for university-based research, preferentially in areas of strategic industrial value, but also across a small number of areas of excellence in the arts and humanities.\n- Universities with unoccupied real estate will work with Innovate UK to offer business space to UK-based start-ups at cost / peppercorn rental rates for a period of 2 years.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2024_08_05_riots-and-violent-disorder/content_262.html": "The violent disorder in towns and cities across the country is without precedent. Anyone participating in rioting, looting, arson and attacks on the police and members of the public must be speedily identified, arrested and convicted. Rioting is a direct threat not just to property but to to life and limb, and there is no justification for it.\nSociety does not commit crime – individuals do. However, everyone knows that social conditions also play a role in maintaining order. Our political elites have – over half a century – managed to turn a high-trust, safe and culturally cohesive society into an unsafe, bitterly divided one. These riots are a product of the Britain our political class has created, as successive governments failed to improve the living conditions and opportunities of millions of British people – particularly the low paid. They have been too enthusiastic about mass immigration, naive about its inherent conflicts, and indifferent to our unity as a people. Too many unassimilated British citizens and guests lead separate lives in separate communities, and those in power do not care.\nFor the government to regain the respect and confidence of the British people, three urgent tasks must be undertaken:\nFirst, we must gain control of the streets and restore order without delay – and without fear or favour. People in the affected towns and cities must be able to return to their normal lives in safety and with confidence. Those who have committed acts of violence and looting must be punished.\nSecondly, we must ‘stop the boats’ and gain full control over the UK border. To spend billions of pounds accommodating illegal migrants in hotels while cutting winter fuel payments for our own elderly population and overseeing widespread homelessness among our own citizens is monstrous. It shows why so many no longer believe that those who govern them have their best interests at heart. It is leading to a dangerous collapse in respect for government and for the law itself. Elite complicity in an open border is at the root of this.\nThirdly, our governing class must end its reckless policy of mass immigration and replace it with domestic capital investment and expanded training opportunities for its own people. Unprecedented immigration has been a reckless gamble, an experiment which has conclusively failed. It is economically harmful, culturally reckless and socially destructive. This weekend shows that it has damaged the only home we have on this earth. It must stop now.\nSDP Leader William Clouston states:\n“The horrific events of the past few days have appalled so many of us. First the savage murder of three girls and the terrible injury to many others in Southport and then a series of violent reactions all over the land.\nThose who govern us must get a firm grip on public safety without delay – but they must also be honest and admit that disastrous mistakes have been made over many years. Our ruling elite must heed its errors and correct them before it can be trusted to lead the country onto a wiser, safer and more peaceful path.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_why-labour-has-no-economic-vision/content_68.html": "On Thursday, Keir Starmer gave what was supposed to be his most significant speech as Labour leader to date. Labour insiders eagerly claimed that this speech would mark a decisive moment for Starmer and the party, and would establish Labour’s economic policy for the coming decade. Labour’s press office went so far as to compare the speech to the 1942 Beveridge Report, which laid the intellectual foundations for the post-war welfare state.\nThen, he finally made the speech, and we learned what Starmer’s supposedly bold vision was:\n“Standing up against inequality, believing in the role of government, and that if you have government and business working together you can do more than what the Tories propose, which is just business and no government.”\nThe anticipation leading up to the speech evaporated, and was quickly replaced by frustration. Commentators and the public realised they were not being treat to a bold vision, but a series of platitudes.\nThe fact was that neither Labour nor the Conservatives had substantively disagreed on any of the above principles for decades. If they were there, Johnson or Sunak would have tripped over themselves to agree with everything that Starmer had put on the table.\nThings only got worse as time went on. Starmer put forward what was – supposedly – an equally bold policy platform. He supported extending the furlough scheme, ending a pay freeze on key worker salaries, extending the business rate relief and VAT cuts, and stopping cuts to universal credit. Then, to cap off this not-so-revolutionary policy set, Starmer proposed a “British Recovery Bond” that would sink costs incurred by the pandemic for decades. Sadly, this final point wasn’t as novel as he’d hoped – such a bond had been SDP policy since July 2020.\nApparently, this speech had been six months in the making. It was supposed to be Labour’s new call-to-arms. Yet, within hours, commentators from across the political spectrum were trashing the speech as vague and uninspired. It was even accused of verging on outright plagiarism of Conservative policy.\nMany people feel confused and angry as to the performance of the Labour party. The Conservatives have been in power for eleven years: they first presided over a decade of austerity, and then over a response to the pandemic that has been roundly criticised from both the left and right. Boris Johnson’s disapproval rating has remained stuck above 50% since June 2020, and virtually the whole nation agrees that something has to change about business as usual.\nYet, the Labour party seems to fail at the fundamental job of being an opposition party: it’s unable to diagnose the failures with the ruling party, and it can’t seem to provide an alternative to the electorate. It has no vision.\nWhy? It’s tempting to suggest the Labour’s lack of vision is due to incompetent or unimaginative leadership. But there’s an alternative explanation, and one which is more powerful: Labour is structurally incapable of developing any vision.\nLast year’s Labour Together report grimly pointed out that with the loss of Scotland, Labour’s survival would depend on a voting coalition between two groups:\n- A “graduate class” of liberal-leaning voters in large cities\n- A “traditional” working class of historic Labour voters in Britain’s former industrial heartlands\nLabour must bring these two groups together to succeed. However, at the same time, it’s now near-impossible to reconcile their interests.\nSo far under Starmer, this has already been seen in the form of major internal conflicts erupting over what should be innocuous gestures like the use of the national flag in party media. While amusing, fissures like this are not superficial. They extend far beyond social and cultural matters, and into the domain of economics.\nBroadly, outside of Momentum radicals, Labour’s graduate class is content with the Blairite arrangement of economic “centrism” mixed with a performative streak of social justice. By contrast Labour’s traditional working class base is broadly amenable to a robust social democratic state which seeks to safeguard their livelihoods, and better control the flow of labour and goods.\nUltimately these two positions cannot be reconciled in the long-run, which means that Labour’s voting coalition is doomed. Any clear economic vision would likely cause major revolts and split within the Labour party, with such a split damning the party to failure – whether it be through the Conservatives capturing the traditional working class, or through the Liberal Democrats taking the graduate class.\nIn a perverse way, then, Starmer’s speech succeeded. Because of the disparate coalition that makes up the party, Labour’s leadership must meander along with unambitious and vague platitudes. This is because only unambitious and vague platitudes can delay the destruction of the party.\nUnwittingly, Labour has morphed into a large version of the Liberal Democrats – yet another party harbouring mutually incompatible beliefs which is unable to win a General Election.\nI would highly recommend Paul Embery’s book “Despised. Why the Morden left loathes the working class” to SDP members for an erudite examination of the rupture between the “Graduate class” and “Traditional” that Mathew highlights in his blog. Time to entice Mr Embery away from labour I think , William?\nOnce again with inequality labour always assume it is due to outside forces which can be changed by government ,some inequality is down to personal choices or cultures. Indeed a lot of working class supporters in their heartlands believe this and until Labour start believing in personal/ with freedom comes responsibility ,they wont win them back. And as for business ,if they cared that much about business they would not have campaigned for earlier,harsher lockdowns and would they surely would see that a prolonged furlough scheme will bring economic disaster. Companies have already undergone change (via online sales etc or diversified) in lockdown and some jobs wont be available when the lockdown ends.\nJohnson does not fear Starmer’s Labor party Johnson fears a angry public if things do not improve rapidly now We will soon emerge post covid19 the SDP has a golden opportunity to become a credible Government in waiting Labour is unlikely to enter Government for at least 15 Year’s or more, the working class has not forgotten Labours past treachery during the Blair and Brown era’s Mass immigration and the unnecessary Iraq war\nAn excellent analysis of where Labour is failing the traditional working class. After the Referendum, there was a huge opportunity for a party that would represent ordinary, patriotic and decent working people. I mistakenly, thought that this was UKIP. There is still a real opening for the right kind of party to hoover up these votes. They have currently lent their support to the Tories. As people see their life chances and aspirations failing to be met by Johnson and the conservatives they will look for a new political home.\nThe establishment arm of the UK will never allow any political party that counters the prevailing orthodoxy to gain traction in this country. Look what they did to Corbyn. No I would not have voted for him either, clearly not able to control his own party, much less the country. What we have now are two political mainstream parties that are two sides of the same coin. I am an advocate of “Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom” I would also apply that to international politics.\nWe have 3 failed old political parties that no longer should be allowed near government ever again a smarmy London centric lawyer leading the Labor party or a political opportunistic buffoon who has trouble with honesty leading the conservative party the Liberal democrats are still an irrelevance who will never get near office again like they did in 2010 when part of the coalition government the sdp has a real golden opportunity to offer a real alternative to the LibLabConSNP in government\nEven with the woes Liz Truss is facing Starmer should not be too smug as the current Government could turn things around the SDP needs to be an alternative to the conservative and Labour parties\nWell.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_how-to-pay-for-covid-19/content_179.html": "This is a time of painful discovery about what really matters in our economy. I think we in the SDP need to argue hard that those lessons are not forgotten when the government’s bills start coming due. I’m tasked with reviewing SDP economic policy, and I want to press the case hard now that we need to meet those bills in a way which will allow constructive (rather than constrictive) post-virus economic and financial policies. A social democratic future must not be hostage to Covid’s bills.\nWe don’t know the cost of Covid-19 to Britain in terms of human life, lost production, jettisoned employment, bankrupties and financial erosion. But all of them imply an assault on Britain’s fiscal cashflows and national balance sheets probably unseen outside wartime. How we pay for it will frame the economic and financial environment for at least a generation. It is probably the single most important economic, financial and political decision we will live to see.\nDisasters happen more in some places than others. They happen a lot in Japan, where I spent three years studying the economy. Over time, its governments have tried various ways of dealing with the hangover from disaster. They have some lessons to teach us.\nFirstly we should recognize that our balance sheets getting trashed has nothing to do with economic and financial conditions and policies before the virus hit. We should not assume that the ongoing destruction will have anything ‘creative’ about it, as many are saying.\nAnd just because of the random nature of the attack, it makes no moral or political sense, and certainly no economic or financial sense, to let Covid’s bills dictate or crab fiscal policies in the short and medium term. Coming out of economic lockdown only to embark on lasting fiscal austerity would be a ‘second wave’ of destruction all of our own making. We must resist it, and argue for imaginative fiscal flexibility.\nI would suggest taking a leaf of Japan’s book, and establishing a distinct Covid-debt sinking fund, to be paid down over, say, 60 years.\nIn Japan, when disaster hits and ‘unexpected’ public debt balloons, the new debt is added what is called the Government Debt Consolidation Fund (GDCF). Public rules about how that debt is going to be repaid are then set in motion. The key stipulation is that the debts in the GDCF are to be repaid over a 60 year period. So, for example, if the debts in the GDCF amount to Y600 billion, then after 10yrs, Y100 billion will have been paid down out of government revenues (i.e. taxes or asset sales), whilst the remaining Y500 billion will be refinanced. Each year, then, nibbles away at the total, and within 60 years the GDCF will, notionally, be out of business.\nIn Britain’s case, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) should be tasked to identify just how much this year’s Covid outbreak has cost the Exchequer, in terms of lost revenues and unexpected spending, unexpected debt. The OBR’s total should then be held by the UK Covid 2020 Sinking Fund.\nBy laying out an unambiguous but long-term plan to pay down that debt, the government acknowledges that fiscal responsibility has not been abandoned. It also acknowledges how the economic and financial shadow to be cast by the virus will be both broad and long – and escaping it will be, and should be, a multi-generational task. Most importantly, it divorces that question from the immediately urgent task of economic reconstruction once we’re out of lockdown.\nThe disastrous impact of Covid makes SDP’s economic policy of shoring up domestic economic, industrial and financial resilience more important than ever. We must be prepared to fight against the spurious type of ‘fiscal responsibility’ that would cripple our recovery and deepen the already wide fractures in our society post-Covid.\nProcurement is good, very good place to start. Serco handed £45million contract, up to £90 for DWP “Contact Centre“. Under Mr D Liddington former Cabinet Office Secretary protocols: employment for disabled, local supply(SME`S), training, agreed at time but were they agreed to on this occasion, virus or not? Skills in said Office depleted by revolving door into private sector with staff taking loopholes with them and on occasions coming back as high paid consultants! Government national and local now ashamed of in-house bidding due to history of seventies strife and strike. In house should be first place to start for `basic` services leaving technical: IT, construction to private sector. Example of loss of in-house is military trained chefs, mechanics, logistics at high cost then outsourcing it at higher inflated cost. Compass Catering have dominance within MOD and own supplier so higher price follows and this resulted in `Pay as you dine` for personnel also having ludicrous consequences: NHS staff working within MOD site do not pay, military recently swabbing mouths and nostrils pay but out on training exercise they do not! Contractor is `go to` because loopholes suit them.\nProgressive taxation primarily. Increase min wage to reduce tax credits, tax global corps at point of sale and not allow them to choose which country to pay tax in, if for all purposes someone is an employee, then they are taxed as one under PAYE and not allowed to pretend they are LTD, increase top rate to 50%, avoid other people’s wars, increase council tax for 2nd props, extra tax on buy to let props, bring utilities back into public ownership, introduce ceiling on public sector pay.. That’s for starters, I’m sure I’ll come up with more ideas as the day goes on…\nI agree that we need a specific Covid recovery fund. This should be funded by public investment. Investors would be guaranteed a return of 2% over base rate for a 5/10./25 year term. These could be called Covid recovery bonds\nThis needs to be operated in conjunction with tax cuts for businesses and individuals.\nWe should also take advantage of leaving the EU to scrap the bureaucracy that holds back business. There needs to be targeted public investment into creating balanced economy which is less dependent upon services\nThese policies will enable economic recovery and growth.

William and Emma explore how this has happened, and why it has been permitted under both Conservative and Labour governments.\nOf course, these ideologies have been around for a long time, but it seems that their advocates have exploited the weaknesses and preoccupations with COVID in the past year or so to accelerate them, and to to inculcate them into our institutions.\nHope you don’t mind a few disparate thoughts.\nThis is one of the best things I have listened to in ages. I remember sitting through graduate papers at Oxford, where the scholar tried to apply Fouaoult to a straight forward historical and philosophical situation. Dreadful. But interestingly, some of the dons in the seminar who felt it was a ‘waste of a good paper’, failed to challenge and it was left up to other students. It wasn’t pretty.\nThe point at the end on Burke was masterful and true. I had to read Burke at university and am so glad I did. Too\nOne analytical philosopher who I knew in the States, Alvin Plantinga, never had a problem of critiquing these sorts of ideas nor in presenting viable intellectual alternatives. I regret he is much older now.\nI have never been a member of a political party until now. But having read your (our) constitution and policies, as a practicing Catholic who is very concerning about the family and and direction of travel in our communities and country’s politics, I had to join and don’t feel marginalised. I could never now be part of either labour, Tory or the liberal democrats (which seem to be neither). Thank you,\nThis was a fascinating discussion. It needs to be heard more widely.\nHow do individuals combat these progressive ideas without compromising their position in the works place, on social media and in society? I am fortunate that as a retired person, I can express myself without fear of losing a job.\nCould you kindly compile a list of the books that you and Emma quoted in your discussion.\nThis is one of the best discussions of the current cultural crisis that I have come across. Will email to some of my friends. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.\nI watched the film, listened to the discussion and was heartened by the views expressed in both, like others I agree it deserves a wider audience.\nThe academic establishment was discussed in detail but nothing of the populist establishment, TV. and the press. Just look at the current trend concerning the gender, race and ethnicity of presenters, pundits and competitors featured on TV programmes, just watch the adverts between programmes. It is far more than just an academic “deconstruction” of institutions there appears to be a positive movement to force a minority culture on the majority.\nThere was a very small part in the discussion that made the very true comment how do you make your point if you disagree the much of BLM movement without being classed as a racist?\nThe football supporters who booed the players as they took the knee are not racists, I would suggest they are reacting to promotion of anti racism messages (much of which is totally irrelevant), the “deconstruction” mentioned in the discussion and the fact that both have been promoted daily ad nausea for almost 2 years. (Is it any coincidence that it appears that poor White boys are the greatest academic under achievers?)\nIt is clear what William feels on the subject, and in deed the SDP’s view as outlined in the “New Declaration”, I completely agree with both. However, I do feel on this like other issues without a simple message there is a danger of becoming just a source of Hi brow discussion and debate rather than a party pf appeal and change.\nI think that Rene Girard’s interpretation of Christianity is very relevant here, especially to what Emma was saying about people looking in the wrong direction with regards totalitarianism. When people are so confident that they are ‘on the right side of history’, they are inevitably blinded to the violence in their own position(s), or at least believe that their violence is justified in purging society of perceived danger. The quasi-religious group-think unites people in ostracizing, and sometimes even murdering these ‘dangerous’ members of society. Precisely why Jesus’ prayer ‘forgive them, they know not what they do,’ makes complete sense. The mob that murdered him thought that they were serving justice, but in fact were caught in a psychological trap. Girard’s ideas complement Arendt’s ideas nicely in this way. This doesn’t help to answer the question though – how do we get more people to see the trap? Perhaps through greater attention to the humanities curriculum in schools, so people have greater understanding of the history and diversity of philosophical ideas? Of course that requires de-politicization of the curriculum, and of teachers, which is not the current direction of travel!\nReally enjoying these SDP podcasts having just stumbled upon them!\nIf the SDP does not take a strong stand against wokeism, it will show that SDP is not interested in liberal democracy, which is under threat.\nBut if the SDP takes a strong stand, they will gain a lot of disaffected members from the other three parties, and in time replace the LDs.",

For every £1 we spend on food, we spend another £1 in hidden costs. Successive governments have sacrificed long-term prosperity – our natural capital – for short-term gain.\nBritain has become a country of food banks and yet over 25% of food is wasted in the home and 9% before leaving the farm gate. Britain’s farmers – squeezed by the supermarkets and food cartels – struggle to make a living and most make more from subsidies than from farming itself. The abuse of antibiotics, pesticides and nitrate fertilisers has made farming neither economically secure nor ecologically viable.\nFarms, Fields & Food makes the case that the primary causes of our difficulties – ignored for a generation by our political class – relate to the structure of our farming and food systems and the incentives they apply. The solutions lie in facing up to the true cost of good food, the value of ecological restoration and the necessity of trade policies aimed at greater national food security.\nThe Green Paper advocates a comprehensive re-balance to achieve four targets:\n* Affordable healthy food and fair prices to producers.\n* Sustainable farming and environmental restoration.\n* Thriving rural communities and a small farm future.\n* UK food security in a global market.\nSDP Leader William Clouston comments:\n“Farming and food has – rightly – become a massive political issue and so the SDP’s new Green Paper is timely. Our farmers are struggling, our fields and rivers are degraded and many fellow citizens find it hard to source good quality nutritious food. The Government’s answer is to ignore these problems and rely even more heavily on food imports – a massive economic and strategic mistake.”\n“We must stop deceiving ourselves. The crisis in our farming and food system is both an economic and a cultural problem – partly the marker of a throwaway society. We must face up to the true cost of healthy food and the need for trade policies that protect British producers and consumers.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2020_09_11_social-democrats-oppose-new-covid-19-restrictions/content_668.html": "11th September, 2020 – The SDP today announces its opposition to the government’s new COVID-19 restrictions. We call on the government to instead adopt a sustainable public response to the pandemic, befitting the long-term challenges it poses.\nThe newly-unveiled restrictions demonstrate a failure by policymakers to adequately consider the long-term social and economic health of Britain. Alongside the harm inflicted upon the nation’s struggling hospitality industry, the new restrictions on social gatherings are set to indefinitely deprive many people of the collective experiences which are essential to their sense of belonging, purpose, and humanity.\nBesides the long-lasting damage inflicted by the restrictions, these measures also threaten to permanently undermine the liberties and freedoms of the British people. The introduction of ‘COVID-19 Secure Marshals’, ostensibly to help local authorities support social distancing, represents a heavy-handed intrusion by the state into the lives of individual citizens.\n“A considerate approach is needed in response to COVID-19,” says William Clouston, SDP Leader. “The government should encourage and enable the vulnerable to voluntarily shield themselves, while calling on the rest of the population to behave in a respectful, responsible and tolerant manner. The virus is here and may remain for some time, which means a ‘stop-go’ approach to opening and closing society is unsustainable and inappropriate.\n“Furthermore, some restrictions on personal freedom are unacceptable in a free society. The threat of curfews, limits to social gatherings and the compelled wearing of face masks represent an unprecedented encroachment into the dignity and autonomy of Britons, which we fundamentally oppose. The government’s response to COVID-19 must be communitarian, not draconian.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_big-speech-big-ideas/content_274.html": "“It can’t go on like this”. We chose that strap line for this conference partly because it’s from the film ‘Withnail and I’ but mainly because it’s true. It can’t go on like this. I want to talk about three things today: where we are, how we got here, and how to solve the situation we find ourselves in.\nFirst, where we are. Brace yourselves – the government hasn’t balanced its budget in over 20 years. This year we will borrow over £200,000 million. The national debt now stands at £2,388,000 million – the highest ever. We’re addicted to a drug called debt. We haven’t had a positive balance of trade in goods since 1985. No-one will talk about it – not least those who caused it. We save too little, invest too little and produce too little. We consume too much – particularly from imports. And look at those imports – often from factories using slave labour.\nHousehold debt is rampant and use of food banks common and yet a quarter of food is wasted in the home and 9% before it even leaves the farm. Our rivers are polluted with sewage, our fields degraded with nitrates, our seas are over fished and yet we can’t even begin to feed ourselves.\nMeanwhile back in the city there’s an epidemic of knife crime, but no honesty about the main cause, which is family breakdown. We have a young generation renting not owning, denied a house to start a family, their wages syphoned off each month in high rents. This is met with silence from the so-called conservatives that govern us. These people can’t even control a national border. We have aircraft carriers costing billions but thousands of illegal crossings in the Channel. I had no idea Albania was so unsafe…\nI’m unaware of any nation in history that’s survived very long without a border – but this is an experiment the Tories seem determined to try. As Sergeant Wilson might say, “Is that terribly wise?”\nWe have a massive unsustainable Ponzi scheme – otherwise known as the University Industrial Complex – which creates millions of pounds in student debt that’ll never be repaid. Vice Chancellors get rich but under their noses freedom of speech and freedom of thought and inquiry is dying in the academy.\nAnd back in the real world there’s a shortage of doctors, engineers, plumbers and builders because we can’t be bothered to train them. Why? Because it’s easier to rely on immigration. And after inventing civil nuclear power in the 50s our government, pathetically, begs the French and Chinese to build power stations – in the same way as they ask foreign states to run our railways. Shameful. Do they honestly believe the French would return the favour? Certainment pas.\nIn sum, we’ve lived off debt for 40 years and that’s about to stop because the era of cheap money is over. And the added problem for Europe is that the era of cheap energy appears to be over too. I think the unserious people who got us here should be run out of office. Question is… who will replace them?\nI’m going put a flag in the ground. I think the root of our problems are cultural: bad ideas, bad ideology, short-termism, unseriousness. Basically, the hallmarks of runaway liberalism. An obsession with rights over responsibilities. A preference for the global over the familiar and of other people’s culture over your own. The loss of a life in common and of social solidarity. The elevation of personal feelings over empirical facts. The racialisation of everything – putting differences over what unites us. The deification of the free market. An indifference to what is made where and by whom. And a stubborn refusal to plan. In fact, the demonisation of planning. The result? Debt, inequality and division. Liz Truss is basically the death spasm of this type of thinking. But as Epicurus might console us, it’ll be painful but it will pass.\nYou’ll find no better example of bad ideology than in housing. It was Tawney who said: “The solutions to our problems are rejected not because they’re difficult but because they’re simple”. That’s very, very, good. The cause of the housing crisis is simple. It’s the deliberate destruction of state-sector capacity in housebuilding combined with large-scale immigration. That’s it. And the solution is to correct both. But ideology prevents the great minds who govern us from grasping this. Consequently, each year we spend £17 billion on housing benefit – dealing with the symptoms – but only £9 billion on building houses. Madness.\nIdeology of this kind has destroyed something else – the Brexit coalition. It’s over. The libertarian right only had one idea for the post-Brexit world: unilateral free trade. Nothing is more likely to destroy this country.\nA good example of this type of thinking is Liz Truss’ Japan trade deal of last year. Any good? If it was so, it might be. If it were so, it would be. But as it isn’t, it ain’t. It’s not a good deal. Let me run through it…\nLast year Japan exported goods worth £7,422m to the UK. We exported £5,954m of goods to Japan. We have a bilateral trade deficit of £1.4 billion. Truss’ trade deal is predicted to increase Japan’s long-run exports to us by 80%, but ours to them by only 17%. Question? Can Liz do maths? I know the Chancellor struggles… That trade deficit is going to get much bigger. As Peter Shore once said: “You can’t go on borrowing that”. A surer way you will not find of getting poorer…\nIt’s very odd. Libertarians see trade deficits as a badge of honour. As if borrowing billions each year is a strength, like a crack addict boasting he’s got another fix. My point is that if Liz Truss thinks Japan is a good deal what does a bad one look like? This is child-like, empty, cargo-cult Thatcherism. And it’s got to go.\nLet me turn to another cultural pathology – anti-Britishness. The loss of the Queen last month made us ponder the span of her reign. One reflection is that – despite her efforts – we’ve become a more divided country. Isn’t it curious that so many of our cultural leaders denigrate this country?\nAn example. Tom Daley, the Olympian, made a BBC film about homophobia in the commonwealth. It’s a problem. Pakistan and Nigeria are not at the vanguard of gay rights. The cause of all this hatred, he asks? A British law from 1923. In a tight field that’s one of the silliest things the BBC has ever put out. Possibly even sillier than The Ministry of Silly Walks… Someone’s to blame – and it must be the British. I’ve no doubt that Daley is sincere but he’s an expert at jumping off a plank into water. An expert on why Nigeria hasn’t had its own version of the Wolfenden Report he is not.\nI want to turn now to the question of short-termism – the tendency to constantly take easy, immediate options in preference to long-term rewards. This is very, very costly. A good example is UK energy policy.\nWe face an energy crisis which our rulers failed to anticipate or prepare for. The proximate cause is Russia’s reprehensible, self-defeating invasion of Ukraine, but we need to dig a little deeper. We used to build nuclear power stations in this country. But we stopped. Why? Because we no longer wanted to. The Tories closed down British Nuclear Fuels in 2010. And just a few years later they were chatting up the Chinese Communist Party and the French to build them for us. What would Clem Attlee think of that? I think if you don’t care who produces our power or who runs our railways you’re not fit to govern us. You know, the real tragedy is that we now don’t have the base load power we need. Truss’s energy bailout will cost £200 billion. We could’ve built enough nuclear power to provide most of our electricity for that. And we’d have reduced carbon emissions too.\nI don’t despise the Tories. I despair of them.\nWe’re living through industrial decline caused by cultural decline. You can’t have an industrial economy without affordable energy and Labour and the Tories wanted neither – so stuck they are in the grooves of decline. But my real point is this – the decline doesn’t consist in not building nuclear power stations. It consists in not wanting to. That’s the problem.\nLabour and the Tories have stripped away common purpose – and we need to get it back. And isn’t it interesting that Starmer’s Labour Party is actively against the public ownership of our utilities? What is Labour for? Eddie Dempsey is right, by the way. Labour’s been taken over by liberals. Starmer is like a woodcutter without an axe to grind – even for woodcutting.\nThe next thing I want to cover is un-seriousness, which you see everywhere. The NHS is always under strain but few consider the demands we put on it. True, it probably does too much. Thank goodness the Tavistock Clinic closed and isn’t maiming young people. But in reality the NHS is a sickness service because we’re increasingly ill. How can it keep pace? One in three Britons is overweight and suffering from diabetes or pre-diabetes, a condition which consumes 10% of the NHS budget. In some areas a third of children starting primary school are obese. Supermarket shelves are as stacked with junk food as our streets are with scooters delivering pizza. The government response? Well, it was thinking about banning 2-for-1deals on Mars bars… pathetic.\n“If you see anything that’s not quite right. See it, say it, sort it.” Have you heard that? I’ve seen something not quite right… on the South Coast. Thousands of young men arriving in boats uninvited, unvetted and unchecked. You’d have to be blind – or a Liberal Democrat – not to see this for what it is: an invasion. An invasion that’s now costing £5 billion a year and over £40,000 for each illegal migrant. You could send them to Oxford University for less…\nQuote: “You cannot live with people upping sticks and just simply moving across national boundaries because they think they’ve got better prospects of a richer and a healthier life there.” That’s David Owen. Quite right.\nIn truth, the government doesn’t want a secure border. The Rwanda Plan is a publicity stunt and if it weren’t they wouldn’t have left the legal means in place to undermine it. This is very, very dangerous. Without a border the social contract falls. Sharing will collapse and you end up with the type of clannishness you see in failed states. Historians will reflect that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent it.\nIs it time for some solutions? How do we solve these problems?\nHumbly, I have eight suggestions.\nFirst, start by supporting the family – the foundation of society. And be honest that for children and society, on all the data, the best model is the traditional family. SDP Policy: couples raising children together should benefit from full sharing of tax allowances. That’ll give parents more precious time with their children. “You can’t have the family farm, if you don’t have the family,” as Chesterton noted. Apparently it’s now terribly controversial to quote Chesterton. It’s too late now… I’ve been doing it for years. And on the family, you can’t be pro-family then object when workers ask for wages fit to raise a family. There’s a reason the RMT’s on strike today – they haven’t had a pay rise in three years.\nSecond, face up to the housing crisis. Solve it and you start to deal with the cost of living crisis. Expensive housing is not socially useful. It’s harmful. The solution: stop mass immigration and get the state back into the business of building homes. It is that simple – if your isn’t mind is addled with ideology. I asked the SDP Policy Team for the three ingredients to solve the housing crisis. I got them: new entities to build the homes, powers to assemble the sites, and money to build by taxing planning gain – that uplift in land value after planning permission has been granted. To be sure, SDP housing policy is radical. It will upset some people. There will be fewer yachts and Lamborghinis…. but it’s a price we’re prepared to pay.\nThird, re-build our manufacturing base – the foundation of our towns and cities. In the 60s and 70s you could raise a family of four on a weekly industrial wage of 40 hours. Four on 40. Not any more. And no – you don’t get growth by magic just by cutting tax and wishing it. I wish I could play for QPR… No. You need a plan, an industrial policy. Back British manufacturing in every Department of State. Buy British products, re-shore industry and plan a programme of targeted import substitution. We must make, buy and sell more in the UK and we can if we want to.\nAnd adopt a sensible trade policy with tariffs to protect key industries too. On tariffs… if you even mention them people accuse you of wanting to run a Bennite siege economy or that you’ll start a trade war. You’re in a trade war now – every second, every minute, every hour of every day.\nFourth, return the utilities – the natural monopolies – to public ownership. Scottish Water is publicly owned and its purpose is simple – to supply the public with water. When I turn on the tap in Scotland it’s not obvious to me that things would be better if a merchant bank loaded it with debt or if dividends were syphoned off to foreign owners. Not at all.\nFifth, reform the voting system. Nothing causes short-termism more than First Past The Post. Labour and the Tories can hardly think past this week’s headlines let alone a parliamentary term. They can’t solve the problem because they are the problem. They’re a symptom not a cause.\nSixth, get a grip of the national border. Adopt SDP policy on overseas detention. Do that and the illegal crossings stop. Then concentrate on more deserving cases such as women and children in refugee camps. And always remember, we’re not asking for much. We have the right to a secure border. As John Howard once said in Australia: “We will decide who enters this country and the circumstances in which they come.”\nSeventh, get serious on animal rights and the environment. No one else will. Get control of our territorial waters and introduce a maritime environmental policy which leaves parts as ‘sea wilderness’. This will allow fish stocks to recover to seed neighbouring zones. And build a British trawler fleet so we have some control of what happens.\nFinally, get sensible on labour market planning – starting with the NHS. If you only train half the doctors and nurses you need you run into trouble. And get serious about the causes of ill health – the demand side. Here’s a cost-free measure. Start a fitness regime in schools. One hour compulsory exercise per day. Ban sweets and packed lunches and offer good, free school meals for all. And get children to drink something called… water. People will say you can’t do that. Oh yes you can – and you’d be very foolish not to.\nIn sum, the answer to bad ideology is good sense. The solution to un-seriousness is to get serious. The cure to short-termism is long-termism. Have a plan.\nA few years ago a young man stood for election in Leeds. He got a few hundred votes. Labour beat him. They got thousands. Now most people would have given up but Wayne Dixon isn’t most people. And the SDP isn’t like most parties. We fought and fought until that Labour majority was reduced from thousands to hundreds. And this year the dam broke. We took the seat from Labour in a landslide, getting more votes than all the other parties put together. A landslide which ‘The Yorkshire Post’ described as “one of the most shocking election results Leeds has ever seen”.\nExcept it wasn’t shocking. It’s what happens if you have clear principles, work hard, never give up and offer the public something decent to vote for. It was an overnight success… five years in the making. And let me tell you there weren’t too many dry eyes that day.\nSome may think it a small victory but 32,000 people in Leeds now have a first rate SDP Councillor. When I walk down Middleton Park Avenue I’m in SDP territory – and that’s a good feeling. And now Wayne is joined by Cllr Richard Bright in Derbyshire.\nWhat happened in Leeds can happen nationally but it’s vital to understand what we’re doing. The SDP in the 80s started at the top and worked its way down. We’re doing exactly the opposite and it takes time. Labour took 24 years to get into government. Under Jo Grimond the post-war liberals took 20 years to re-emerge. The Greens and UKIP took the same. I think we can do it more quickly but there are staging posts and the next election is key one. We’ll need candidates in every region of the country. Our aim is clear – the best SDP result in a generation. I’ve always been realistic with you. That’s achievable.\nYes – it is a Long March but we’ll get there. Why? Because there’s a lot to love about the SDP: our history, the strength of our philosophical foundations. Our loyalty to each other – even in foul weather. The fact that Rod Liddle says the sound of red wine being poured into a glass is the sound of the SDP… But most of all it’s because our political offer is unique. A party that defends free speech, knows what a woman is but also knows what a national housing programme is, what industry is, what animal rights are and what a national border is. That’s a powerful combination and no one else can offer it. No other party offers left-leaning economics and respect for tradition. Frankly, we are better social democrats than Labour and we’d conserve more than the Tories.\nThese are challenging times for the country we love. I have an uncomfortable feeling that Liz Truss will not be leading us to the border of heaven. People need something better and they’ll find it in the SDP.\nWe’ve proved we can win. My advice? Keep going. Win again.\nShame I couldn’t get to Manchester for the Party Conference the rail strike’s put the skids on that sooner than later the British people will finally turn on the failed liblabconsnp and consign them to history the SDP is that alternative Government, Starmer will be as disastrous as Truss if He were to ever win a general election again Truss will be gone by the spring replaced by Sunak,the SDP must get it’s act and message together\nThe Conservatives and Labour parties need to be swept away permanently We as a Country can no longer continue to tolerate Sunak and Hunt or a woeful Starmer led Labour party,I have regularly written letters in my local newspaper and national newspapers promoting the Social Democratic Party to encourage people to turn away from the 3 tired old parties or waste time with the Poundland Thatcher tribute act Reform Party\nThe SDP was founded during 1981 at a time when the country was crying out for a new political party and political leaders. Jump forward to 2023 and the same demand is being made now its the time for the SDP to re emerge offering hope over despair.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_housing-crisis-local-authority-finances-solution-devon/content_53.html": "An Englishman’s home is his castle! There is no place like home! Other cliches are available!\nAsk the common man or woman on the street what are the most important things in their lives and their family and homes are likely to make the top two.\nWe are all well aware that there is a housing crisis, not just in this country but across much of the western world, with sky high property prices being driven by supply and demand: too few homes being chased by too many people.\nShould governments turn around tomorrow and put an end to mass immigration then perhaps there is a chance that the supply-demand formula will eventually correct itself. But given that is an implausible future then we must build more homes at a far greater rate than we currently do.\nSo far, so uncontroversial – right?\nThere is a significant source of untapped potential funding to once again kickstart local housebuilding that is not being utilised: local authority balance sheets.\nAs an example, Devon County Council has £20million in cash deposited in loans to third party councils with a loan duration of three years; a further £96million in cash deposited in shorter duration loans to a variety of third party councils and financial institutions including to foreign owned banks; and a further £56million in investments in financial companies such as Blackrock and Aberdeen Global.\nWhilst it is prudent to hold cash investments as a reserve fund for councils for a variety of reasons – such as smoothing over income fluctuations and responding to emergencies – are these reserves being used in the most appropriate manner given our current and acute housing crisis? Furthermore, why invest in commercial property like Exeter Science Park Ltd but not residential housing?\nThere are currently in the south west around 130,000 households awaiting a social housing place and in Devon, excluding Plymouth and Torbay, there are over 8.5k households on the waiting list.\nParts of the south west are some of the poorest in the entire nation with few quality job prospects, poor infrastructure, low life expectancy and poor health.\nInvesting in residential property will not be a panacea for all of the regions ills, but it would produce an income, retain or increase in capital value (historically accurate over the long term) and help alleviate the housing crisis for some of the most vulnerable people in society.\nThis is a moral way to allocate public finances, a pragmatic one and a way for local communities to show the national government the importance and urgent need for a nation state controlled housebuilding programme.",

It’s a great day for the resurgent SDP and a great day for social democracy. We believe that millions of British people will support the communitarian approach to politics in our New Declaration. The SDP has been quietly building membership all over the country and we’ve had a fantastic response to the New Declaration.\nOur aim is to provide a political home to all social democrats who seek a stronger more capable state along with greater individual responsibility, trust and social solidarity.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2020_12_30_social-democrats-welcome-eu-trade-agreement/content_537.html": "30th December, 2020 – The SDP broadly welcomes the agreement reached between the European Union and the UK Government, and acknowledges it as a vital step in the restoration of national sovereignty.\nSDP leader William Clouston says: “The conclusion of a UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) is the culmination of years of struggle for Britain to re-establish its independence and in doing so to restore the bond between government and people. As nation-state democrats, our fundamental concern has been whether the British public can elect and remove officials who preside over our lives and our nation. I now believe, going forward, that this is finally the case.\n“I’m on the record in arguing for a different post-Brexit outcome, namely, a WTO arrangement with a degree of trade friction. Tariffs, I believe, would have presented the UK with a rare opportunity to totally reset the terms of trade with the EU and help reverse the UK’s colossal goods trade deficit, which stands at nearly £100bn. Nevertheless, the deal agreed by the Johnson government is sufficient – with the right policies – to enable the UK to build a more sustainable, productive, re-industrialised and equitable economy, which the SDP seeks.\n“Those of us who fought so hard for the 2016 vote to be honoured are entitled to feel some satisfaction that democracy has prevailed. Looking to the future we must, as a nation, put our differences behind us, work together and make the very best of our opportunities in the years ahead.”\nSDP Brexit spokesman Patrick O’Flynn added: “Boris Johnson and the UK chief negotiator David Frost deserve credit for achieving this deal, especially given the disgraceful betrayal of Brexit that had earlier been set in motion by Theresa May’s administration.\n“It is far from perfect, in that it delays a meaningful revival of the UK fishing fleet and potentially compromises Britain’s ability to reduce its trade deficit in goods via policies that support a domestic industrial revival. But it does pass the essential sovereignty test which has always been the absolute crux of Brexit, and it therefore finally honours the verdict of the British people of June 23, 2016. There have been many times over recent years when such an outcome seemed in great jeopardy.\n“It certainly could not have been achieved had the Prime Minister followed the advice of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats by ruling out ending the transition period without a deal. Such a course would have left this country a passive recipient of whatever crumbs Brussels had chosen to offer, if any.\n“As a patriotic party of the common-sense centre-ground, the SDP is proud to give its backing to this long overdue restoration of democratic accountability within the nation state. We look forward to playing our part in helping Britain go from strength to strength in the years ahead.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_wild-and-dangerous-why-britains-money-men-must-go/content_355.html": "Imagine you’ve contracted an architect to design your dream house. The architect then employs contractors to build it and the house falls down. Do you blame the architect? For sure. But the architect complains: ‘I didn’t know the wind could be like this.’ But what if you’d approved the design, because it looked lovely, but it had no foundations, and had a roof resting on non-load-bearing walls? Do you only blame the architect?\nThe disaster breaking over Britain’s economy is the responsibility of not just the Bank of England governor, but the entire governing financial and economic establishment. The Bank’s governor cut an abject figure when he told MPs he felt ‘helpless’ to contain inflation. But he also embodied a terrible lack of accountability, or even professional honour. If the Bank of England’s governor tells us he cannot control inflation, then the correct response is to thank him for his work, accept his resignation, and find someone who can do the job. This should happen without delay.\nBut the clear-out cannot stop there. Despite Conservative MPs howling, it is inconceivable that the Bank could have embarked on the largest QE operation in Britain’s peacetime history without having cleared it with the Treasury, and with the Government. The Chancellor and the senior stratum of the Treasury civil service are therefore equally culpable, and should be gone as soon as is practically possible.\nFor let us remember just what the Treasury’s ‘economic strategy’ has been. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Treasury opted for a wildly unconventional set of policies: massive fiscal stimulus accompanied by massive monetary stimulus. This combination of fiscal and monetary largesse was something Britain managed to avoid even during wartime. Moreover, it was neither inevitable nor necessary: as we wrote at the time, the pandemic’s huge and extraordinary government deficit could and should have been financed by targetted public-bond sale campaigns, with the debt ring-fenced via a 60-year sinking fund. Had this strategy been pursued (or even imagined), the excesses of QE would have been avoided, and the temptation to ‘normalise’ fiscal balances immediately by tax rises would have been avoided.\nFor when the pandemic retreated, in a screeching U-turn, the Treasury reversed its wildly unconventional pandemic policies to pursue a financial and economic policies so ortho-orthodox they have no followers anywhere in the world. Quite suddenly, fiscal rectitude was to be re-established by huge tax rises, even as the Bank of England tightened monetary policy. Anywhere and everywhere, if you sharply tighten fiscal policy at the same time as you are tightening monetary policy, you court recession. Which, incidentally, will leave a red imprint on your budget deficit. The fact we’ve got such dangerous drivers manically swinging the wheel this way and that is one reason why the pound is weakening. No-one wants to be a passenger in a fish-tailing taxi.\nLet us call this what it is: it is cruel and brutal stupidity which is doing great damage to Britain. Those at the top of the Treasury should be given their inflation-proofed pensions right now. Their leadership has been disastrous not just in the normal quotidian ways we have come to expect to suffer (think of the contribution of the Treasury’s Green Book to regional inequalities). Rather, the swing from wild and dangerous unconventional behaviour to wild and dangerous ultra-conventional behaviour suggests an economic leadership that has no stable intellectual underpinnings, no useful imagination, and last but most importantly, no genuine care for the society it purports to serve.\nMeanwhile, our economic establishment is still loving their repudiation of responsibility. For as the inflation gales gather strength, the Treasury thinks that now is a good time to put a new carbon tax on imports. Is this mere stupidity, or actual economic malice? Lucy Frazer is Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and that she is prepared to go to bat for this plan tells us she is yet another branch of the problem. Similarly, in this environment, the ‘Safeguarding Minister’ Rachel Maclean tells us we should be beating the cost-of-living crisis by working longer hours or getting a better job. Way to go, Minister: that’s how to deal with Britain’s productivity problem!\n“Those at the top of the Treasury should be given their inflation-proofed pensions right now.”\nThis is a major part of the problem. Those taking the decisions are completely insulated from the consequences of their actions.\nImagine if, before they voted it mandatory for everyone else, all MPs had been forced to strip out their existing central heating systems and buy (at their own expense), fit and run heat-pumps for a year. Just to see how effective and cost-effective they really are.\nSeems to me when it comes to this sort of thing, it is reasonable for MPs to trial these things, at their own expense, so they can legitimately claim a degree of knowledge and even expertise before they legislate for this sort of thing.\nThink ‘Partygate’, only serious.\nGovernor Bailey and the current chancellor need to be made to Write their resignation letters so must the reckless spendthrift Chancer sitting in number 10 downing Street We have the Worst Government in living memory as well as the Worst opposition of all time, the Social Democratic Party must be congratulated on its electoral success in Leeds recently, the SDP must be the alternative Her Majesty’s Government and opposition\nThis Government is inept and We must be witnessing the end of the Johnson premiership with luck\nThe SDP can be that alternative Government to the Tories and Labour both parties are proven failures the UK needs change We are seeing the end of both Johnson and Starmer\nWhen looking to hire a civil servant for a top job, a prerequisite of the interview should be to investigate the shambles they are choosing to leave. and by god the FCA is in an absolute shambles.\nFor me the job of bank of England governor has always been a bit to much of a golden handshake job.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2025_02_08_sdp-leader-pledges-a-public-inquiry-into-labours-chagos-islands-capitulation/content_210.html": "The Leader of the SDP, William Clouston, has roundly condemned the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary over their humiliating surrender of British sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, the harm to our national security interests and the pledging of billions of pounds to another state as part of this capitulation.\nFurthermore, Clouston pledges that a future SDP government would launch a public inquiry into the actions of the government with a view, if necessary, of initiating a subsequent criminal investigation.\nHe calls on the leaders of all other political parties to make the same pledge.\nClouston said:\n“I am appalled by the government’s unseemly and humiliating desperation to shed sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, formally known as the British Indian Ocean Territory.\n“These 1,000 islands, far from being insignificant dots on the map, have been British sovereign territory, and their people British subjects, for over two hundred years. They include 240,000 square miles of Exclusive Economic Zone waters, marine protected areas and are home to a strategic military base which enables both the United Kingdom and the United States to maintain the security of the Indian Ocean region and numerous international shipping lanes.\n“Yet, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary aren’t trying to sell the islands, nor even to give them away. Unbelievably, they’re offering a reported £18 billion of UK taxpayers’ money – your money – to Mauritius to receive the territory from Britain.\n“Does the Prime Minister really expect the British people to believe that their national interests are best served by paying Mauritius UK taxpayers’ money to adopt sovereignty over a British territory, subjects and strategic military assets? As I said in my recent speech to the Durham Union – giving away the Chagos Islands and paying for the privilege is one of the most disgraceful things that has happened in British policy for decades. It’s absolutely outrageous.\nLINK: https://x.com/WilliamClouston/status/1886919823667442046\n“We in the SDP have very serious concerns about this entire degrading debacle, but even greater concerns that it send a dangerous signal to the rest of the world that Britain will no longer protect its other territories and interests abroad.”\n“For that reason, I pledge that a future SDP government would move to ensure the world understands that the United Kingdom will protect its territories and interests, and will launch a public inquiry into the whole sorry affair of the Chagos Islands negotiations with a view, if necessary, of initiating a subsequent criminal investigations. I call on other party leaders to make the same pledge.”\nNOTE:\nThe SDP notes that the International Court of Justice and UN General Assembly votes to demand the UK relinquish sovereignty are non binding. Both relied largely on the right to self-determination, a matter easily addressed if the government were to engage with the Chagossian people who are British subjects and wish to remain so. Foreign Office ministers have repeatedly claimed the Chagossians have been consulted throughout. This has been denied by the Chagossians themselves.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2023_11_27_sdp-wales-statement-on-gb-news-ban/content_292.html": "The Social Democratic Party wholeheartedly condemns the decision to suspend GB News from the Senedd. The channel has played a pivotal role in providing an alternative voice – including our own – to the Welsh public. We’re one of the smaller political parties in Wales, and as such have tirelessly strived to present an alternative perspective. GB News has been a crucial platform for our party leader, William Clouston, through interviews since its establishment.\nWhile we acknowledge concerns surrounding certain comments made by contributors to GB News, the suggestion that Senedd staff need to be protected from these contributions in future appears to be unfounded as the people involved in making divisive rhetoric were dismissed. The dismissals demonstrated to us in the SDP that such behaviour is not accepted by the channel. We intend to continue to appear on the channel when invited in order to engage in discussion and debate. With an impending independent review of available channels in the Senedd, we urge the reviewer to consider the broader implications for political diversity and the ability of smaller parties, like the Social Democratic Party, to communicate their vision to the people of Wales.\nOur commitment to providing a choice for the people is firmly rooted in policies that align with the core values of our party, as outlined on the front page of our website. The Social Democratic Party stands for a generation-long ‘mass immigration pause’ to promote integration and social cohesion, reducing net migration to 50,000 per annum. Additionally, we advocate for withdrawing from international agreements, including the 1951 UN refugee convention and the ECHR, to reassert UK border sovereignty.\nOur commitment to social welfare extends to housing policies, where we propose the establishment of a British Housing Corporation (BHC) to oversee and fund the construction of 100,000 social homes annually. We also aim to introduce legislation to enhance security of tenure and encourage longer-term tenancies in the private rented sector.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-abominations-of-lionel-shiver/content_451.html": "Lionel Shriver is the acclaimed writer of novels including ‘We Need to Talk About Kevin’, ‘Should We Stay Or Should We Go’ and ‘The Mandibles’. But her latest book, ‘Abominations’ (The Borough Press), is the first collection of her non-fiction writing – a ‘best of’ some of her most compelling, entertaining and wonderfully argumentative articles as a latter-day cultural commentator, always ready to poke holes in 21st century orthodoxy.\nSDPTalks: You write in ‘Abominations’ of a time in which an article of yours was misconstrued, subsequent attempts to make your point clearer only seeming to dig the hole a little deeper. And that you learned from that experience not to attempt to explain ever again. Has that stood you in good stead?\nLIONEL SHRIVER: I was referring to a phenomenon which has become all to common now by which you write something or say something which is entirely discernible to the vast majority of your audience but the people who disagree with you distort it into what they wish you had said, all the better to attack you. The mistake I’ve made in the past and no longer make is to try to explain myself better – as if the problem to begin with was some kind of obscurity about the initial statement. Well, no… The initial statement was perfectly clear and wilfully distorted by people who can’t take you on in the terms that you were speaking or writing. There’s no defence against that.\nSDPTalks: And that’s a problem for our discourse right?\nLS: That’s a problem anyone writing about sensitive subjects faces because no matter how much nuance you try to bring to a subject like, say, immigration, it’s going to get twisted. If by any chance you suggest that immigration ought to be slowed a tad, you’re going to get called a racist. It doesn’t matter how you explain yourself – it’s completely pointless. This is a danger for all writers – and for that matter for anyone who ever says anything to anyone – because when what you say can be maliciously distorted into what you didn’t say then there’s no point saying anything right? Words then are no longer functioning. It’s a constant problem. When I write a column I make an effort and hedge against what I don’t mean, but it’s a complete waste of effort because we’re dealing with a highly polarised environment. I’m interested in writing about subjects that are difficult, sensitive, that risk being misinterpreted and sometimes I’m dismayed that it’s seems so pointless. The people I write for largely agree with me anyway so you have that ‘preaching to the choir’ problem. And the people who disagree with me don’t read what I say.\nSDPTalks: Isn’t it social media that gives this deliberate misinterpretation its potency?\nLS: Social media is a great facilitator because it makes it possible to cut and paste lines out of context, which seems like a small sin but is actually enormous in its ability to distort – and in fact you can completely change the meaning of a line if you lift it just willy-nilly out of a paragraph. There’s no quality control – only it seems on misinformation, which is itself now a highly politicised concept.\nSDPTalks: You say in ‘Abominations’ how in the US you’re considered to have these rather “kooky” viewpoints. But presumably that’s just about the left-leaning….\nLS: My kooky positions, which I think we could now summarise as ‘anti-woke’ – and I know that’s a boring label but nobody has come up with another one – have actually become more legitimised. I can’t say we’re better organised but we [anti-wokesters] are more numerous and have more outlets through which we can push back. I think it’s the woke brigade who are the real kooks – you know when you put yourself in a position whereby you don’t believe in biological sex, I think that kind of puts you on the fringes. The weird thing is that I give expression to what are largely mainstream views, even on subjects like affirmative action, which I’m vociferously opposed to. That has majority opposition even among black Americans – they don’t like it, because discrimination to eliminate discrimination seems absurd and ends up creating as much injustice as it seeks to solve. It’s had all kind of pernicious effects, creates the impression that minorities need help – and that’s a horrible prejudice to encourage. Likewise mass uncontrolled immigration – [which] creates a sense of chaos, that there’s no distinction between your country and the rest of the world, that you’re this porous blob with no coherent identity. Most people [agree with that assessment], including a lot of immigrants. Most immigrants don’t want a flood of people from elsewhere who are not integrated easily and who initially are likely to be heavily dependent – this is another normal view but positions that are no longer acceptable on the left. They’ve become demonised. Normal people pick them up and become sensitive to the idea that you’re not supposed to say certain things anymore so keep their mouths shut. So I open my mouth for them. But I’m not an extremist. What’s odd is how these mainstream views have come to be thought of as kooky.\nSDPTalks: You’re well-established as an important voice in fiction. Is your relatively late flourishing as a commentator a surprise to you?\nLS: I think I am surprised. It just wasn’t my ambition starting out to be a commentator on current affairs. I wanted to be a novelist and was very single-minded about that. It was only in the 90s when my earnings as a novelist became pitiful and I needed to supplement my income that I started participating in journalism, initially on a radio show in Northern Ireland and on Northern Irish affairs – as one of the only American unionists on the island – for the ‘Wall Street Journal’. And little by little I found that I wasn’t just doing it for money but actually enjoyed it. Living in Northern Ireland re-politicised me. I was very political as a teenager but it was the tail-end of the 60s so hard not to be – I was very much the left-wing Democrat. But when that era passed I was mostly involved in the pursuit of fiction writing and went through a good decade of only sporadically reading a newspaper. I didn’t watch the TV news – and now I’m addicted to it, I’m embarrassed to say. But politics was the lifeblood of Belfast so I got stuck in – up to my neck – and in some sense never got out. And yet I never set out to be a commentator. But if anything survives of my work it’s going to be my novels. I work harder on those. I think they make more of a cultural contribution.\nSDPTalks: What do you get from writing comment pieces that is harder to achieve through fiction?\nLS: I like the immediacy of it, that being in the moment. But I think in ways one of the my most controversial articles in ‘Abominations’ isn’t so time-based and that’s the one on taxation, because it talks about what it feels like to have most of your money taken away, in a given year, when, in my case, my single windfall year was actually the culmination of my entire career. That was something I’d been working towards my whole life – and then it turns out that actually you’ve been working for other people. It creates resentment and a resentment you’re not allowed to express, which is the most poisonous kind. Tax authorities think they can pass any laws and people will just get with the program but actually this is emotionally incendiary and when you cross a certain statistical line in terms of confiscating people’s earnings you motivate cheating, because people think it’s unfair, and actively disincentivises work. Treasuries never want to believe that no matter how much they take from you there isn’t a point where you’ll just fold your arms and say ‘alright, I’m not going to do it anymore’. But I did experience that. I refused to take journalistic gigs just for the money – it needed to give me an opportunity to say something I wanted to say or I wouldn’t take the work. Life is bigger than politics thank god – and in some ways I’ve allowed the political to take up too much space in my life and I’m probably not the only person who feels that, but it has been such a strange period.\nSDPTalks: You’ve spoken of the tendency for political commentating now to be necessarily stripped of humour or playfulness in order to further dodge the misconstruing we’ve already spoken of. Does that bother you?\nLS: Well I keep making jokes. It’s just compulsive. The most valuable thing about my latter journalistic career has been that I can be funny in print and editors don’t take all the amusing lines out. When I was younger and had very little clout and had to subject myself to heavy-handed editors – the ‘Wall Street Journal’ was especially vicious about taking out anything frivolous, or playful – nowadays I get to speak with my full voice. And I love that. I’ve always found that when an editor takes out all the fun stuff I can no longer identify with the article. I no longer have any feeling for it. That alienation from your own text is an ugly process.\nSDPTalks: Do you feel it’s getting easier to speak your mind without fall-out, not just for you as a writer, but in general?\nLS: Saying the unsayable is getting easier – slightly. The best test of that has to be transgenderism. That’s a fad that has done nothing but grown more disturbing for me, both for individuals and for society at large, I think it’s decadent and a dead-end for young people trying to find out who they are. I’ve never found my sex particularly informative about who I am or how I should spend my life. It’s a technical factual detail that doesn’t interest me. And it’s become possible to say these things in public, but when this craze first hit – in around 2012 – the tsunami of documentaries and celebratory articles came with the conceit that any kind of criticism would be career death. You’d be a ‘transphobe’. Now you can publish whole books critical of the ideology and that’s a change for the better. That latitude helps expand the latitude we should extend to other topics too.\nSDPTalks: Do you ever feel like you’re gambling with your livelihood?\nLS: That’s the danger. That’s the gamble – that I may publish the one column that does for me, that makes me unpublishable in fiction. I don’t think that’s a calculated risk on my part. I don’t want to be intimated out of writing non-fiction. But I don’t want to back off from it because I’m scared. It’s easy for me to say I’ll risk being cancelled because what I’ve got to say is so bloody important because I haven’t been cancelled. I’ve come close to becoming persona non grata, but it hasn’t happened yet. And if it did I’d feel that grievously. I think I’d feel stupid.\nSDPTalks: You’ve spoken of your habit of catastophising. So is it all that bad?\nLS: Well I can’t let go of my biggest concern – and it’s not climate change. It’s money, the global financial system. We’re closer to global financial meltdown than ever. If you have these super debts and a realisation that nobody is going to pay them back, then currency doesn’t function anymore. And that makes me extremely anxious. But the impulse to catastophise only grows more intense as I get older. There’s a passage in ‘The Mandibles’ about how old people are by nature apocalyptic because they’re facing a private apocalypse. They instinctively project that onto the rest of the world. And there’s a sub-section of those people who like the idea of taking the rest of the world with them. But catastrophising is a narrative entertainment. There’s a certain kind of ending in fiction in which everything blows up. And it’s a cool, satisfying ending. I’m attracted to that kind of narrative. It’s orgasmic…\nThe SDP should and could be the next Government of the UK the Conservatives may just cling on unreservedly but it’s Starmer’s Labour for being so abysmal as an useless opposition which offers nothing new as alternative Government I believe that the British public are tired of the 3 old parties\nThis may be a two party country, however those parties need not be Labour Conservative or ether,\nI just came across this article and was surprised by the lack of comments. So for the record I’d like to say this reader found both q’s and a’s entertaining and very thought provoking. Generally I found myself in agreement with Lionel S. What l’ve also noticed in recent years is that it’s become harder to admit to having second thoughts about sensitive subjects, based on the outcomes of various well-meant ideas ( e.g. mixed ability teaching) that turned out to have been a mistake, good in theory but too difficult to put into practice without massive resources. And don’t get me started on mass immigration and the failure of integration…\nPretty sure nobody will read this but l enjoyed getting it off my chest!\nKeith",

The abuse of antibiotics, pesticides and nitrate fertilisers have made farming neither economically secure nor ecologically viable.\nWe’ve become a country of food banks and yet over 25% of food is wasted in the home and 9% before leaving the farm gate. Obesity and diabetes are rocketing and yet some people go hungry. We must stop deceiving ourselves. We must face the fact that this is both an economic and a cultural problem – the marker of a throwaway society.\nThe primary causes of our difficulties – ignored for a generation by our political class – relate to the structure of our farming and food systems and the incentives they apply. The solutions lie in facing up to the true cost of good food, the value of ecological restoration and the necessity of trade policies aimed at greater national food security.\nLike the power of nature itself to regenerate I have no doubt that we can transform our system into one in which the countryside recovers, rural communities thrive, and our citizens consume locally-sourced, healthier food.\nA re-think is overdue and while the benefits of a re-balanced system will take time to bear fruit, the ideas contained in this serious report are an important step forward.\nWilliam Clouston\nParty Leader\nSocial Democratic Party\nEXECUTIVE\nSUMMARY\nBritain’s food system is broken. For every £1 we spend on food, we spend another £1 in hidden costs. These costs are externalised into areas that don’t appear on the balance sheet – health, environment, animal welfare, and the wellbeing of food producers and wider rural communities. Successive governments have sacrificed long-term prosperity – our natural capital – for short-term gain.\nWe propose a holistic approach to restore nature, revitalise rural communities, ensure food security and improve the national diet.\nIn this paper we present a suite of policies to achieve the following four targets.\n1. Affordable healthy food and fair prices to producers\n- Establishment of Charter Co-ops, Regional Marketing Boards and infrastructure grants to improve local food resilience and sustainability.\n- Tax on wholesale purchase of sugar and salt by food producers. Restrict promotion and advertising of unhealthy food.\n- Free school lunches for every child. Practical home economics and cooking classes.\n2. Sustainable farming and environmental restoration\n- Target subsidies to enable farmers to produce food sustainably with help from ‘Farmer Champions’ and guarantee this support for as long as it is needed.\n- Maintain at least 90% of existing farmland for agriculture, and target nature restoration projects to non-food producing land and least-productive farmland.\n- Support research into science, technology and innovation to make high-yield farming less environmentally damaging and small-scale farming more efficient.\n3. Thriving rural communities and a small farm future\n- Provide affordable housing ring-fenced for local working families and invest in rural infrastructure and policing.\n- Re-establish land-based colleges, increase apprenticeships in rural trades and strengthen integration of food and farming into the school curriculum.\n- Restore diversity of farm size across the UK.\n4. Food security in a global market\n- Ensure that trade deals do not disadvantage British food producers.\n- Establish a Buy British policy for public sector procurement, with an emphasis on local sourcing.\n- Clear country of origin and animal welfare labelling on both raw and processed foods\nBRITAIN’S\nFOOD SYSTEM\nCheap food has hidden costs\nIn the 1950s people in the UK spent half their income on food. For the past decade household expenditure on food has been between 10-11% of income. The reduced cost of food in real terms was achieved through a combination of intensive farming, global free trade, free movement of labour and a competitive retail market.\nBut for every £1 we spend on food, we spend another £1 in hidden costs (1). These costs are externalised into areas that don’t appear on the balance sheet – health, environment, animal welfare, and the wellbeing of food producers and wider rural communities.\nOur natural environment is in a terrible state. Increasing agricultural intensification, demanded for decades by the prevailing political and market conditions, has led to declining biodiversity, loss and fragmentation of habitats, polluted rivers and degraded soils.\nPublic health is poor. Over 60% of UK adults are overweight or obese, conditions which are more prevalent amongst lower-income sections of society and predicted to increase (2). Diet-related ailments reduce economic productivity and cost the NHS over £6 billion a year (3). Ultra-processed foods, which are associated with increased risk of diet-related disease, comprise over 50% of the UK’s diet, a far higher proportion than in other European countries (4). Overuse of antibiotics in food production presents a potentially devastating global health risk. Increasing detachment from nature impacts our mental and physical wellbeing.\nFood has been devalued. Over a quarter of food grown in the UK is wasted. Households throw away 4.5million tons of food every year, accounting for 70% of the food wasted after it leaves the farm. Nearly16% of the average household grocery budget is spent on food which ends up in the bin (5).\nRural and coastal communities are in decline. Mechanisation of farming coupled with the use of cheap migrant labour has had a significant impact on rural populations. Villages which were once thriving hubs have suffered closures of schools, pubs, post offices and shops. Local families have been pushed out by a combination of rising house prices and lack of work. The rise in second homes and holiday lets has seen some areas hollowed out and empty for half of the year. Rural crime is increasing rapidly,costing nearly £50m per year and putting additional pressure on farming families (6).\nFarmers are struggling. Almost every type of farm, regardless of size, makes more money from subsidies than from food production. The bureaucracy and inconsistency of the subsidy system has been a source of frustration and demotivation for decades. Post-Brexit, the transition to a new system requires increased form-filling for reduced income, while uncertainty and delays have left farmers unable to plan for the future. Politicians urge farmers to adopt less damaging practices, while signing new trade deals that force them to compete against countries with lower environmental and animal welfare standards.\nUnsurprisingly, farmers increasingly feel betrayed, undervalued and demonised. Research shows that 94% of farmers under the age of 40 rate poor mental health as the biggest problem facing the sector today (7).\nAll this for cheap food. And as we are now discovering, cheap food is no longer guaranteed.\nIn 2022, UK food prices rose to a 45 year high. Rising energy costs and reduced availability of grain following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have driven global food price inflation. The Covid-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the UK’s food system, notably the length and complexity of supply chains and reduced capacity in domestic food production (8).\nEnvironmental impacts arising from intensification are starting to threaten future food production. Three quarters of the crop types we grow rely on pollination by insects, whose numbers have declined drastically due to pesticide use and habitat destruction. Chemical fertilisers played a key role in increasing yields and reducing prices, but their sustained use over decades is polluting watercourses and weakening soils to an extent that could ultimately threaten food security (9).\nSuccessive governments have sacrificed long-term prosperity – our natural capital – for short-term gain. They have favoured free-market liberalism over protecting the interests of British citizens. And now, the myopic focus on reducing domestic carbon emissions threatens our food production sector through the imposition of arbitrary targets, while diverting resources from environmental issues we could actually address.\nIt’s time for change\n“A strong food system can underpin a strong society, having a profound impact on the nation’s health, happiness and overall prosperity. Sustainably producing our food can shape our countryside and landscapes, boosting biodiversity and regenerating wildlife. Our food system can be instrumental in positively shaping our nation and our lives.”\nThe Broken Plate 2023: The State of the Nation’s Food System\nWe propose a long-term holistic approach to restore nature, ensure food security and improve the national diet. In this paper we present a suite of policies to:\n- Support farmers to produce food sustainably and ensure this support is guaranteed for as long as it is needed. Ultimately, we aim to remove dependence on subsidies by aiding transition to more profitable farming methods and ensuring producers are paid a fair price.\n- Stimulate demand for, and supply of, healthy, locally-sourced food through education and market interventions.\n- Invest in science, technology and farmer-led research to increase yields while minimising environmental impacts and reducing reliance on imports.\n- Reinvigorate rural communities through investment in infrastructure, housing and vocational training.\nAs with all SDP policies, we prioritise the interests of communities and families.\nFamilies on low incomes spend a far larger proportion of their household budget on food than those on higher incomes. Measures to improve environmental sustainability must not disadvantage consumers, especially the poorest in society. Until recently, the availability of ever-cheaper food has helped to mask social inequalities caused by de-industrialisation, mass immigration and neo-liberal economic policies. Addressing the social ills caused by these policies, for example by increasing wages and reducing housing costs, would mean that food prices could rise to reflect the genuine cost of food production without causing hardship.\nWe reject calls for drastic, authoritarian measures and arbitrary deadlines. UK ecosystems have evolved with farming in the mix. Farmers must be at the centre of environmental restoration, but they must be adequately recompensed and protected from unfair competition.\nChange is never easy, but it is necessary and it is achievable. The SDP seeks the common good in Britain’s national interest. Fixing our broken food system is crucial to ensuring the welfare, prosperity and security of British people.\nTARGET 1\nAFFORDABLE,\nHEALTHY FOOD\nAND FAIR PRICES\nTO PRODUCERS\nBetween 2022 and 2023, food retail prices rose by nearly 20%, the sharpest increase since 1977. This hit the poorest sections of society especially hard, but these communities were already facing significant obstacles to buying and preparing good quality, nutritious food. Deprived areas are frequently ‘food deserts’ characterised by a lack of shops selling fresh ingredients, or ‘food swamps’ defined by an excess of outlets selling high-calorie, low-nutrient food. Living in a food desert or food swamp has serious health implications, particularly during childhood when it can harm development and influence the formation of long-term eating habits (10). Over a third of people on low incomes feel that healthy and nutritious food is unaffordable in the UK (11).\nThe speed and scale of recent food inflation has been a shock to consumers, but the cost of growing food has increased far more steeply over the same period than the cost of buying it. This reduction in farmers’ margins is part of a longer-term trend. For decades, the cost of inputs such as fertiliser and animal feed has increased at roughly twice the rate of food prices to consumers. This has been a key factor contributing to the ongoing loss of British farming businesses, particularly our small family farms. One in five farms in England closed down between 2005 and 2015, the number rising to one in three of the smaller farms (12).\nFree markets make a vital contribution to a successful economy, but markets are justified by their social function. Making healthy food affordable for all while ensuring farmers are paid a fair price is a vital goal which has eluded successive governments, but it can be achieved in a social market economy.\nMaking supermarkets part of the solution\nAny plan to improve Britain’s food system for both consumers and producers needs to start with our supermarkets. From the 1960s, the availability of a wide variety of affordable, fresh produce under one roof revolutionised people’s lives and was particularly liberating for women. Supermarkets now control over 95% of the UK grocery retail market, with just under 75% of market share held by the top five chains (13). But convenience comes at a significant cost in terms of impacts on suppliers and on public health.\nSupermarkets have been widely criticised for using their cartel-like power to force suppliers to accept extremely low prices and unfavourable contractual terms. Farmers make less than a penny of profit on many everyday purchases such as bread, cheese and meat products (14) . Orders are frequently cancelled at the last minute, often due to the supermarket finding a cheaper source overseas. Huge quantities of perfectly good produce are rejected for aesthetic reasons. Contracts routinely push all the risks onto suppliers; one in five farmers incurred significant costs because of inaccurate forecasting by retailers in 2022-2023 (15).\nSupermarkets are well aware of the public’s desire to support British farmers; they use this widely in their marketing campaigns. However, reality often fails to live up to the patriotic slogans and advertisements, such as when Asda and Sainsbury’s recently abandoned their Buy British commitments to purchase 400 tons of beef imported from Poland.\nPromotion in supermarkets through high-visibility displays and special offers has been shown to have considerable influence on purchasing decisions, but to date unhealthy foods are more likely to be promoted. More insidiously, Britain’s leading supermarkets were found to have been marketing foods high in salt and saturated fat as ‘healthy options’ via product labelling and in-store displays (16).\nThe prominence of supermarkets means they have unparalleled potential to bring about positive change. Genuine commitments to prioritise British suppliers and promote their products to consumers through labelling, in-store display and online shopping filters would have great social and economic benefits. Promotional offers and honest labelling of healthy foods would help consumers to make informed and affordable choices.\nWe propose to establish an independent regulatory body for supermarkets, with powers to impose fines for bad conduct and award tax rebates and recognition for good conduct.\nWe will initiate a review of the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (2010) to ensure it continues to provide adequate protection to supermarket suppliers in light of geopolitical and technological changes. We will increase monitoring and enforcement to ensure compliance with the Code.\nRevitalising local food networks\nThe majority of farmers are keen to have access to locally based infrastructure and to shift partly or fully to farmer-focussed supply chains. In one study, over 50% said they would like to join or start a co-operative buying group, with a further 25% saying they would consider this (14). Professionals throughout the food and farming sector would like to see greater collaboration, with 90% supporting shorter, local food supply chains and more diverse UK food production (17).\nConsumers, too, are hungry for change. During the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of British people started buying from alternative outlets such as veg box schemes, local food partnerships or farm shops, and 85% said they would like to continue these shopping habits (18).\nThere are excellent examples of local, often community-led, initiatives forging better and more sustainable connections between producers and consumers, but these are currently too few and far between. Despite the desire for collaboration, the low numbers and consequent isolation of those working in agriculture make this difficult to achieve. The burden of subsidy paperwork is another barrier, leaving farmers little time to think about working together to gain better access to market and fairer prices.\nTo overcome these challenges, we will incentivise and support farmers, fishers and growers to form regional Charter Co-operatives. Run by members for members, these will act like guilds to improve sustainability and find collective ways to add value and achieve stable, viable prices. Their establishment will be informed by research into the most successful co-operative movements in other countries.\nSHOWCASE\nConnecting producers and consumers\nUnicorn Co-op, Manchester makes its staple foods cheaper than those sold in supermarkets out of a commitment to make organic food affordable to all. They buy directly from local farms and contribute 1% of revenue to a growers’ fund, which gives farmers grants for equipment and infrastructure. They pay on time and work closely with suppliers to forecast need and plan future orders. They support consumers by providing information on healthy cooking using seasonal produce.\nC’est qui le patron? (Who’s the Boss?), France is a co-op which has achieved remarkable success in recent years, initially in the struggling small-scale organic dairy sector and now more widely. Small farmers buy a share in the business for €1 and run informative marketing campaigns to consumers. This has allowed them to set their own, viable, prices while still farming in a nature-sensitive way.\nThe Small Food Bakery, Nottingham uses seasonal ingredients bought directly from local farmers, with a particular focus on supporting small-scale agroecological farming. Bakery owner Kimberley Bell also set up UK Grain Lab which brings together researchers, growers and food producers to share knowledge and advance a more innovative and sustainable UK-based grain economy.\nStreet Goat Initiative, Bristol is a community project that raises goats for milk and meat on unused urban land. Families take an active role in the dairy, enabling milk to be sold at below supermarket prices while covering all costs, and building a connection between local people, their food and the wider environment.\nThe Food Circle, York is a social enterprise that makes healthy food available to residents in one of the most deprived areas of the city. They provide free labour to farmers at harvest times in return for some of the harvest for them to sell on and process to add value. They work with small-scale local producers and run a twice-weekly market selling staple products at affordable prices. By providing cooking and food-growing classes, preparing shared meals and running events for children in school holidays they are empowering the local community to be healthier and happier.\nBy signing up to the Charter, members will commit to working towards regenerative principles that protect the environment, benefit wildlife, create regionally closed nutrient cycles and more robust supply chains.\nThe five principles of regenerative agriculture are:\n- Do not disturb the soil.\n- Keep the soil surface covered.\n- Keep living roots in the soil.\n- Grow a diverse range of crops.\n- Bring grazing animals back to the land.\nThe Charter Co-op scheme will include large regional marketing boards (which could trade with each other), local food processing hubs and a nationwide chain of local shops. They could also run training schemes and insure members against crop failure.\nRegional marketing boards will coordinate with members to anticipate harvest yields and set pre-agreed minimum prices. They will act as buyers of last resort for perishable goods, working with local food processing hubs to turn food gluts into products with a longer shelf life. These products will be sold in the region’s Charter Co-op shops in the first instance, with any surplus being supplied to adjacent regions, and then further afield or to supermarkets. Supermarkets will be incentivised through the corporation tax system to stock a certain percentage of food from regional Charter Co-op sources. This percentage will initially be low, and will vary regionally and seasonally, but it will rise over time.\nCharter Co-op products from all regions will carry the same easily identifiable branding, helping consumers to support the Co-op initiative through their purchasing decisions. National advertising campaigns will promote Co-op products with a focus on easy, nutritious and seasonal recipes.\nA 2% tax will be introduced on non-Charter goods purchased from supermarkets. The revenue will support further development and maintenance of local food networks, and enable investment in critical infrastructure to improve food security and resilience. A country-wide network of abattoirs will be set up to reduce livestock transport time and make it easier for small farmers to sell meat locally. Grants will enable Co-ops to establish local shops and markets, to set up storage, processing and packaging facilities, and to provide services such doorstep milk delivery. Shared access to infrastructure and services will help farms to diversify and make them more economically resilient.\nTo facilitate their engagement with Charter Co-ops, farmers will receive practical support from a ‘Farmer Champion’ allocated to their region. Their role will include identifying marketing opportunities, providing business advice and freeing up farmers’ time through administrative support with grant and subsidy paperwork. This named person will make regular farm visits and be directly contactable via phone and e-mail to provide quick responses when required.\nChange should not be enforced in a top-down way and should not happen overnight. A clear long-term vision will allow for careful planning and slow, steady change with maximum buy-in. As more farmers sign the Charter, we will see a gradual return to a more patchwork-style landscape and resilient food economy, where each region has at least some of every category of food production and supply chains are shortened.\nImproving the national diet\nIt is not the role of the state to tell people what to eat. Nevertheless, the state has a responsibility to remove obstacles to healthy eating through economic and educational interventions. The main barriers to eating healthily are confusing messaging about what is and is not healthy, the cost of healthy food and not having enough time to cook healthy meals (11). Investment in overcoming these barriers will deliver long-term economic benefits to the UK as well as improving the lives of millions.\nThe OECD estimates that the combined cost of food-related disease, in lost workforce productivity, low educational outcomes and NHS funds, is 74 billion every year in the UK. This is equivalent to cutting the country’s GDP by 3.4%. To cover these costs, each person in the United Kingdom pays on average £409 in taxes per year.\nHenry Dimbleby and Jemima Lewis, Ravenous\nGood quality, nutrient-rich, local and seasonal food should never have become a luxury exclusively for the wealthy. The Charter Co-op scheme will give people greater choice and make healthy food universally available and affordable. We will prioritise establishment of Charter Co-op shops in the ‘food deserts’ and ‘food swamps’ where it is currently hard to find wholesome ingredients and where obesity is prevalent. Charter Co-ops will initially receive state subsidy to ensure prices of staple goods are no higher than in supermarkets. Additionally, recipients of benefits will receive a discount card for Charter Co-op shops and for purchasing Charter Co-op produce from supermarkets. These are worthwhile investments to strengthen local food production and ultimately reduce public spending on healthcare.\nWe will adopt the recommendation in the National Food Strategy to introduce a tax on sugar and salt sold to food producers, restaurants and caterers (19). This will incentivise companies to use less sugar and salt in their recipes, improving public health and generating significant revenue that can be invested in initiatives to help children develop healthy eating habits.\nWe will improve practical home economics education in schools and run pilot schemes in conjunction with the NHS to help parents develop skills in planning and preparing healthy, affordable, seasonal meals. Classes could be run from demonstration kitchens located in Charter shops or in school kitchens during weekends or holidays, choosing areas where obesity is particularly prevalent.\nEvery child and staff member will receive free school lunches made on the premises from local and seasonal ingredients. Information about the source of the food and how it was prepared will routinely be displayed. Fruit and water will be provided at break times and unhealthy snacks banned. This will establish healthy eating patterns to last for life; not just the nutrition, but the convivial ritual of sitting down together to enjoy good quality food cooked from scratch, presented well and with pride.\nDespite extensive public support, government proposals to restrict junk food advertisements have suffered many delays. We will ban all junk food advertisements on television and online at any time of day. We will also ban multibuy promotions on unhealthy products, which encourage people to overeat, or to overbuy and then throw away.\nPolicy Summary\n- Support the establishment of regional Charter Co-operatives, enabling farmers, food producers and retailers to work together to process and sell food locally at viable prices.\n- Provide infrastructure grants to improve local food resilience and sustainability.\n- Introduce a 2% tax on sales of non-Charter goods sold in supermarkets.\n- Review the Groceries Supply Code of Practice and ensure better monitoring and enforcement of compliance. Establish an independent regulatory body for supermarkets.\n- Through Charter Co-ops, subsidise the cost of healthy food for low income households.\n- Enable ‘Farmer Champions’ to facilitate collaboration through business advice and administrative support with grant and subsidy paperwork.\n- Initiate a tax on wholesale purchase of sugar and salt by food producers and caterers.\n- Provide free school lunches made on the premises from local, seasonal ingredients.\n- Improve practical home economics teaching in schools and provide education for adults in healthy, affordable meal planning and cooking.\n- Ban junk food advertising and retail promotions on unhealthy food products\nTARGET 2\nSUSTAINABLE\nFARMING AND\nENVIRONMENTAL\nRESTORATION\nOur natural environment provides vital goods and services, such as crop pollination, healthy soil, clean water and pest control, as well as the social and cultural benefits of access to nature. Environmental damage makes ecosystems less resilient, affecting their ability to deliver the services we need – including food production and drinking water.\nThree decades ago, the UK signed a global commitment to halt biodiversity loss, becoming the first country to produce a national action plan to conserve species and habitats. A raft of legislation and policies has been produced to protect our natural environment. Public sector spending on UK nature conservation has doubled in the past twenty years.\nDespite this, the UK is now described as one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world (20). We are seeing long-term declines in many species, including farmland birds, woodland birds and pollinating insects. Pressure from invasive species is increasing. Less than 10% of terrestrial habitats of conservation importance are in favourable condition and just over a third of freshwater habitats have good ecological status (21).\nModern agriculture has been a major cause of environmental decline in the UK, but this is largely because market pressures left farmers with no good options. For decades there has been a political and societal belief that the role of agriculture was only to produce ever-cheaper food for a growing population. At the same time, economic liberalism enabled the food processing and retail industries to become more oligopolistic and powerful. To gain the maximum yield from their land and to survive financially under these conditions, farmers were forced to specialise and intensify.\nThe transition from traditional mixed farming to specialise in either livestock or arable raised productivity but had a devastating impact on wildlife. Reduction in crop types and changes to cropping patterns have reduced habitat diversity.\nOver-use of chemical fertiliser has weakened soils and damaged freshwater habitats. Pesticides and weedkillers have caused declines in insect populations. Hedgerow removal has destroyed valuable bird nesting habitat and wildlife corridors. Increased stocking density has led to over-grazing, soil damage and pollution of watercourses.\nThere are social impacts too. Food produced rapidly by intensive methods is often less nutritious than that produced more slowly by traditional agriculture. The focus on efficiency has led to larger farms with fewer workers, causing the decline of once thriving rural communities.\nFarmers are well aware of the negative impacts of specialisation and intensification, and many are striving to combine food production with nature restoration. Not only is this better for the environment, it is often more profitable in the long term. Financial analysis of over 160 farms showed that reducing outputs to a level that can be supported by the farm’s natural resources improved commercial returns by up to 45% while benefiting nature (22).\nSHOWCASE\nFarming with nature – profitably\nDurie Farm, Fife has been following a regenerative system for over 20 years, featuring crop rotation, no ploughing or insecticide use, and using cover crops and compost to replenish nutrients. This has greatly reduced expensive chemical fertiliser and fuel inputs with no reduction in arable yields. Introduction of mob grazing for organic beef production has saved costs on animal feed and winter bedding, while enabling pastures to recover. Throughout the farm, wildlife is thriving and soil quality has greatly improved.\nNethergill Farm, Yorkshire Dales found that conventional beef and sheep farming was not profitable in the uplands. They reduced stocking density, introduced hardy breeds, and restored hay meadows and natural drainage. For over 10 years, this approach has enabled the farm to run at a profit by reducing expenditure on feed, fertiliser and veterinary bills. Surveys show that habitats are improving, and that otters, red squirrels and black grouse have all returned to the area.\nBwlchwernen Fawr, Ceredigion is Wales’ longest certified organic dairy farm. Hedgerows, field margins, woodland areas, hay meadows and watercourses are managed to benefit wildlife as well as the herd. Diverse plant mixtures in an arable crop rotation maintain soil fertility. The cows’ naturally varied diet and the presence of healthy bacteria communities in the soil ensure the production of high quality milk and cheese, demonstrating the commercial benefits of farming in harmony with nature for over 50 years.\nDougherty Farm, Derry established a conservation grazing pattern for native breeds of cattle and sheep. This protects habitats from both under- and over-grazing, improves the quality of pasture and removes the need for expensive supplemental feeding. Using hardy breeds and planting hedges to provide natural shelter enables stock to be wintered outdoors, again saving costs. This beneficial grazing regime and establishment of hedgerows has increased biodiversity on the farm.\nElston Farm, Devon is one of seven farms taking part in a 12-year silvopasture trial. Combining grazed pasture with woodland in the same field can increase the productivity of the land area while improving the welfare of the animals. It also creates habitat for wildlife and can increase drought resilience and reduce flooding. Time will tell, but farmer Andy Gray is confident that planting 5,600 trees on his 165-acre farm will prove profitable: “I’m a commercial farmer. This is a commercial enterprise and I will make it make money.”\nTolhurst Organic, Oxfordshire is one of the longest running stock-free organic vegetable producers in England, farming without chemical or animal input for over 30 years. Soil quality and crop health are improved by fertility-building crops and green manures grown as well-designed rotations, along with vegetable and woodchip compost from the farm’s waste. Profitability is further increased by selling directly to customers via on-farm sales and catering, local markets and a box scheme.\nSome would like to see a return to more traditional methods of farming throughout the entire sector, but unfortunately this approach couldn’t produce the amount of food that we need. Environmentally friendly traditional farming is estimated to produce between 5% to 45% lower yields depending on crop type (23,24).\nAt the other extreme, some environmentalists want to reclaim vast swathes of land from agriculture and even ban livestock farming altogether. This would simply increase our reliance on imported food while offshoring our ecological footprint to other countries and irreversibly impacting our own rural communities. Farmers and citizens in the Netherlands and Ireland have pushed back against these measures.\nWe proposed a balanced approach that combines centuries-old farming wisdom with investment in new sustainable technology.\nSHOWCASE\nHigh tech, high yield, low impact\nSmartkas, Harlow – this vertical farm aims to produce 500 tons of strawberries per year on 10% of the area that would be needed by traditional farming. The plants are grown hydroponically in water, solar panels provide heat and light, pollination is carried out by a bee colony, and no pesticides are required due to the enclosed conditions. The ability to grow fruit throughout the year reduces the demand for imports, thereby delivering both environmental and economic benefits.\nFischer Farms, Lichfield and Norwich grow salad and herbs year-round in a vertical hydroponic system using renewable energy. Grown in a bio-secure environment without herbicides or pesticides, crops do not need to be washed, which extends their shelf life and reduces food waste. Future expansion plans include the production of soft fruits, wheat, rice and soya.\nElemental, Devon have developed an innovative protein and fat recovery technique which reduces food waste and increases profit by recovering up to 15% more high-quality meat from butchered animals.\nBetter Origin, Cambridge have partnered with Morrisons supermarkets to integrate containerised insect farms into free-range chicken farms. Fruit and vegetable food waste from supermarkets is converted to protein by insect larvae, which are then fed to chickens. Replacing soy protein with insect protein in the chickens’ diet has health and environmental benefits. Nearly 90% of the UK’s soy imports are used for animal feed; cutting these imports reduces our contribution to deforestation and biodiversity loss overseas.\nMays Farm, Oxfordshire have increased arable yields by selecting crop varieties with high disease resistance, undersowing clover to boost fertility and suppress weeds, analysing data on multiple environmental variables, and are currently trialling precision planting to improve light capture and reduce competition pressure.\nAgricultural technology – encompassing biotechnology, smart farming, automation, remote sensing, and innovation in transportation and storage – is a growing industry which shows great promise for increasing food production while minimising environmental impact. However, most new techniques are still in the early stages of development. It is not yet clear which will be most beneficial, whether they will have any unforeseen impacts, and when they will be ready to roll out at scale.\nWe will support agri-tech research and development to ensure that the UK stays at the forefront of innovation and that we have the necessary knowledge to develop effective land use strategies. We will achieve this through direct government investment, tax relief schemes both for SMEs and large companies, and grants for farmers to engage in collaborative research with the private sector or academia.\nBecause learning and innovation take place in the field as much as in the laboratory, we will support farmer-led research into cultivation and husbandry practices. Subsidies and grants will be available for practical experimentation in areas such as Korean Natural Farming and Bokashi, swales, no dig and no till, John Letts Heritage grain, radial wood-chip mulch, herbal leys and seaweed supplements for livestock.\nSpace for farming and nature\nThe UK is one of the most densely populated territories in Europe. Population density has increased by over 15% since 2000 and is predicted to keep rising. There is intense conflict for space from competing land use types, which will only increase in future.\nOver 70% of our land area is dedicated to farming and this does not supply all the food we need. The majority of this is livestock pasture, partly because much of our land is not viable for arable farming. To support rural communities and reduce reliance on imports while conserving our countryside, we need to make smart decisions about land use.\nThe SDP advocates maintaining at least 90% of existing agricultural land with food production as its primary purpose. A small proportion of this would be used for high tech, high yield, low impact farming (e.g. vertical farms), while retaining the majority for lower yield, profitable, wildlife-friendly farming, which provides cultural and aesthetic benefits as well as food. As understanding of new technologies improves, the proportion of land dedicated to high yield farming may increase, provided this is justified by the environmental and economic benefits and is not detrimental to rural communities.\nFarmers will be supported financially to take 5-10% of farmland out of food production and dedicate it to nature restoration, such as planting broadleaf woodland and restoring peat bogs. Financial support will be maintained to cover ongoing monitoring and management, contingent on outcomes. Such activities will be subsidised only in areas of least productive farmland. Best and most versatile farmland will be protected from all other land use types.\nUltimately, decisions on land use must be made at a local level by farmers and landowners, with input from the community. Land use cannot be dictated by central Government, but guidance can be provided and subsidies targeted to enable food production in harmony with nature restoration. Crucially, trade policy will ensure farmers are protected, not penalised, for farming to high standards (see Target 4).\nReforming agricultural subsidies\nFor many decades, agricultural subsidy has had a huge influence on farming methods, productivity and the UK landscape. Post-war subsidies incentivised agricultural intensification and specialisation to increase yields and drive down food prices. As the impacts on nature became apparent, environmental stewardship schemes were introduced with the aim of improving soil and water quality, enhancing landscape character and restoring farmland wildlife. Post-Brexit, new schemes are being developed to deliver ‘public goods for public money’ although the details are still being worked out, and uncertainty and delays during the transition period are causing huge problems for farmers.\nDespite the best intentions, the agricultural subsidy system has created more problems than it has solved. Over the years, targets and goals have continually been changed in a top-down, prescriptive way. Excessive bureaucracy, particularly during the EU-era, meant farmers spent too much time form-filling and faced severe penalties for late or incorrect applications. Area-based subsidies rewarded wealthy landowners, many of whom do not produce food at all. The amount of money available for environmental stewardship has been far too low to enable farmers to make any real difference, particularly on the most intensive farms where change is most needed. Small-scale interventions such as setting aside field margins have been shown to have very little impact on species recovery. The emerging post-Brexit schemes are more ambitious, but are doomed to failure unless the root causes of damaging farming practices are also tackled through trade and economic policies.\nUltimately, the SDP aims to enable farmers to be financially secure without relying on subsidies. This can be achieved through changes to domestic market and trade policies, as outlined under Targets 1 and 4, but it will take time. The current situation is that almost all farms, regardless of size, make more money from subsidies than from agricultural produce, and nearly 40% of farmers in England rely on basic payment subsidies to remain solvent. Uncertainty and bureaucracy in the agricultural subsidy system have actually increased since Brexit, leading many farmers to consider retirement and deterring potential new entrants. It is therefore essential that agricultural subsidies provide a stable environment for as long as necessary to ensure that those actively involved in food production stay in the business and that they can hand it on to a new generation when they retire.\nRather than paying farmers not to farm, or only giving them enough to ‘tinker around the edges’ environmentally, we will provide subsidies at the required level to enable all farms to make the transition to ecological and financial sustainability. Direct subsidies will be maintained for as long as needed but will be capped at £150,000 per farmer and will only be available to those whose primary land use is food production. Subsidies will be based on land area, but the rate per hectare will reduce as the total number of hectares increases, favouring small and medium-sized farms.\nEnvironmental restoration subsidies will be targeted at the most intensive and polluting sectors to enable them to convert to better systems. Changes such as reducing stocking densities, switching from indoor to outdoor rearing, and cutting chemical usage are costly to implement but will bring the biggest environmental benefits and must therefore be prioritised.\nAs outlined under Target 1, farmers will receive support with application and reporting paperwork from a ‘Farmer Champion’, who will also carry out follow-up checks. This will remove barriers to uptake, reduce farmers’ administrative burden and ensure most effective use of the subsidy system.\nRegulation of harmful practices\nIn addition to supporting environmentally friendly farming through subsidies and better market conditions, we will strengthen regulation of harmful practices.\nAntibiotic overuse in livestock farming leads to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria which can spread to humans, an issue which is recognised as a global health threat (25). Agriculture accounts for 30% of antibiotic use in the UK, of which 75% is routine ‘preventative’ application of antibiotics, some of which are deemed critically important for use in humans. Routine application prevents illness from stress caused by intensive farming systems, such as overcrowding, confinement, early weaning and tail docking. In addition to welfare concerns, the practice of keeping large numbers of genetically similar animals in cramped conditions is conducive to the emergence of new viruses and has been identified as a ‘disease bridge’ between animal and human infections (26). We will ban routine use of antibiotics and support farmers to move away from intensive livestock farming practices that rely on antibiotics and present a high risk to human health.\nChemical fertilisers can pollute watercourses and weaken soils. Their manufacture requires large amounts of fossil fuels, which are a finite resource. They also present the problem of diminishing returns, although the impact on UK crop yields has so far been offset by improvements in seed quality and sowing/harvesting techniques. We will introduce a tariff on chemical fertilisers to begin three years after the availability of subsidies to aid transition to less intensive methods. The rate will initially be low but will increase in subsequent years.\nRiver pollution comes from many sources, including sewage, transport and industry, but agriculture remains one of the main factors. In spite of regulations on chemical and organic fertiliser application, and more recently financial support for better slurry storage, there remains a minority of farmers who breach the rules. Through better resourcing of regulatory bodies, we will ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of water pollution regulations.\nPolicy Summary\n- Maintain at least 90% of existing farmland with food production as its primary purpose.\n- Taking land completely out of food production for nature restoration will only be subsidised on least productive farmland.\n- Best and most versatile farmland will be protected under the planning system from all other land use types.\n- Support agricultural innovation through direct government investment, tax relief schemes for SMEs and large companies, and grants for farmers to pursue independent research or engage in collaboration with the private sector or academia.\n- Agricultural subsidies will be maintained for as long as necessary to ensure retention and recruitment in farming. They will be phased out when wider economic policies make sustainable farming financially viable.\n- Direct subsidies will be capped at £150,000 per farmer and will only be available to those whose primary land use is food production.\n- Environmental restoration subsidies will be targeted at the most intensive and polluting sectors.\n- Better resourcing of regulatory bodies will ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of water pollution regulations.\n- Ban routine use of antibiotics and support farmers to move away from intensive livestock farming practices that rely on antibiotics and present a high risk to human health.\n- Introduce a rising tariff on chemical fertilisers to begin three years after the start of subsidies for transition away from intensive methods.\nTARGET 3\nTHRIVING RURAL\nCOMMUNITIES AND\nA SMALL FARM FUTURE\n“What images define the British countryside in 2023? Closed pubs; a new estate of boxy, pricey houses; the packed waiting room at the one doctor’s surgery within 20 miles; farmers at kitchen tables reading trolling tweets by vegans and rewilders; polluted rivers; empty beer cans beside bus stops where the bus no longer stops; the red-brick cottage which working people once rented, but which has now been turned into an Airbnb; the Ocado van delivering supplies to the second-homers.”\nJohn Lewis-Stempel, UnHerd.com, June 2023\nJust as the collapse of coal mining had devastating consequences for pit villages, our rural communities have been decimated by mechanisation, the use of cheap migrant labour and the trend towards ever larger farms with fewer workers. Tourism brings money into the local economy in some areas, but the jobs created tend to be seasonal, and the rise in holiday lets and second homes makes housing unaffordable for local families. Thousands of houses are built in large developments on agricultural and greenbelt land every year by the private sector, yet there remains a severe shortage of suitable homes for local people (27). The ratio of average house price to average income is higher in rural than urban areas, with the exception of London (28).\nEven in affluent rural areas there are pockets of deprivation. Although overall levels of poverty and ill-health are slightly lower than in urban areas, their impacts are exacerbated in the countryside due to social and economic factors including poor access to services, sparse public transport, longer travelling distances, weak broadband and mobile phone coverage, and higher domestic fuel costs (29). A combination of geographic isolation, loss of local facilities, poor communications networks and the changing demographic structure lead to increased loneliness amongst rural residents with resulting impacts on health outcomes.\nContrary to popular perceptions, the countryside is not free from crime and anti-social behaviour. In the past ten years, crime rates have risen three times faster in rural towns and villages than in the rest of the country. In 2022, the cost of rural crime rose by 22% to nearly £50 million, largely due to organised and often international gangs stealing farm equipment and livestock (6). Fear of crime is leading to loss of confidence in rural communities, particularly amongst farmers, young people and families. A third of rural people believe that crime has a moderate or great impact on their lives, one in ten feel unsafe in their own homes after dark, and only two in ten have a good perception of the local police force’s ability to prevent and reduce crime (30).\nThe rural population is ageing, as wealthy retirees move to the countryside while young people are forced to move away due to high house prices and limited job opportunities. Over half of the farmers in England and Wales are over 55 years old, and nearly a third are over 65 (31). Many farmers are simply selling their land when they retire because their children do not want to take over the farm. At the same time, new entrants who are not from farming families find it hard to start a career in agriculture due to a shortage of suitable farm and smallholding tenancies. This is exacerbated by inflated land prices caused by hedge funds seeking to profit from commodity crops or carbon credits. The future for the countryside is bleak unless we can give a new generation the skills, access and most importantly the desire to get into farming and associated rural trades.\nOver the past 70 years, the total number of farms in the UK has decreased while the average farm size has increased. The rate of farm loss has accelerated in recent years and is steepest amongst small and medium-sized farms (12). If this trend continues, it has been predicted that British family farms could die out in the next 30 years – and with them the rural communities they support and the unique landscape they have created.\nWe propose a suite of policies to revitalise rural communities and bring working families back to the countryside through:\n- investment in infrastructure, affordable housing and rural policing\n- reform of countryside planning and land ownership legislation\n- revival of land-based education\n- support for the establishment of smaller-scale farming.\nInvesting in rural communities\nThe reinvigoration of rural communities will require significant investment to reverse decades of economic neglect, but it will have long term social and economic benefits. Target 1 outlines plans for investment in food and farming infrastructure, such as abattoirs, orchards, local shops and markets, and food storage, transport and processing facilities. This will create jobs and boost local economies, but investment in the wider rural infrastructure will be needed to fully realise the benefits.\nWe commit an additional £500 million to support rural bus routes to connect villages and hamlets to towns and cities. We will also provide grants for communities to develop other transport solutions, such as purchase of vehicles for shared use.\nWe will maintain investment in the rollout of gigabit broadband to rural households and businesses, ensuring there are no limits on access to information, education and economic opportunities.\nResources in front-line policing will be significantly increased, with a particular focus on tackling organised crime gangs that target the farming community. The SDP’s commitment to maintaining a high-quality public realm applies as much to our countryside as to our city centres; we will ensure police and local authorities have the necessary resources to prevent vandalism and anti-social behaviour. Fly-tippers will be subject to stricter penalties including seizure of vehicles, and fines will be applied to home and business owners whose waste is found in fly-tipped locations.\nMost importantly, we will invest in housing. We will commit £2 billion annually via the newly established British Housing Corporation to construct new social housing for rural workers in consultation with local communities.\nRural homes\nPolling of residents in rural constituencies shows that over 40% would support more homes being built in their area and believe that reform of the planning system would help to stimulate growth in rural economies32. Sadly, where development does occur, it is often out of keeping with the landscape and does nothing to fulfil local needs. Consequently, over 600 grassroots campaigns have been set up across the UK by communities aiming to protect their green space from development.\nTo address the need for suitable, affordable housing in rural areas while preserving the essence of the countryside, we propose that the state once again takes an active role in house building. Newly created County Housing Corporations (CHCs) will assess housing need in rural areas and plan and build new housing developments to address that need. CHCs will have powers to make Compulsory Purchase Orders to acquire land and the ability to grant Planning Permission for new schemes. They will also be mandated to set up skills colleges to rapidly scale a local construction workforce. A priority will be the creation of affordable rent-to-buy and rental homes for land workers and their families. New build houses will include features to minimise environmental impact such as compost toilets with integrated humanure collection.\nThe British countryside is a national asset, but there are currently no limitations on foreign individuals or offshore trusts owning UK land. The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 requires overseas entities acquiring UK land to disclose their beneficial owners, but rules do not apply to foreign individuals and they set no restrictions on foreign ownership. Foreign interests feature prominently in the top 50 UK landowners, accounting for well over half a million acres. We will prohibit the sale of food- producing land to non-UK citizens or entities.\nWe will provide 50% match funding for local community groups wishing to buy land for sustainable community-run food production initiatives similar to those showcased below.\nCultivating knowledge – empowering a new generation of rural workers\nIn an increasingly urbanised population, it is a matter of urgency to restore connections between people, food production and the countryside. Numerous surveys have highlighted an alarming lack of knowledge amongst British children about where food comes from and how it is produced. Examples include high proportions of primary school children not knowing that eggs come from chickens, that milk comes from cows, thinking that tomatoes grow underground and that pasta is made from animals. The British Nutrition Foundation found that over 80% of primary school children would like to visit a farm to find out more about where their food comes from.\nFood and farming will be included on the school curriculum from early years to key stage 3 and will include practical activities and farm visits.\nSHOWCASE\nFarming for the community by the community\nFordhall Farm, Shropshire became England’s first community-owned farm following a successful campaign in 2006. It is fully organic and rears cattle, sheep and pigs in an outdoor extensive grazing system. Community ownership has given the tenant farmers the security to plan and diversify, with new ventures providing leisure, volunteering and education opportunities as well as fresh, healthy food.\nGreenmeadow Farm, Cwmbran was bought by the local community in the 1980s to protect it from development and preserve 250 years of farming history. It has thrived thanks to investment by the Council, which it repays by attracting visitors to the region, conserving the landscape and providing local people with a hub for events, activities and education.\nLauriston Agroecology Farm, Edinburgh was being used for intermittent grazing and silage production but was transformed by a workers’ co-operative in 2021 to a large-scale food growing farm using organic regenerative and agroecological practices. The farm includes a community orchard and allotments to give city residents the chance to get involved in food production, and offers education opportunities by working with local schools and youth groups. Produce is sold through a veg box scheme, with a discounted pricing model to make it affordable for all.\nJubilee Farm, Co. Antrim is Northern Ireland’s first community-owned farm. They rear free-range, high welfare pigs, grow organic vegetables sold through a veg box scheme, and offer curriculum-based lessons on food, farming and the environment.\nLand-based colleges were set up to provide the skills and knowledge needed by rural economies, working in partnership with farms and other rural businesses to give students hands-on experience. Over the past four decades, nearly 80% of land-based colleges have closed, largely due to high running costs and high- value assets which made them attractive targets for liquidation. The decline of this once influential, highly successful, world-leading education and technical skills sector since 1997 has been nothing short of a travesty.\nWe pledge to re-establish the significance, role and prominence of land-based colleges. We will return to the land-based college sector the power to devise and validate their own land-orientated qualifications, on the understanding that agriculture degrees must provide a solid grounding in regenerative practices and soil science.\nWithin each land-based college will be a bank-sponsored Countryside Business Centre to help focus investment and rural business innovation at a regional level. This could include business initiatives to deliver services in areas where people are dispersed, bringing social as well as economic benefits.\nApprenticeships in fields such as farming, forestry, horticulture and soil health will be increased through partnerships between land-based colleges, the wider education sector and rural businesses. We will set up a mentoring scheme for new entrants to receive advice and encouragement from experienced farmers during the first five years of their career.\nCreating routes into farming and restoring diversity of farm size\nFamily farmers form the backbone of our rural communities. To me, it is essential the contribution of the small-scale family farmer is properly recognised – they must be a key part in any fair, inclusive, equitable and just transition to a sustainable future. To do this, we must ensure that Britain’s family farmers have the tools and the confidence to meet the rapid transition to regenerative farming systems that our planet demands. Creating routes into farming and restoring diversity of farm size.\nCharles, Prince of Wales, The Guardian, May 2021\nGiving people the skills and knowledge to get into farming is not enough; new entrants need routes into farming through affordable agricultural tenancies or land ownership.\nWhere once the British countryside was a patchwork of farms of different sizes, the relentless pressure for increased yields and cheaper food has tipped the balance towards ever larger farms. Livestock farmers in particular have been forced to adopt industrial-scale methods to compete with imports from countries where these practices are widely used. The UK has nearly 800 CAFOs – concentrated animal feeding operations – in which thousands of animals live crammed together in barns, fed by automated machinery.\nIt is not always the case that large-scale farming is bad for animal welfare and for the environment, nor that small-scale farming is inefficient or irrelevant to overall food production. Both large and small farms can be productive and environmentally sustainable if good practices are followed. However, diversity of farm size must be restored and maintained to improve resilience in food production, regional economies and rural communities (12).\nWe propose the following measures to restore diversity of farm size across the UK and facilitate entry into farming for a new generation.\nWe will divert 1% of all inheritance tax (£50-£70 million per year) to a land acquisition scheme for ten years. This will be used to buy green belt land for market gardens and orchard villages, as well as to buy large, specialised, nature-depleted farms to split into smaller farms and smallholdings, sharing some infrastructure.\nCounty farms are an important national resource, covering 200,000 acres in England alone. Owned by local authorities and rented to tenant farmers at reasonable rates, they are a key lever for helping new entrants into farming. They provide environmental and social as well as economic benefits, but their area has declined by 50% in the past four decades as councils have sold off land (33). We will prohibit further sale of county farms by local authorities and provide land from the above scheme to expand their county farm holdings, with a focus on increasing the availability of small starter units.\nTo encourage those selling large farms with more than one house to break up the farm into smaller units capable of supporting more farming families, we will donate a portion of the stamp duty received from the sale to the seller. We will research ways of incentivising retiring farmers with no succession to gift their land to the nation as county farms.\nWhere a large area of farmland contains only one house, we will relax planning rules to enable more houses to be built on the land under a covenant that the land will be farmed regeneratively by the people living in those dwellings. Any farm over 500 acres wishing to acquire neighbouring land will have to apply for special permission, which will only be granted if there are demonstrable benefits for the environment, local economy and community.\nPolicy Summary\n- We will invest in rural infrastructure, particularly communications, transport and housing.\n- Resources in front-line policing will be significantly increased, with a particular focus on tackling organised crime gangs that target the farming community.\n- Food and farming will be on the school curriculum from early years to key stage 3 and will include practical activities and farm visits.\n- We will re-establish the significance, role and prominence of land-based colleges, and invest in apprenticeships and mentoring schemes to facilitate access to rural careers.\n- Within each land-based college will be a bank-sponsored Countryside Business Centre to help focus investment and rural business innovation at a regional level.\n- We will prohibit the sale of food-producing land to non-UK citizens or entities.\n- We will provide 50% match funding for local community groups wishing to buy land for sustainable community-run food production initiatives.\n- We will divert 1% of all inheritance tax to a land acquisition scheme to establish market gardens, orchard villages, small farms and smallholdings.\n- We will prohibit the sale of county farms by local authorities.\n- Through tax incentives and planning reform, we will reverse the decline in small farms and restore diversity of farm size across the UK.\nTARGET 4\nFOOD SECURITY\nIN A GLOBAL\nMARKET\nIt’s probably unwise to assume that current patterns of peaceful worldwide seaborne trade, built on large and vulnerable containerised vessels, will last long into the future.\nChris Smaje, The Land, Issue 33\nFood security is achieved when all people, all of the time, have access to sufficient, affordable, safe, nutritious, sustainably produced food. Food security is under threat at a global level and in the UK due to unsustainable production methods and resulting environmental decline, complex supply chains, pest and disease outbreaks, extreme weather events, rising energy and input costs, population growth, availability and cost of labour, competing demands for land and water use, and socio-economic inequalities (34).\nAchieving food security does not mean becoming fully self-sufficient. International trade enables countries to diversify their national diet and minimise risks from unpredictable growing seasons and poor harvests. Nevertheless, UK self-sufficiency has declined considerably since the 1980s-1990s (35), and we now import more than we export for all food categories except beverages (36). Although the UK produces around three quarters of the indigenous food we eat, the proportion varies greatly between food categories. We are largely self-sufficient in grains, meat, eggs and dairy products, but heavily reliant on imports of fresh vegetables and fruit (37).\nThe policies outlined under Targets 1-3 will all go some way to improving UK food security.\nInvesting in local food and farming infrastructure, reducing regional specialisation, creating new orchards and market gardens and adopting technology to extend growing seasons will help to shorten supply chains while increasing and diversifying production of indigenous food types.\nSupporting innovative and sustainable farming methods will reduce threats to food security from environmental decline and from rising costs of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides.\nTraining a new generation of land workers and providing affordable rural housing, while investing in automation where appropriate, will mitigate risks due to labour shortage.\nEstablishment of Charter Co-ops and regional marketing boards combined with education programmes will cut waste and reduce the impact of socio-economic inequality on food security. Retaining existing farmland for food production, preventing sale of agricultural land to foreign buyers, and restoring diversity of farm size across the UK will increase resilience to conflicting demands for land use.\nBut more is needed to ensure UK food security in an increasingly unsettled global economy.\nTo achieve this, we propose:\n- Trade policy that protects British farmers and minimises our global impacts.\n- A ‘Buy British’ public sector procurement policy.\n- Clear labelling to empower consumer choice.\n- Regular assessment of food security.\nTrade policy\nThere is little point investing in making UK agriculture more environmentally sustainable if its economic viability is undermined by cheap imports from countries with lower environmental and animal welfare standards. Furthermore, the UK’s consumption of food produced overseas has devastating environmental impacts in the producer countries which are only just starting to be monitored (38).\nThere is considerable public support for trade policy which would protect British farmers while giving us greater control over the impacts of our consumption. A survey commissioned by the National Farmers’ Union found that 85% of respondents would like future trade deals to protect UK farmers from being undercut by cheaper, sub-standard food imports (39).\nWe pledge to veto any trade deals that would harm British food producers, and to prohibit imports of food and drink not produced to our environmental and animal welfare standards. The production of soy and palm oil has particularly severe impacts in producer countries, including deforestation, biodiversity loss, water use, soil degradation and the opportunity cost of growing food for domestic consumption. Nearly 90% of the UK’s soy imports are for animal fodder, mostly for industrial pig and poultry production.\nA rising tariff will be applied to soy imports and the revenue used to fund research into environmentally sustainable substitutes. We will also ban imports of meat from countries where animals have been primarily raised on soy. We will maintain the UK’s commitment to achieving the target of sourcing 100% of palm oil from RSPO-certified sustainable suppliers. This requires a particular focus on reducing palm-derived ingredients in animal feed as part of the transition to regenerative and extensive farming methods outlined under Target 2.\nA 10% tariff will be applied to imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. Revenue will contribute to the re-establishment and maintenance of UK orchards and development of the fruit and vegetable agri- tech sector. Regional marketing boards will process perishable goods to extend their shelf-life. Charter Co-ops will encourage consumption of preserved (e.g. frozen, dried, tinned) fruit and vegetables. Education programmes will raise awareness of the nutritional value of preserved goods, which is often higher than that of fresh goods (40). Together, these measures will increase year-round availability and consumption of home-grown produce, cutting waste and reducing reliance on imports.\nBuy British in public sector procurement\nThe public sector spends over £2.4 billion per year providing meals in schools, hospitals, prisons, the military, care homes and other institutions. Previous governments have pledged to increase sourcing from British suppliers (41), but have yet to deliver on that promise.\nWe will establish a ‘Buy British’ food and drink procurement policy within the public sector. Each department and local authority will report annually on the proportion of total food and drink procurement sourced from British suppliers and from local suppliers.\nPublic procurement will seek to increase consumption of sustainably sourced British fish, particularly in schools. Fish consumption has been declining for years and we now eat less than half the amount recommended by the Government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. This will be an increasingly important source of protein as meat yields from sustainable extensive farming methods will be lower than those from current unsustainable intensive systems.\nEmpowering consumer choice through clearer food labelling\nMany consumers are keen to support British food producers and high animal welfare standards through their purchasing decisions, but current food labelling protocols make this difficult.\nThe aforementioned NFU survey found that 84% of respondents supported clearer labelling of British food and 73% said they look specifically for British food when they go shopping (39). More recently, a proposal for supermarkets to add a ‘Buy British’ button or filter to their online ordering systems rapidly gained over 21,000 signatures (42). Research conducted for British Lion Eggs found that over half of shoppers would be prepared to pay more for food made from British ingredients, while seven in ten believe food should not be imported if it can be produced in the UK (43) .\nUnder the Food Information to Consumers regulations, country of origin must be stated on unprocessed, packaged meat and fish. Unprocessed meat must be labelled to show the country or countries where the animal was born, reared, slaughtered and butchered. Marketing standards require origin labelling on unprocessed fruit, vegetables, eggs and dairy products. However, there is currently no requirement to provide origin information on processed foods unless the product name, description or other labelling suggests it is from a certain country. There is no requirement to list the origin of key ingredients if the origin of the processed product is not stated.\nWe will enforce clear and prominent country of origin labelling on both raw and processed foods and their ingredients. Charter Co-ops will run marketing campaigns to promote British food and drink, with a focus on locally grown seasonal produce. A ‘Buy British’ filter will be mandatory for all online food retail systems. Although most UK farm animals are reared using intensive farming methods, there is currently no law requiring food labels to state how an animal has been raised, with the exception of whole hens’ eggs. UK consumption of eggs produced under ‘cage-free’ conditions doubled after the introduction of mandatory labelling in 2004, which is often held up as a consumer-driven animal welfare success story. But these regulations apply only to whole eggs; one third of the eggs used in food manufacturing come from abroad, and the rearing conditions are not listed on the processed output. Between 2021-23, the UK saw a 2,000% increase in egg imports from Poland produced under low welfare conditions.\nWe will introduce mandatory animal welfare labelling for raw and processed animal-derived products sold directly to consumers. The first priority will be to develop and test standard protocols for labelling poultry and pork, working with producers and consumers to define a system that captures and clearly communicates the nuance within different production methods. Protocols will then be established for other meats and derived products. The labelling protocols will also apply to imports, creating a level playing field for British farmers.\nIn the longer term, we will expand country of origin and animal welfare labelling to food sold in catering environments.\nMonitoring progress\nTo monitor progress in this critically important and rapidly changing area, we will maintain the current commitment to an annual Food Security Summit and will increase the frequency of Food Security Assessments to at least once every two years.\nPolicy Summary\n- Veto trade deals that would harm British food producers.\n- Prohibit imports of food and drink not produced to the UK’s environmental and animal welfare standards\n- Rising tariff on soy imports and the revenue used to fund research into environmentally sustainable substitutes.\n- 10% import tariff on fresh fruit and vegetables.\n- Establish a ‘Buy British’ food and drink procurement policy within the public sector.\n- Enforce clear country of origin labelling on both raw and processed foods.\n- Mandatory ‘Buy British’ filter for all online food retail systems.\n- Mandatory animal welfare labelling for raw and processed animal-derived products.\n- In the longer term, we will expand country of origin and animal welfare labelling to food sold in catering environments.\n- Hold an annual Food Security Summit and produce biennial Food Security Assessments.\nA DEMOCRATIC VOICE\nFOR THE COUNTRYSIDE\nOver a third of UK parliamentary constituencies are defined as largely, mainly or significantly rural, but Westminster is dominated by urban voices and priorities. The countryside has no champion and no leader. It was ravaged by New Labour policies, which in 2002 gave rise to the largest rural protest the UK has ever seen. It has been taken for granted and badly let down by the Conservative Party, with years of economic neglect now compounded by the phasing out of agricultural subsidies, harmful trade deals and the likely impacts of net zero legislation.\n12 million voters live in rural areas, but they increasingly feel unrepresented by the main parties. Just over a third agreed that Conservatives, Labour or Liberal Democrats understand and respect rural communities and the rural way of life (32). While a political divide between urban and rural areas is not a new phenomenon, there is evidence of growing polarisation on political, socio-economic and cultural issues, and of disenchantment and distrust in democracy increasing along a gradient from city to countryside (44).\nThe policies outlined above aim to re-invigorate the countryside, its people and their way of life. To ensure their successful implementation and re-set the balance between rural and urban voices in Parliament, we propose a further two measures.\nWe will establish a royal commission into conserving the British countryside. The commission would be tasked with defining the countryside’s true culture, values and identity, and making a suite of recommendations to be accounted for in all policy areas relevant to the countryside, including by devolved administrations. We will set up a dedicated Countryside Policy Committee in Parliament, whose chair and members will be drawn exclusively from MPs representing rural constituencies. This will go some way to addressing the urban bias in matters concerning the countryside.\nCONCLUSION\nThere is broad consensus about the increasingly severe environmental, social and health problems arising from our food system – so why have they not been addressed?\nThere are two reasons why attempts to change the UK’s broken food system have never seriously been implemented.\nFirstly, governments have been too scared to challenge the narrative that all people want is cheap food and that they will not tolerate a ‘nanny state’ telling them what to eat. This narrative is simply not true. Research shows that citizens now want visible political leadership in this area and that there is strong public support for the bold interventions we propose in this paper (45).\nSecondly, other parties are fettered by neoliberal economic policies which prevent any meaningful attempt to tackle this issue. Free trade and open labour markets have deterred investment in training and innovation, increased our reliance on over-extended global supply chains, forced food producers to prioritise yield over sustainability, and sold swathes of our countryside into foreign ownership.\nThe SDP advocates a social market economy based on the beneficial coexistence of pro-public sector and pro-market policies. We are free from vested interests and not afraid to take radical action where necessary to ensure the health, prosperity and security of British people. This includes curbing the power of supermarkets and protecting our food producers from unfavourable trade deals.\nWe will also ensure that actions to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels are never allowed to undermine the UK’s energy security and food security.\nThe proposals outlined here will initially require substantial public investment. We are honest about that. But over time, reliance on state support will diminish and rural economies will thrive independently in the hands of their local communities.\nInvestment in technology and farmer-led research will increase productivity without sacrificing sustainability, ultimately removing dependence on subsidies. Initiatives to encourage and enable healthy eating will reduce healthcare costs in the long term. Once fully established, Charter Co-ops, regional marketing boards and associated local food infrastructure will create wealth, especially as they will be further supported by Land-based Colleges providing a skilled workforce and Countryside Business Centres investing in rural business innovation. Adopting this bold, holistic approach now will deliver our vision for the countryside within 10-15 years.\nThe British landscape will once again be a patchwork of different-sized farms, interspersed with clean rivers and hedgerows buzzing with life. Farmers will be respected as they should be, both for putting food on our tables and for restoring the environment. They will be able to plan for the future, with a new generation ready and willing to take the reins when they retire. Villages and market towns will once again be home to thriving multi-generational communities, with housing, jobs and services to support them. ‘Food deserts’ will become ‘food oases’, where people can afford to buy healthy, locally-produced ingredients and know how to prepare nutritious meals for their families. The countryside will be a living, working landscape for all to enjoy.\nCan we afford to do it? We can’t afford not to.\nYou have to grapple with trade policies to protect farmers from being undercut on price by worse farming systems; you have to regulate poor practices to raise their cost; you have to curb the cartel-like power of supermarkets; and even do the unthinkable, and make food more expensive to reflect its true cost (and make sure to help the poorest in our society by redistributing wealth so they can afford it).\nFARMS, FIELDS & FOOD 29 -James Rebanks, UnHerd.com, December 2020\nREFERENCES\n- Sustainable Food Trust.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_trans-rights-a-triumph-of-mind-over-matter/content_108.html": "As activists campaign to cancel Britain’s best-loved children’s author for saying that biological sex exists, transgender rights has become one of today’s most toxic cultural flashpoints. Even most cautious approach to the topic feels like walking on eggshells.\nMy own journey on this fraught topic has taken me some distance from a social life in the 2000s that for a while revolved around the (then embryonic) London female-to-male trans ‘scene’. There, I explored my own gender identity and presentation, while evangelising queer theory to all and sundry.\nBut as time went on I felt a growing disquiet at the direction the movement was taking.\nBack then, transgender identities felt like a progressive challenge to restrictive sex roles. But as such identities have become more mainstream, and normative sex roles ever less relevant to how we work and live our lives in the modern world, it has increasingly felt to me like the cutting edge of the movement is morphing into something more hubristic than liberatory: a radical assertion of the primacy of mind over matter.\nHumans are a sexually dimorphic species. Sex roles (commonly referred to as ‘gender’) can’t be wholly separated from biological sex. In asserting that sex roles have no relationship to sex, but are in fact free-floating identities, the trans movement in effect declares that sex is unimportant. Some even question its objective existence. Thus severed from any material grounding, the social roles ‘man’ or ‘woman’ become costumes or attitudes, no more objectively definable than (say) ‘goth’.\nThis can feel liberating to those who find the social norms associated with the sexes uncomfortable. But for us females in particular, biological sex is far from a trivial detail.\nI still remember the first time my brother defeated me in an arm wrestle, when I was ten years old and he was twelve. I was furious that something as unasked-for as a biological difference between us had now permanently rendered us unequal in a playfight, where previously we’d been evenly matched.\nOn a more serious note, crime and violence are sexed: in the United States males commit 96 per cent of all murders, 99 per cent of sex crimes and 100 per cent of rapes (because you need a penis to rape). Meanwhile females are less physically strong, and our anatomy and reproductive capacity makes us vulnerable to assault, rape and the many risks associated with pregnancy.\nInner identity does nothing to mitigate the threats women face due to being female. It’s physiological femaleness that marks girls out for genital mutilation (FGM); physiological femaleness that gets women kidnapped for bride trafficking into China; physiological femaleness that got 14-year-old Rose Kalemba raped at knifepoint to create a porn video monetised by PornHub for years while she was still at school.\nEven if we pretend it isn’t there, or is subordinate to our identities, the sexed nature of our bodies continues to exist and shape women’s lives. So a movement that asserts the absolute primacy of mind over matter, identity over biological sex, is bound to feel jarring to women – because experience tells us it’s not true. And claiming it is disadvantages us at a fundamental level. After all, if we’re all just free-floating minds, then women no longer have any basis for talking about the ways our bodies make us vulnerable.\nOf course, this doesn’t mean that we’re nothing but the sum of our biology. Humans are thinking, feeling, social and visionary creatures as much as we are evolved animals. All these aspects of us exist in tension.\nAcknowledging the role of our bodies in shaping who and what we are as humans isn’t to reduce humans to the status of mere flesh. Nor is it a claim, as some activists suggest, that male and female humans alike should stuff our personalities into narrow masculine or feminine boxes to match our physiology.\nRather, it’s a recognition that the human condition is a mess of competing urges, aims and longings, and sometimes we can’t have what we want. Sometimes the world outside us refuses to be reshaped according to our innermost desires. That this is true is more distressing for some than others, but it’s still true.\nFor that subset of people who feel their identity to be at odds with their physiology, that tension between inner and embodied reality is painfully acute. We should meet this obvious distress with compassion and courtesy, not stigma or discrimination.\nWe should shield transgender people from unjust treatment.\nBut that doesn’t mean we must accept the idea that bodies don’t matter.\nSince entering the trans debate/issue online, I have become increasingly aware of the older transexual community (usually MtF) who are disillusioned with the current transgender community and are finding themselves ostracised. Frequently, in some cases of more prominant voices such as Debbie Hayton, who disagree with the mantra that trans women are women, they find themselves on the receiving end of nasty threatening behaviour from rights activists. They have lived many years as transexuals, just wanting to get on with their lives and now they are being exposed and thrust into the spotlight. It’s unjustified and frankly not fair! They are allies of women in the fight to retain sex segregated spaces, sports, care facilities and for the truthful reporting of crime and statistics. We need to support them all we can.\nThank you for being the only political party that has a decent policy on transgender and sex based rights of women. It’s thorough, well written and says very clearly what I would like to hear my own Party saying.\nI can’t join the SDP for many reasons, but I just wanted to give that policy a huge thumbs up!\nPersonal choice is a Person’s right no one has a right to decide for another Human being\nThis is a complex issue, firstly because “wokists” conflate many different issues to create an illusory coalition. The acronym “LGBT+” gives that away very clearly if you stop to think about it. Each of those initials, and the others represented by the plus sign refers to a different set of people, each of which is in turn made up of many individuals with different concerns, issues, or problems. It’s a bit like lumping together people with heart disease, ‘flu, unemployment or loneliness into a single category and prescribing a single remedy – say tolerance and understanding – for them all.\nBesides offering a modicum of comfort, tolerance and understanding is no real answer to most problems. People need real answers for their real problems.\nGender dysphoria will have many causes, from mis-assignment of surgery to “correct” an inter-sex baby, to responses to emotional or sexual abuse. Forceful gender stereotyping by close relatives could be one form of abuse. Asking a child too young to understand the significance of sex which they want to choose could be another. We need experts who genuinely understand the issue from medical and psychological perspectives to look after those experiencing it and identify the actual root of the problem. Proper treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis. Each case is an individual person responding to their situation in an individual way and no one benefits by becoming a political football. That too is a form of abuse.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_watch-out-for-deepfakes-the-newest-threat-to-democracy/content_11.html": "Monday 21st July 1969 was a hot day in Washington D.C. The temperature peaked at 35ºC that afternoon and thunderstorms were on the way. In the cool of the Oval Office, President Nixon was reading a pre-prepared script into a live broadcast TV camera for the Six O’Clock News. It was a message that no-one wanted to hear:\n“Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery.”\nExcept that he didn’t make the speech, the Apollo 11 mission was a success, the astronauts returned safely and the ‘Contingency Speech’ as it was known was never used. But if you want to see Nixon making the speech that never was, have a look at a recent experiment by researchers from the Center for Advanced Virtuality at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). https://moondisaster.org\nThis is a good example of a new phenomenon set to hit your social media accounts soon – Deepfakes. This one was an experiment by legitimate researchers at a prestigious university, but many are less benign.\nSo, what are ‘Deepfakes’? And why should people who care about democracy be worried?\nIn simple terms, Deepfake technology enables anyone with a computer and Internet connection to create realistic-looking photos and videos of people saying and doing things that they did not actually say or do. Based on the pre-existing phrase ‘deep learning’, deepfakes first emerged on the internet in late 2017, powered by an innovative new deep learning method known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). A GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look authentic to human observers.\nHave a look at the faces below – all reasonable enough? None of them is real.\nUnsurprisingly, as with many tech initiatives, Deepfakes were initially seized upon by the always inventive and resourceful online porn industry. But they have come a long way since transposing A-list actors heads onto pornstars bodies.\nA recent example from the US that attracted media attention. During the ad break in ESPN’s popular documentary series ‘The Last Dance’, in April this year State Farm Insurance debuted a TV commercial that appeared to show footage from 1998 of ESPN analyst Kenny Mayne making startlingly accurate predictions about the year 2020. It would have caused a major ‘water cooler moment’ had the country not been in lockdown, but it was a Deepfake designed to get the viewer’s attention and it worked. The commercial startled, amused and fascinated ESPN’s viewers. What viewers should have felt, though, was worried.\nThe New York Times took the view that the ESPN commercial ‘Hints at Advertising’s Deepfake Future’ and that with the pandemic shutting down production, companies would increasingly ask ad agencies to make up digitally altered footage.\nBut it goes further than just untrustworthy TV advertising. Recently deepfakes have given us President Obama apparently using an expletive to describe President Trump and Mark Zuckerberg ‘admitting’ that Facebook’s true goal is to manipulate and exploit its users.\nBut, many argue, Deepfakes are really only an internet novelty. Not so, unfortunately. They are rapidly becoming a weapon of choice for destructive social and political forces. The rise in Deepfakes presence on the internet is rapid. At the start of 2019 it was estimated that 7,964 deepfakes were online (of which most were pornography) but, by December that year, the number had almost doubled.\nSo, starting from the darkest corners of the internet, Deepfake technology is starting to make its presence felt in the mainstream. The harm that could be done to political debate and democratic processes if entire populations can be shown fake videos that they believe are real is obvious.\nAs with most ‘fake news’, timing is key. Releasing a damaging Deepfake video 48 hours before an election might be perfect in terms of sowing seeds of doubt and preventing the truth to emerge completely. The Deepfake could be a major social and political weapon of our age, weaponizing information in a way that takes full advantage of the dynamics of the social media ecosystem that prizes ‘traffic’ above everything.\nIn a recent report, Washington’s Brookings Institution summed up the range of political and social dangers that deepfakes pose as: ‘distorting democratic discourse; manipulating elections; eroding trust in institutions; weakening journalism; exacerbating social divisions; undermining public safety; and inflicting hard-to-repair damage on the reputation of prominent individuals, including elected officials and candidates for office.’\nContributing technical editor: Chhavi Chauhan, PhD, Ethical Artificial Intelligence Policy Expert.\nimagine the fake Democrats reaction in November when Trump gets re-elected President I cannot see Biden winning\nThis is very worrying, as it undermines not only democracy but justice and every academic discipline. People already talk about a “post-truth” society, but if it becomes impossible for people to know what is and isn’t true because evidence can easily be fabricated everyone becomes a potential victim of irrefutable misinformation and defamation.\nStrong laws are needed, but how could cases be proven? How could such laws be compatible with free speech? Who would decide what is and isn’t true for enforcement purposes? It’s hard to see how knowledge could survive.\nOur whole society depends on being able to examine evidence and much of what is currently wrong can be traced to a failure to do so properly, but how can we rectify that if reliable evidence is simply not available?\nwhy does anyone still listen to lame duck Obama who was one of the worst American presidents of all time He made Theresa May and Bojo look like political giants, I hold no candle for Trump either and I would worry about Biden as President\nI am now at the point of only believing what I can see and hear with my own eyes and ears in the real world.\nSadly, this “deepfake” phenomenon is the last straw in media for me. We can no longer believe newspapers, magazines, radio, tv or internet. Looking at the silver lining, as one always should – glass half-full and all that, we should only rely on media for fiction, reality is for living our lives in the real world. If we adopt this ideology then it can only be good for our planet as there will be minimal requirement and less reliance on technology for our political and daily news plus we can no longer rely on it for reliable statistics and reference.\nI am sorry if this is a little wordy but your comments box will not allow me to review my message, but thank you for giving me the facility to privately comment.\nI’ve enjoyed your website, and … if I can believe all that I’ve read about your policies then you may well have another supporter.\nI am not one to rush into decisions; I like to ponder and take my time before committing to a new political party and your views align very well with my own.\nYou can thank whomever decided on the leaflet letterbox drop for bringing your party to my attention at the last election. Obviously, we wouldn’t be having the fiasco with the Covert-19 virus policies, brought about by the current knee-jerk government of Boris Johnson and cabinet, if maybe few like me voted SDP.\nP.S. you may wish to have a look at your GDPR message, visitors to your site need to be automatically opted out of cookies except the functional ones.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2025_03_27_david-bettney-announced-as-sdp-candidate-for-doncaster-mayor/content_151.html": "The Social Democratic Party has announced David Bettney as the party’s candidate for Doncaster Mayor.\nDavid served in the Army for 22 years, completing tours in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and rising to the rank of Regimental Sergeant Major. Since leaving the Army, David has built and run several construction, logistics and storage businesses, and is now manager of a group of five companies employing over 350 people in the Middle East.\nBorn in Mexborough, David’s campaign priorities are to champion British and Yorkshire industry, to provide better opportunities for young people, to work rapidly to end homelessness, and to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour.\nDave sets out his message to voters below.\nAn all action Mayor: Things I will do in my first 100 days:\n- Assemble an audit task force to assess the true extent of Doncaster Council’s Debt, then make cuts, distribute to the neediest, and start paying the debt back!\n- Visit every primary and secondary school and hear the concerns of parents about Doncaster Council’s performance…I’ll get ground-truth!\n- Set up a voluntary pensioner check-in service where we as communities help to look after those who are most lonely and vulnerable. ANY pensioner that wants me to visit, to hear their concerns, I’ll meet at the local town hall. If they are disabled, I’m happy to visit their homes…I care because you matter.\n- Meet with businesses, for them to give their concerns, and for me to help them tailor bespoke solutions for their growth. It’s in all our interests to get Doncaster businesses thriving…The velocity of the “local” pound! Re-industrialise Doncaster, to make real things and create real jobs again.\nMy Policies on the Things That Matter Most\nCrime\nTo address anti-social behaviour, I will give talks at schools and sports clubs, to ensure that the teenagers are told that they are worth something, that they can go on to achieve great things, but how their behaviour can directly affect their community (as they say…”Kids in sport stay out of court”) I grew up on a council estate and many of my soldiers came from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds, but with the right leadership, they became amazing people. If we start to fix societal behaviour from the ground-up, then we will have a far better society.\nWe do have a drug problem in South Yorkshire, and I will assemble a task force of volunteers, including those who worked in the military, to help the police in all areas to catch the gang members. The police are under resourced, and the government is almost bankrupt, so we must do what we can off our own backs to fill this gap.\nOn theft, I shall campaign for harsher sentences, for anybody who steals tools from a van or work-site. This is stealing a worker’s ability to work and put food on the table. Motorbike theft is another area of real concern. Cars and bikes are transport, but motorcycle riders (in particular) are a different breed. For many of them, it is a freeing experience just riding their bikes, and it is a way to deal with, and to reduce and release stress, as many of my veteran friends have found. Thieves aren’t nicking a bike, they are stealing a life-saver!\nI have written about Grooming Gangs many times, and I have also worked with and helped adult survivors of the grooming gangs in South Yorkshire. I don’t care which communities get embarrassed/upset about what I’d have to say, as I want our children protected, and political correctness will go out of the window, as I will go to the nth degree to expose any perpetrators! I fully support a national inquiry into the grooming gangs.\nInvestment\nI shall look at Doncaster as if it were a team in the premiership. I will be asking monthly, how we can get companies to invest in Doncaster, and judging ourselves at the side of other cities. I will keep pushing for the title, and do not want to see Donny floundering at the bottom of the league. I will sit with businesses, both big and small, to work together to see how I can personally help them to grow their business, and cut as much red-tape as humanly possible. I will be speaking to international companies to get them interested in bringing their businesses to Doncaster. I intend to create jobs! I’ll make sure that wherever possible, the Council use local firms to supply products and services\nFree Speech\nI am fearful of the lack of free speech we now find in the UK. Doncaster will be a free speech city. We can agree to disagree, which was always the correct and British way. We must must rise above this “I’m offended at everything” mind-set, that has swept our politics and ruined good honest healthy debate.\nEnvironment\nI’m a member of the Woodland Trust, and as a qualified scuba diver, a keen oceanic environmentalist. I often take part in underwater “litter picks” around the world, to help protect marine life.\nBut…we have to stop scaring ourselves and our kids with environmental net zero catastrophe madness. We should help our youngsters live alongside nature, by offering more “Forest School” places, and teaching them conservation and not “Eco-Communism” that has infected all the main parties.\nThe current “Green Movement” that the establishment wants to push, is, as many have said now anti-human, and its supporters are water melons…Green on the outside but red on the inside!\nThere are definitely better ways we can look after our planet, but the Net Zero con will bankrupt countries and achieve nothing.\nIf you want a mayor that will deal with ALL of Doncaster’s problems, then vote for me David Bettney, and let’s end this current night-mayor!\nContact Dave at: david.bettney@sdp.org.uk",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_devon-south-west-underfunded-relative-to-other-regions-poverty-investment-in-tourism-agriculture-shipbuilding/content_21.html": "Much is made of the north of England being the neglected half of the country, with London and the south east sucking in the lion’s share of investment.\nIt is certainly true that, with both the seat of national government and the engine house of the economy – the London financial service industry – being located in the south east, this region receives the vast majority of public and private investment.\nThe north of England has received much interest and initiatives recently to help rebalance regional inequality, and rightly so. We also cannot dismiss the Barnett Formula for Scotland and the outsize investment Northern Ireland receives within the Union.\nWhat though of south west England? Beyond being thought of – at least by those able to afford such things – as a location for a second home or a staycation destination, the rest of the country does not give this part of the kingdom much thought at all.\nArguably the south west is a tale of two halves as well, with richer cities such as Bristol, Bournemouth and Swindon skewing the figures for the much poorer peninsula cities of Plymouth, Exeter and Truro. It is no surprise that the wealthier and healthier cities of the region are located the further north and east you travel from the south west. The only motorway that gets as far as the south west peninsula ends at Exeter, therefore missing out both Plymouth, a city of approximately 250,000 residents, and the entire county of Cornwall.\nIt is noteworthy that in the current financial year the NHS allocated the third highest amount of money per head of population to the south west Intergrated Care Board, at £1,536. The formula for working this sum of money out is based on various factors that determine the need of the population, poverty being a high indicator of poor health outcomes, and so generating a need for greater funding. With no national strategy for improving the local economy to create greater wealth for the region then the south west will continue to require an outsize proportion of healthcare spending per head of population.\nThis is the same for education. There are approximately 41,070 pupils in Devon with per pupil funding of £11,823.96. Bradford with a similar number of pupils has £11,765.09 per pupil. Oxfordshire on the other hand has per pupil funding of £11,293.00. Again, we can see that the poorer parts of the nation require greater funding to make up for other inequalities. The same goes to transportation too. The total expenditure on transport per head of capita in the south west is vastly lower than in London – the runaway leader in the UK for this type of investment. The south west has the second lowest expenditure and far below the average investment.\nThis is all connected. It should be of no surprise that regions that receive greater funding for transport also receive more in private investment, have wealthier local citizens, healthier citizens and thus require less in healthcare and education investment.\nIt would be a logical net win to both the south west and the rest of the country for there to be a coherent economic growth strategy providing improved transport infrastructure spending. Along side this should be the roll-out of broadband infrastructure and the optimisation of the industries in which the south west can excel – tourism, defence, agriculture and fishing.\nThe largest city in the peninsula, Plymouth, hasn’t had an operational airport for over a decade, with the city council stuck in a dispute with the leaseholder over its desire to build some homes over the site. This will neither assist greatly with the housing crisis, given that it would deliver at best a few hundred homes, nor will it turbo charge the cities economy for tourism. Likewise, the defence industry has seen massive decline for decades with a once proud tradition of shipbuilding reduced to a rump.\nGiven the current and foreseeable geopolitical turmoil and danger evident to the nation, the government should be investing heavily in the region’s shipyards. There is no reason why South Korea can develop a world class shipbuilding industry for an export market delivering jobs and better lives for its citizens, but our nation cannot. Similarly, in agriculture – where is the strategy for improving the export market conditions or researching technological improvement?\nThe politics of the south west is currently and overwhelmingly represented by the Conservative Party, but this was not always so, with the Liberal Democrats and Labour enjoying substantial support in recent memory. If a political party can tap into the mood of the region, and provide it with a beacon of hope for the future, the south west could become a bastion of support, and perhaps even a stepping stone to future government.\nReferences:\nBritain should adopt a Federal Lander system similar to Germany a complete Decentralised Government system is much healthier outcome than the top down Bureaucratic We currently have it’s the SDP who should be the replacement for the tired 4 useless parties Lib-Lab-Con-SNP\nSo on this the North South divide.is often talked about and well documented however just as well documented but often not talked about is those of us that live South of Bristol.\nI’ve interacted with many a politician who seem to think that the whole of the South is rich and wealthy, however you go past Bristol into Plymouth (my City) and Cornwall and we have poverty and issues comparable to that of Liverpool, Manchester etc.\nThe South West does have some wealthy second home owners but your everyday locals aren’t wealthy infact compared to the UK national average of a take home pay of 40k a year Plymouth and Cornwall average out at 31.6 and 31.3 k average per year, infact compare that to Liverpool’s average of £36 k, or Manchester’s Bury of 32.6 K and you ll see that here in the South West far from being this place of super wealthy locals.\nWe are well below the national average and have rates similar to some of the places talked up the most in the North South Divide. But that’s my point it’s not a North South Divide it’s a not being central divide the truth is this, the further out from London you get the poorer you tend to get.\nNow that’s a generalisation so it’s not perfect, as for the old Neo Liberal addage of get on your bike I can’t agree with that and I never will. I love my city have a great admiration for my fellow Plymouthians and Cornish banter aside that we enjoy with Cornwall I feel the same about Cornwall.\nI will say that redundancy happens a lot here and we have lots of people on their 3rd or 4th career hard working people who have been reduced to subsisting on what remains of welfare.\nBecause despite what some may say those who abuse and fiddle unemployment are in the minority and the cruel and unusual way people are sanctioned into receiving nothing is a massive gaping whole that has been carved into the social net of this country its why I made the comment I did about the UBI video here on Reddit.\nI myself am on my 3rd career started in Early Years Education moved into Adult Education was.made redundant from that and I am now a civil servant ( a good chunk of us aren’t anywhere near Whitehall)\nI wholeheartedly agree about short termnismn, one of my personal favourite Social Democrats President Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) once said\n“A few timid people, who fear progress, will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing.

As a new member I’m just waiting on membership card and it all be confirmed. I’m extremely passionate about the plight of the real locals in the south west.\nA very interesting insight into the south-west and how this region’s economy can be improved and it seems that spending on transport is a key factor here for improving investment in the area. It is has also been historically a key agricultural region and perhaps the SDP can really promote its recent Green Paper on Agriculture and the Countryside to show people that is a party committed to helping promote and invest in agriculture and consequently rural communities.",

We will return natural monopolies and utilities to public ownership and build capability to manufacture and maintain our own infrastructure.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- The contribution of nuclear energy to Britain’s electricity mix will be increased from 12% to 40% by 2035. We will renew our existing nuclear plants and develop new large-scale Generation IV reactors and small modular reactors. Planning rules for the approval of new nuclear facilities will be streamlined.\n- We will re-nationalise power supply and distribution via a new body, ‘British Energy’ which will also be responsible for implementing the UK’s energy strategy, and the underwriting and construction of new power generation plants and infrastructure.\n- We accept the broad scientific consensus that fossil fuels are contributing to climate change and that we need to reduce our aggregate usage of them ; however, we do not support unrealistic objectives such as “Net Zero” which lead to an unbalanced and costly energy regime in the UK without materially impacting global warming.\n- British Energy will develop a regulatory framework to support UK gas fracking and carbon capture and storage subject to adequate environmental assessments, and for so long as natural gas remains a necessary part of our energy fuel mix. North Sea oil and gas exploration will be given a stable taxation regime to encourage investment and new permits for exploration and production will be expedited.\n- An energy security programme will be developed to ensure that the UK has energy resources in place to guarantee 12 months’ reserve supply. This will include the use of all domestic energy resources, from renewables through to traditional sources.\n- Expenditure on heat pumps, insulation, household solar panel systems and double/triple glazing by registered suppliers will be tax deductible at the basic rate.\n- Research into battery technology, hydrogen, nuclear energy, tidal, and low-energy transport will be supported by £4bn of additional funding.\n- Water supply and management is a natural monopoly and it should be returned to public control when public finances allow. We will set capital investment targets to reduce and prevent future discharges, and consumer charges/incentives for conservation and dividends to shareholders in private water companies (where applicable) will be aligned with this goal.\n- The British Sovereign Wealth Fund will invest selectively in projects which advance national energy efficiency and self-sufficiency.",

However, population growth, indifference and poor planning threaten our natural landscapes and the riches they provide. Some institutions charged with protecting our wildlife and historic sites have abandoned their core purpose in favour of fashionable ideologies. Abstract international targets set by supranational organisations distract us from achieving meaningful local environmental improvements. We need to protect our natural and historic environment from further loss and embark on a long and careful period of restoration.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- A national land-use plan will be produced to optimise use of our limited space and ensure that the interests of nature conservation, food security, energy security, housing, infrastructure and landscape quality are balanced.\n- We will support increased use of the greenbelt for smallholdings, county farms, allotments, market gardens and community orchards. Private sector housing development on greenbelt or high-grade agricultural land will be prohibited.\n- We shall mandate energy efficiency into the planning and building regulations system. Subsidies will be available for solar panel installations on existing commercial and residential buildings. Planning consent will not be granted for solar farms on agricultural land.\n- Single-use plastic in food retail and catering will be phased out within 3 years. Mandatory returnable deposits on drinks containers and toxic waste products such as batteries will be introduced.\n- Ancient woodland and veteran trees will be protected in both urban and rural environments. National tree cover will be increased – always abiding by the principle of ‘right tree, right place, right reason’. Agroforestry practices incorporating managed grazing will be supported. A national hedgerow protection and restoration plan will be implemented.\n- We will clean up our rivers by setting capital investment targets to prevent sewage discharges, by supporting farmers to reduce livestock density in sensitive catchments, and by robust enforcement of all water pollution regulations.\n- We will implement, monitor and maintain an ecologically coherent network of Marine Protected Areas, including Highly Protected Marine Areas, in consultation with all stakeholders.\n- We will protect our historic buildings and landscape features, and ensure that the responsible institutions focus on this core purpose. We will support parish councils and community groups to prevent churches from falling into a state of disrepair.\n- We will enhance the public realm in our towns, cities and villages through sensitive planning and development, a zero-tolerance approach to vandalism and graffiti, and by funding local authorities to recruit, train and pay unemployed people to deliver civic improvement projects.\n- Overwhelming focus on climate ‘catastrophe’ is fostering anxiety and despair in children. From early years to key stage 3, all children will learn about British wildlife and given opportunities to carry out practical conservation in their local area.

It’s where I was born and has always been my home. As the daughter of a taxi driver, some of my earliest memories are of my Dad learning the Knowledge of London; he’d never hesitate to identify street names or tell the family the best routes for travel. He was proud to drive round London and take tourists to all the famous locations. I’ve ended up travelling around London a lot too. Working as a nurse in hospitals and in the community, I’ve seen how the city has changed. Poor living conditions, lack of community, division, increases in crime, unreliable public transport: many people feel like politicians have let them down and they never get the change they were promised.\nThe SDP is growing in numbers because its policies speak to this. The SDP actually want to solve problems rather than scoring political points. More and more people are noticing this. I am so pleased to be representing a party that is giving people hope for a new kind of politics. I think this is so vital. I’m looking forward to seeing it grow and being a part of that. I’m really looking forward to running the best campaign we can. Thank you so much to the SDP London members who voted during the selection process. Let’s go!”\nSDP Leader William Clouston commented:\n“I’m absolutely delighted that the SDP has selected Amy Gallagher as its London Mayoral candidate. Amy has lived in London all her life and has invaluable experience as a community nurse – but what’s really impressive is the bravery she showed as a whistleblower at the Tavistock Clinic to stand up to divisive and harmful ideology.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_on-loneliness-and-mental-health/content_43.html": "Lockdown is damaging our mental health – and not just those with an already diagnosed disorder. A far greater number are becoming affected by that more common yet easily overlooked condition: loneliness.\nThe media has picked up on the issue recently. Those interviewed have been as diverse a group of people as you could imagine. We are all susceptible.\nThe Campaign to End Loneliness says loneliness is getting worse, with nine million people in the UK describing themselves as such, four million of them elderly. It points out that loneliness is bad for physical as well as mental health, increasing not just your chances of becoming depressed, but also of succumbing to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and cognitive decline.\nAt this point I could attempt to distinguish between solitude and loneliness, reflect on how our understanding of them has evolved, and look at the impact that psychotherapy and neuroscience has had on the way we see them. But, for the purposes of this short article, it’s the absence of close relationships that concerns me, and the way in which this represents an ordinary unmet human need.\nMost of us experience loneliness at times in our life. However, this pandemic, or rather the policies governments have used to tackle it, have heightened our growing social isolation.\nThe Samaritans have been at pains to assure us that suicide rates have not risen significantly this year. This is comforting, but we know these tragedies are the tip of an iceberg.\nWe have to be realistic. Loneliness will not be eradicated; nor will the many factors contributing to its prevalence be overcome easily. But we can note the ways our lives have changed over the years, chart the unintended consequences of social, economic and technological developments, and begin to push back against evidently harmful trends.\nSome trends will be easier to tackle than others. Mental illness is notoriously subjective. While resilience falls out of fashion, claiming victimhood or the inability to cope seems all the rage. Mental health professionals are clearly at risk of being incentivised by this learned helplessness.\nNevertheless, the SDP believes there should be greater funding for mental health services, its share of overall NHS spending increasing for as long as mental illness continues to rise.\nPrevention, however, is better than cure, and it’s no mistake that our party’s watchwords are: Family, Community, Nation.\nFamily life has been under attack for decades, with disastrous consequences. It’s why the SDP benchmarks every policy against how well it promotes the family as an institution. And it’s why we campaign for affordable housing, improved wages for the young and low-paid, and tax breaks for couples raising children.\nEven through a wider lens, our policies stay true to those watchwords. We note that, while many are quick to claim rights, too few embrace responsibilities. We campaign for a more equal society underpinned by unifying values. We wish to row back from unchecked globalisation, the damaging effects of which have become obvious. And our criticism of continued lockdowns has highlighted their social as well as economic consequences.\nFor this is the ground on which we believe communitarian impulses in public life can flourish. While identity politics seeks to divide us, and the liberal-left abandons the politics of solidarity for those of division, we believe in mutuality.\nThe ties that bind us should be used to revitalise our culture and reshape our politics. We are social beings, and it’s taking nothing away from our glorious individuality to say that the vast majority of us crave community and a sense of belonging.\nhttps://www.saveourrights.uk\nWe need to take back Our rights from an authoritarian Government the SDP could be part of that change\nAnother factor that has contributed to mental health (or lack thereof) is the atomisation of the family unit and community generally. When ones sense of identity, who they are, where they fit in society et al is removed it is only reasonable to expect depression, loneliness and feelings of isolation to be front and centre. I wonder if the SDP have any policy ideas on addressing this? I would be interested to hear\nHi Andrew,\nTo answer your question: Absolutely we do. You will see that the family is central to our vision of the good society. Here’s a good place to start: https://sdp.org.uk/policies/the-family/\nRegards,\nAndrew Bence\nI am unsure about whether you are advocating a return to the traditional married family. If this is what is being proposed I would be totally supportive. The breakdown of the traditional married family has been responsible for many of society’s problems. SDP should champion the traditional family and promote tax regimes that support the structure\nI reluctantly read this article but was relieved that it was what I hoped it would be rather than dreaded. Once again I’m glad to be an SDP (new) member still getting to know you.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_what-was-the-afghan-war-for/content_301.html": "No one knows whether the fall of Kabul will mark the beginning of the end of Pax Americana. If so, the world will lose an imperfect but generally well-meaning hegemon and may obtain a more brutal and possibly more effective successor. An America built on the English ideas of individual freedom and liberty couldn’t help believing that the world wanted to adopt the same values. The Taliban – victors in the 20 year conflict in Afghanistan – had other ideas.\nMuch will be written about the reasons the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan in 2001. The proximate reason, to pursue Osama bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation who were responsible for the 9/11 attacks, was quickly supplanted by a long process of ‘mission creep’ involving nation-building and investment costing the United States over $978bn and over 2,300 lives. Britain has suffered the loss of 457 service personnel and has spent an estimated £39bn – apparently to little lasting effect.\nYet, despite all that was spent, Afghanistan remains an inept beggar state where foreign aid accounts for 43% of GDP. After 20 years of investment Afghanistan is less self-reliant than it was in 2001. Of all the justifications for intervention the idea that it would reduce terrorist incidents across the West is the perhaps least convincing. If anything, the subsequent migrant wave following our defeat – and the failure to secure effective vetting – will pose a greater long term threat to our domestic security.\nThe shocking and humiliating scenes from Kabul – as Chinooks hover in the skies above desperate Afghans – inevitably invite comparisons with the fall of Saigon in 1975. Some comparisons are indeed instructive and others are useful if only to illustrate differences. Ken Burns’ monumental 17 hour documentary ‘The Vietnam War’ has become an essential study into both the folly of war and the perils of ‘sunk cost’ thinking as applied to military conflict. By the late 1960s American infantry and the Viet Cong would bitterly contest hill tops in vicious fire-fights only to relinquish these broken hillocks days later once a point had been made. And yet the point itself was unclear. Superficially the war was an ideological conflict between the free world and communism but, at root, Ho Chi Minh and his people sought national liberation and a Vietnam free of foreign domination – be it French or American. This bears similarities to Afghanistan in that foreign powers propping up unpopular kleptocrats invite rejection.\nPerhaps the most striking thing about US and NATO intervention in Afghanistan is that, like Vietnam, it ignored the failure of another European power in the same theatre of war just years earlier. The defeat of the French in the first Indochina war and their rout at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 did not dissuade President Kennedy from intervention. Despite being advised in written communication at the outset in 1962 that ‘these people hate us’ and that ‘we cannot win’ Kennedy, along with his successor Lyndon Johnson, was gradually drawn into a conflict which lasted, all told, for 20 years and ended in abject failure. Likewise, nothing of the Soviet experience of armed intervention in Afghanistan seems to have suggested to President Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Tony Blair and the rest of the neocons that a similar experiment might be foolish, far-fetched or even imbecilic. They rolled in anyway.\nWhilst Vietnam and Afghanistan are markedly different societies, a profound ignorance of them by American policymakers is a common factor which contributed to failure. Interestingly, cultural remoteness from foreign theatres of war also plays a key role in the ability of US and other forces of intervention to kill innocent non-combatants with impunity. The process of wartime induced de-humanisation is a key observation of countless witnesses in Burns’ documentary. The lightness with which Blair, Bush and subsequent leaders such as Barack Obama have sanctioned bomb and drone attacks which kill ordinary members of the public across the world may have been facilitated by 21st century technology, but it was powered by the same mindset that saw Agent Orange once sprayed across the Vietnamese countryside.\nWhile the biggest cost of such wars is in human life, the extent to which Western leaders have robbed their domestic voters of investment possibilities is truly staggering. It’s difficult to see how the inhabitants of post-industrial US cities such as Pittsburgh or Cleveland – where unemployment and an opioid epidemic has caused thousands of ‘deaths of despair’ – could imagine that their leaders are putting them first, while squandering trillions on foreign adventures.\nSo what was it all for? As the mission continued to creep, we saw the justification for intervention in Afghanistan fall back on the idea of imposing Western values such as individual freedom, democracy and women’s liberation. Despite it being a truism since John Stuart Mill’s day that democratic values emerge ‘bottom up’ within societies and cannot be artificially imposed, we nevertheless tried to remake Afghanistan in our image. As we should have expected, we failed.\nFor nearly two decades, the western foreign policy establishment has deluded itself into thinking that, somehow, they could erase the deep networks of tribal, religious, and kinship loyalties among the Afghan people. They thought they could force Afghanistan’s rural and conservative population to abandon their customs, loyalties, and beliefs, and swear allegiance to a small cabal of elites in Kabul. From this delusion, we’ve seen twenty years of death and destruction, both among our own servicemen and among the Afghan people.\nThe lessons from this? Western powers must now surely see that attempts to impose liberal democracy by intervention and lethal force are illegitimate, naive and morally suspect. Their attempts to do so have failed British servicemen, failed the ordinary citizen and failed Afghanistan.\nWhen politicians call for further interventions of ‘Global Britain’ around the world, they should pause for thought. We should remind them that while the costs of foreign adventures are high and their aims are so often unattainable, priorities also exist at home.\nPedants corner – paragraph 2, sentence 1: “Much will be written about the reasons the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan in 1991.” The invasion was in 2001. 1991 is also erroneously mentioned further in the same paragraph.\nA more meaningful comment, and one which may not be popular, but the British Empire was actually relatively successful at nation-building; the difference is it was in it for the long haul. The recent Afghanistan venture could have been successful, but it would have taken generations, perhaps a century or more. No modern western democracy has the stomach for that, and rightly so. Let’s see how China gets on with it now!\nField Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, once said in the House of Lords:\n“Rule 1, on page 1 of the book of war, is: “Do not march on Moscow”. Various people have tried it, Napoleon and Hitler, and it is no good. That is the first rule. I do not know whether your Lordships will know Rule 2 of war. It is: “Do not go fighting with your land armies in China”. It is a vast country, with no clearly defined objectives.”\nPerhaps if he were around today he might consider that “Do not march into Afghanistan” would be Rule 3, or even vying for top place in “The book of War”?!\nVery wise.\nMontgomery was always a wise man unlike Eisenhower or buffoon Patton\nI’m curious why you are not calling out the shameful behaviour of HMG during the withdrawal. How could the UK have had no prior knowledge of the withdrawal timetable from our close ally the US, and if they really had no idea, who in the intelligence service is going to resign? How can we trust a military where the top brass go on TV to say the Taliban have changed, only to check the other channel to see them shooting people in the street and parading lines of jihadists carrying US weapons. The debate over overseas intervention has been held and won, there are very few who support these overseas interventions. Looking forward we need a complete overhaul of the intelligence service, who seem to have been more devoted to helping get Biden elected as President than protecting British interests.\nWe should have never got involved in any half-assed American war whatsoever Blair needs to still be held accountable, there is no special relationship and never has been, We need a complete independent foreign policy free of the USA and NATO, We need to rebuild our military capabilities it is idiotic to rely on other countries to protect us\nHard to disagree with any of that (‘What was Afghan War for’).\nHarold Wilson was, in my recollection, much maligned when in office but history continues to show what a service he did for this country in keeping us out of Vietnam. Leaders who have experienced war first hand seem to have a better record in avoiding conflict than those who have not.\nThe reality is Britain lacks the military capability to defend itself against larger states, having run down our armed forces over decades. We rely on the US as a powerful ally to defend us instead. The unfortunate consequence of that reliance is we have to “defend” the US when it perceives itself to be under attack if we want them to continue to defend us. We can’t afford to upset them.\nUnfortunately, the US is a nation perceiving itself to be under attack from itself, because Americans have never reconciled themselves since their Civil War 160 years ago. Those in the South who still support the Confederate cause still don’t trust the central government and therefore arm themselves heavily in case the army ever comes against them again. Those in the North who support emancipation are ever seeking new oppressed minorities to champion and will not tolerate the opinions of those armed Southerners who occasionally take the law into their own hands and massacre people they disagree with. They argue the opinions must be censored because they motivate the violence. Both sides perceive themselves to be under attack and in that fear-filled ethos any external threat provides something they can unite against and against which they perceive violence as the most natural response.\nIt is foolish to think values such as innocent until proven guilty and The Rule of Law can be upheld by summary killing of suspects, many of whom were actually informed against by people with a grudge rather than reliable sources. If Western values are to be copied (probably in modified form) by others they need to be seen to be fairer and better so people actually want them. We must lead by example, not imposition. We might also recognise others have good ideas too and we could learn from them.\nMost British people thought the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq ill-judged and dangerous, I think, knowing they would damage rather than enhance Britain’s reputation around the world, but the politicians ultimately had to stay in with the US because they couldn’t afford otherwise.\nUntil we have our own credible forces independent of allies abroad (though those will always be welcome) we will be forced to collude in this folly.\nIs one of the lessons from Afghanistan and other failed interventions that when we talk to the inhabitants of these countries in high level meetings, our politicians only speak to westernised, rich elites who want the intervention, never ordinary people, say villagers and rural workers. The local elites of couse rely on the ‘investment’ promised from NGOs the Military-Industrial Complex, and our business leafers so called, wining and dining them, and thus our policy makers are deluded by lobbyists into thinking supra- national intervention is broadly welcomed by the foreign e.g. Afghan population.\nShades of the Remainer/Brexit debate in the UK perhaps?\nI fully agree with you. We should have sent Special Forces who are small and can operate undercover to hunt and kill Al Qaeda. Sending ground troops was major error and we learnt nothing from the Soviets. However if we in the west had not armed them like Saddam. Problem would have been easier.\nMany problems are the fault of Western Nations selling arms to unstable regimes. Who at the time we are told they are friends of ours. In reality there not. Look at Saudi Araba as another example a nation which sponsors terrorism alongside the Iranians. British and other western weapons are used in Yemen. Which not brings hate for Saudi Araba but for the west in general.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-great-immigration-pause-an-sdp-idea-whose-time-has-come/content_197.html": "With the election of the supposedly ‘moderate’, ‘soft left’ lawyer Sir Keir Starmer as Labour leader, most observers would agree that it has become harder to claim the mantle of social democracy from the Labour Party.\nNow that the extremist Corbyn regime is history, those Labour MPs who see themselves as social democrats have a much better alibi for taking the easy path and staying put.\nHowever the direction of Labour policy under Starmer already demonstrates that genuine social democracy is not going to prosper in his regime. It is quite clear that the now-familiar metropolitan, liberal-left perspective that unites Blairites and Corbynites will remain completely dominant.\nThe Blue Labour caucus, which emphasises social solidarity within the nation state, seems even more forlorn now than under Corbyn, who at least had a record of opposing EU power grabs because of his dedication to the notion of achieving ‘socialism in one country’.\nThe Starmer leadership has seen Labour declare that the UK should continue to be governed by European Union regulations and laws into 2021 and beyond, with the party now calling for transition to carry on indefinitely, until a ‘deal’ is reached with Brussels on our future relationship.\nMore tellingly, Starmer has led his MPs in a clear direction on immigration. Despite the coronavirus slump being projected to leave one in three British 18- to 24-year-olds unemployed by the autumn, Labour is crossing swords with Priti Patel in a bid to preserve free movement into the UK jobs market from all EU countries.\nAt the same time, the party has said nothing about the scandalous spectacle of dinghies crossing the English Channel crammed with young men from Africa and Asia and being escorted into port by the UK Border Force.\nNeither has it criticised the Government for overseeing another year of net immigration above a quarter of a million – despite all the pressures that places on social cohesion, housing and public services.\nDuring his campaign for the Labour leadership, Starmer came out with a series of pledges on immigration, each designed to please the large majority of party activists who wish to dismantle controls. As well as supporting continued free movement, he also wishes to close immigration removal centres such as Yarl’s Wood and outlaw indefinite detention of failed asylum-seekers.\nThere is every sign that, under Starmer, Labour will move further in the direction of explicitly supporting the ideology of ‘global citizenship’, thereby effectively repudiating the idea of the nation state and the notion that citizens might have higher bonds of loyalty and mutual obligation to each other than outsiders.\nThis is a betrayal of the values and interests of working class communities across Britain and, I would argue, of the outlook of the celebrated 1945 Attlee administration which was galvanised by the idea of a national family, with the new National Health Service being funded by a system of National Insurance.\nThere is a baton here to be picked up by the Social Democratic Party. We must never be intimidated into accepting the false suggestion that broad affinity to the nation state and a sense of higher obligation to compatriots are regressive ideas or that wishing to control international immigration is necessarily ‘right wing’.\nIn fact, with Boris Johnson’s Tories increasingly exposed as paying mere lip-service to the idea of lower immigration, we should be toughening up our policies.\nAs vacancies plummet and unemployment among Britons soars, as our housing stock is increasingly exposed as inadequate for the size of population and as coronavirus shows how high density population can be an acute public health risk, it is time to be bolder.\nA significant pause to this era of mass immigration should be our goal: to allow social cohesion to recover; to facilitate better integration into core British values within some poorly integrated minority communities and to protect the job prospects, wage levels, housing conditions and access to public services enjoyed by working class people in general.\nFor the SDP to argue for a ‘great immigration pause’ would show that we are not prepared to allow such common sense territory to be monopolised by the Right’s great showman populist Nigel Farage.\nI am not, of course, arguing for a halt to all immigration. In an open-minded country like Britain there will always be a place for those from overseas whose skills can add value to our economy and society.\nNevertheless, I think very low net inward migration should be a clear goal for the SDP now. Low gross immigration should be another: so communities can have a breather from 20 years of breakneck change – and so we can start to get to know each other once more, as neighbours and fellow citizens.\nWe must reclaim the idea of strong immigration control as an enlightened social force. The modern liberal-left, under Starmer, yearns for a future of ‘no borders’. That is not what voters in the former Red Wall seats who turned Tory in December believe in. If and when the Tories let them down, we should be there to pick them up.\nTotally agree.\nA good read. Ignore the current non-EU net migration figures; they are a work of fiction. According to the net migration rate we should have had 282,000 net migrants last year. According to the Annual Population Survey/Labour Force Survey, the non-EU born population grew by 123,000 from 5,743,000 to 5,866,000. One of these statistic is wrong and it’s not the APS/LPS. The Home Office’s records on non-EU visas entries and exits also shows a significantly lower net rate but is not used to calculate net migration; only the International Passenger Survey is used and it’s totally unreliable. Let’s never forget, the previous Labour government increased net migration greatly without any democratic consent to do so as the policy change was not stated. Neither were we told or asked. When people say net migration needs to be greatly reduced, they are correct to do so and have need to offer an explanation other than for democratic reasons\nI completely agree. I am not anti immigration, having decended from Huguenot immigrants myself, but I am against any open door policy.\nThank you, Richard. much welcomed. I live near Canterbury; a city built on huguenot ancestry. Th inflow of immigrants, which is essential, and outflow of emigrants, the reason why it’s essential, must be in balance. A loose aim of Zero net migration give or take several 10,000’s a year must become the SDP policy.\nI have enormous sympathy with the SDP’s nuanced position on immigration, and the way the party brings reason and moderation to the debate. And I am in sympathy with its view of nationhood in the sense of “somewheres versus anywheres”.\nNevertheless, there are parts of this piece that make me feel a bit uncomfortable. For example, Patrick seems to imply that he is in favour of *indefinite* detention of failed asylum seekers, which is surely not moral? Better to get through the process effectively and efficiently as possible.\nSecond, I feel a bit dubious about places like Yarls Wood. I visited an immigration detention centre in Cambridgeshire once, and it did not seem a humane way of treating people who may have fled persecution and torture. I seem to recall also that Yarls Wood had a terrible reputation for its long term detention of women and children.\nSurely the nuance in the SDP allows for both its “somewheres not anywheres” philosophy; its approach to economic migration that defends the interest of the nation (as well as the interests of the migrants themselves and their families); and yet at the same time has a compassionate approach to those claiming asylum that does not involve detaining them indefinitely in places like Yarls Wood?\nYes. It makes sense that Britain allows people in the ten of thousands to come if they have guaranteed work and it helps if they speak English as it’s our language and they will need it to assimilate into our communities easily. But what sense does it make to keep allowing people into the country when we don’t have enough homes? We actually need to solve the housing crisis first and that’s a clear reason on why we need to lower the immigration numbers in the first place.\nI agree that the SDP does need to toughen up it’s policies and needs to be both clear and firm on where it stands on immigration. You don’t want to look as weak as Labour or the Tories. Immigration is still a big issue that still plays on the average voter’s mind and many are looking for a party who will “stick to their word” and carry out those policies. Theresa May looked professional as Home Secretary, but what did she actually do?\nFinally, I think the SDP also needs to talk about the points system, work visas, migrant crime and the deportations of migrant criminals. I understand they are “heavy issues” that I’m sure many people would rather avoid, but they are issues I see discussed on social media a lot and I think the SDP could do with addressing those things.\nWe need imigration, the ebb and flow of migration is on the whole beneficial to a nation, but our unfettered open door policy encouraged by Sir Keirs, new Labour can only cause more long term issues for workers and households. How can we ever hear common sense from our Politicians when it comes to imigration as any mention of control is imediately condemmed as racism, by the liberal left?\nI agree entirely. Migration at a modest scale is natural and invigorating but rapid mass immigration has been socially disruptive and economically neutral at best. Because we were already well below self-sufficiency, the artificial increase in our number of some 6m people has also increased our heavy reliance on imported food, energy and raw materials, and thus our vulnerability to any disruption in their supply.\nWe are 67m people in a world of 7.7bn. Our crowded little country simply cannot accommodate the many, many millions more who would like to live here, whatever the reasons. Yes, we should exercise compassion for those in less fortunate countries but by helping them to flourish in situ, not by weakening ourselves.\nYou need to be careful about who is counted as an immigrant-students, wives joining their husbands established here, the seasonal worker sending his remittance back to his impoverished family? The allready well off who can bring his/her ‘talents’ to this country-and away from their own nation?That said it is a clear argument and stance to really fulfil the ‘Let’s get Brexit done’ mantra.\nmost immigrants I have encountered over the Years have contributed enormously We cannot continue with the levels that happened during the Blair/Brown Labour era, now We are out of the EU We can decide who enters now not someone over in Europe who no-one has heard of, Labour are still obsessed with immigration 10 Years out of Office they still have not learned the error of their Ways\n“A great immigration pause” is an idea that could resonate with a large swathe of the electorate on both the left and right, but the party would have to flesh out a number of grey areas such as,\n– How would the party stop immigration creeping up as special interest groups claim they need foreign labour be they skilled, unskilled or academic.\n– How would the party would commit to promising a generational halt to mass immigration when the electorate might vote parties into power that had differing views on this matter to the SDP during the 20-30 year suspension period?\n– Would pausing immigration mean starting from scratch and returning all illegal immigrants now in this country or would they be all given permission to stay and the slate started from when the SDP is elected to govern?\n– How would the party deal with the expected criticisms from pro-immigration parties and others who would label this as a racist, far right idea?\nHavig said the above I still believe it a note worthy idea and perhaps a manifesto pledge.\nPersonally, I’d like to see the term “net zero” repurposed for immigration. There’s a marketing idea for you!\nKeir Starmer the biggest Red Tory in parliament\nYes I would vote for a TOTAL halt on immigration for at least 20 years. We must also start turning the dinghies around as they do in Australia & deport all failed asylum seekers immediately, no ifs or buts. There must also be a concerted effort to search out & deport illegals.\nThis country immigration problems? Legal or illegal. Net zero !",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_lets-keep-our-universities-open/content_375.html": "SOMETIMES in science the most telling experiments happen by accident rather than by design.\nOne thinks of the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming after he spotted how mould on a carelessly discarded petri dish had prevented the growth of staphylococci. Or Edward Jenner noticing that milkmaids who had had the non-fatal cowpox did not go on to contract fatal smallpox during epidemics of it.\nWell, right now nature has created an almost perfect experiment for us by arranging a Covid outbreak centred around two halls of residence at the University of Glasgow.\nAs of Wednesday there were 124 confirmed cases, with hundreds more suspected. However the University acknowledged that it was not aware of a single student hospitalised as a result. Of course, as the outbreak goes on it may be that some hospitalisations do occur. Yet this is a notable finding.\nTo date a major Covid outbreak hitting people solely in the 18-22 age range has not left any of them seriously ill, has put almost no pressure on the local healthcare system and none at all on hospitals.\nEven better, by the end of it a large number of people will have acquired at least partial resistance to Covid (re-infections are vanishingly rare to date), helping to build a community immunity that can in due course help to protect people in more vulnerable groups from infection.\nWe already knew that the disease was much less dangerous for younger age groups, but the Glasgow University outbreak is a dramatic illustration of this. In my view it leads inexorably to a conclusion that policy from UK and devolved Governments towards a large section of young adults is badly misconceived.\nRather than shutting down normal undergraduate life a better path, as far as public health considerations go, would be to encourage students to lead their normal lives and universities to offer the full range of their normal activities. Students largely seclude themselves from the rest of us – and we from them – in any case.\nThey tend to drink in their own pubs or student union bars and to positively go out of their way to avoid extensive contact with older people.\nObviously, it would be foolish to send a load of undergrads to do voluntary work in care homes, and they would do well to observe the general distancing rules when shopping or on public transport. It would also be sensible of universities to encourage their more elderly or less healthy teaching staff to take sabbaticals and push more keen young postgraduates into face-to-face teaching roles.\nBut apart from that there would appear to be many more upsides than downsides to undergraduates having a normal university experience and getting Covid – and getting over it – before the onset of winter.\nInstead the policy of universities, at the behest of the Government, is to force hundreds of undergraduates into lockdown every time there is an outbreak at their university so that the minimal possible number of them contract the disease. This will simply impede progress towards community immunity and risk future outbreaks taking place smack in the middle of the winter spike in general demand that always hits the NHS.\nIf the Glasgow episode is a reliable guide to the disease profile among young adults – and there was already a lot of evidence to suggest that it is – then some gentle advice for students to avoid local oldsters and to local oldsters to give students a wide berth for the time being (going with the grain of normal preferences for each group) is pretty much all that we need.\nWouldn’t it be wonderful if in future years the University of Glasgow’s Covid outbreak was cited in medical journals as being the key to a breakthrough in Britain’s management of the disease? For that to happen we need our policymakers to ditch their panic and extreme caution and think things through instead.\nThe SDP has already shown the way ahead on this score. It’s a crying shame that no party with representation in the House of Commons seems capable of doing the same.\nCan the major parties be challenged somehow to explain publicly why this is not a common sense approach ?\nCan the SDP get a clinical expert to endorse this article so that the UK Parliament will be encouraged to review the approach?\nIn a big fan of Patrick O’Flynn and Rod Liddle. They are a huge reason why I joined the SDP.\nI wrote an article recently about the BBC and its immoral payment collecting operation, but was told it is too “tabloidy” for the party! I thought Brexiteer council estate folk were supposed to be welcomed? A huge mistake UKIP made at their peak, in my opinion, was to ignore them and their ideas. I will remain a member, but felt disappointed by those comments.\nPerhaps a “tabloidy” style SDP page could be formed to attract fellow voters who are politically homeless? Just a thought.\nI couldn’t agree more! And let and sentient grandparents /other mentally capable vulnerable relationsdecide for themselves if they would like to see their grandchildren at Christmas-or any other time and if so, what measures, if any, they would like them to observe or no hugging, social distancing etc etc\nWe are supposed to be caring about the old and vulnerable , but not allowing them access to family, love, physical contact, ministers or religion is uncaring in the extreme to the point of being cruel. Worst thing that could have happened to us is the PM getting a bad case of Covid.-it seems to have dissolved his resolve and and gobbled up any true libertarian instincts he had-… as we march blithely,nay enthusiastically, into totalitarian Big Brotherdom.\nThe Government acts on scientific advice. The problem is, you get the scientific advice you commission. By that I don’t mean the advisers tell the government what they want to hear, but that they only address the remit they’re given. The task is to advise how deaths from CoViD can be minimised, so that is the advice they receive.\nOf course, the task should be different; how in this circumstance can we minimise the harm to the population as a whole, including unnecessary loss of life?\nGiven that life is a limited commodity for each and every one of us, loss of life can be measured for a population as person-years. It seems everyone, on the current strategy, is set to lose at least one year of life now, because the restrictions have a serious impact on our ability to live and progress through life as we normally would, so the lockdown will cause the loss of 63 million person-years of life. Remember, those of us who are losing a year of life to the lockdown will never get it back. One day we will all die, having lost a year of opportunity or whatever else life would have thrown at us. We can never get that lost time back; our time is limited and finite. To stop life for a year is to lose a year from our life. That is lost for ever, whether it is our first year, a year from the middle, or our last. 63 million person years are being lost. 32 million person-years have already been taken from us.\nCan this be justified by the life saved? The threat was of up to 500,000 deaths. These would mostly, but not exclusively, be of people who are very sick, many of whom would be in their last year or two of life. So if, for example, CoViD deaths totalling 500,000 were 50% from people who would otherwise have lived for two more years, 30% from people who would have survived a further 10 years, and 20% from people with an expected 40 years left, that would equal 2 x 250,000 + 10 x 150,000 + 40 x 100,000 = 6 million person-years, less than a tenth of the life lost through the lockdown. It is difficult to see how the life saved could ever come near the life lost from the population as a whole.\nThe single goal of reducing one single hazard is not an adequate expression of a government’s responsibility to protect a population against serious harm. A more rounded approach is required.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_coronapolitics-defending-the-unmeasurable/content_64.html": "The EU referendum revealed a new political dichotomy that was hidden from usual parliamentary politics under first-past-the-post.\nIt didn’t fall neatly along the traditional ‘right versus left’ axis, nor along party lines. For most Leavers, the implications of Brexit on the “measurable” (financial) took second place to the “unmeasurable” (values, identity, sovereignty).\nThis is why belligerent Remainers found their arguments about the purported economic benefits of EU membership so ineffective.\nAs with Brexit, so with coronavirus. A new divide has emerged, disrupting the fresh post-referendum alliances, blindsiding even the more astute political analysts. And just as before, both sides claim to have reason on their side, yet talk entirely past each other.\nFrom forcing the closure of businesses and public spaces to restricting the movement and association of individuals, and now to mandating the wearing of facemasks, the current level of Government interference is pretty much unprecedented in British peace-time history.\nIt has split the country.\nBroadly, those who support any of these interventions support them all; and vice versa. Whether it is lockdown, social distancing or facemasks, the likely epidemiological impact of each – the number of infections and deaths averted – is barely mentioned in debate.\nOne side tends to support almost any action, almost regardless of its intrusion, if it saves any lives. The other side disapproves of any action, almost regardless of its likely effectiveness, if it violates any liberty.\nThis sharp difference, as well as the frustrating mutual misunderstanding, is in part driven by the deeper war between the measurable and the unmeasurable.\nInterventionists argue something along the lines of, ‘if it saves lives from COVID-19, we should do it’. To oppose such a policy with a clear positive measurable outcome, in favour of an unmeasurable quantity such as liberty, is for them inconceivable, impudent and even evil.\nThis position is tempting. After all, the measure of lives lost is a horrible number; we can all understand it. A loss of liberty, on the other hand, is impossible to enumerate. Advocating for its defence becomes ever harder under the barrage of statistics, charts and figures.\nBut to be unmeasurable is not to be without value.\nLife is full of things – love of country for instance – which are cherished, yet unmeasurable. Some of the most resonant stories witness the sacrifice of something measurable (money, limb, life) for something unmeasurable (love, honour, freedom). These stories reveal a moral truth: that the gain or preservation of the unmeasurable, can sometimes be justly at the cost of the measurable – even of human life. And loss of the unmeasurable can of course lead, in turn, to loss of the measurable.\nThe liberty to leave your front door and associate with whom you want; these are unmeasurable rights that no sane person would freely renounce. At the very least, they must feature in the trade-off calculation for coronavirus policies, even if they do not tip the balance.\nConsider the facemask dispute.\nAlong with the displeasure of being commanded to wear an itchy mask, there is a dehumanising aspect of a face covering that elicits a far deeper discomfort. Much of our daily life consists in face-to-face interactions with others: smiles and frowns are just two examples in the vast repertoire of non-verbal cues that we use to relate, convey understanding, and diffuse conflict. Faces are of such profound importance to us that we recognise them in inanimate objects and reproduce them in textual communication. The unmeasurable consequences of compulsory facemasks cannot be ignored.\nThe debate evokes the McNamara fallacy: a reference to the US Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War, Robert McNamara.\nMcNamara sought a strictly numeric approach for monitoring military progress, focusing on body count, weapons, bombs dropped. Based on these figures, American success looked inevitable, and yet defeat inched ever closer. Simplifying a complex situation purely to the measurable – while dismissing the unmeasurable – led McNamara to his resignation in 1967.\nDespite this decades-old lesson, the unmeasurable has never been more threatened. Appraised not by calculation but by instinct, the unmeasurable attracts scorn from large sections of society, deeming it archaic and obsolete. In its place, we have witnessed the rise of the measurable, proceeding from the success of science and decline of religion. Numbers are pitted against sentiment; quantitative against qualitative.\nThe politics of coronavirus is only a skirmish in a greater war between the measurable and the unmeasurable. The winds are blasting behind the sails of the former.\nWe must always, however, defend the latter – even against an onslaught of data. Because sometimes that which is unmeasurable is, at the end of all things, immeasurable.\nA longer version of this article is available on Lily’s blog, here.\nA very thoughtful and thought provoking article.\nBrilliant piece.\nThe reference to McNamara’s approach to the Vietnam War is really instructive. As the Burns/Novick monumental documentary revealed, Kennedy was informed in dispatches back in 1962 that ‘these people hate us’. The President, rightly, became totally despondent about American prospects for victory but was bound by political expediency to continue what eventually became a supreme act of folly. Hearts and minds (unmeasurable) proved far more salient to the outcome of the war than McNamara’s dreadful, de-humanising and ultimately pointless (measurable) statistics.\nBrexit, Vietnam, Coronavirus – success or failure depends to a very great degree on morale, and morale is another of those things which is easy to sense, but difficult to measure.\nHugely thought provoking.\nthe Public need to stand up to this authoritarian Government COVID19 is in decline there are spikes but it is miles better than it was in March, I implore the SDP to offer the UK and the British People a much needed alternatives to the Tories or Labour neither excite anybody anymore and We as a Country needs a written constitution to guarantee our sovereignty and rights and a federal Republic on the German System preferable\nVery thought-provoking. But surely one of the problems is precisely that the ‘measurable’ has turned out to be very far from it. The number of infections has proved to be a function primarily of the number of people tested – and consequently unreliable. The number of deaths has similarly proved to be unknowable by the public, because of policy mistakes and policy changes. The chances of a ‘second wave’ or the ‘R’ number are also seemingly elusive to measure or assess correctly or even consistently.\nMeanwhile, there is also conflicting information about the effectiveness of quinine, the staying-power of antibodies, the chances of a vaccine being possible, and the likely timetable needed to produce one.\nWhen the ‘measurable’ is such an utter mess, the public has, of course, no defence against defaulting to ‘unmeasurable’ instincts.\nFor example, we still don’t know what measurable impact mask-wearing has. My ‘understanding’ is that it might make my passing on the virus to someone else slightly less likely, and my ‘understanding’ of compound interest suggests that that a small difference individually could add up to a large difference for the population. But am I right?\nBefore we act on instincts about things ‘unmeasurable’, surely the priority and urgency is to get what is measurable actually right?\nThe undeniable facts are that Covid has proven to have a lethality within the range of flu and is nowhere near as lethal as mfor example, the Hong Kong flu of 1968. The undeniable facts are that the overall U.K. death rate is at its lowest level for five years. Yet, we have been made subject to all kinds of arbitrary measures at first in the name of protecting the NHS and then in the name of ‘flattening the curve’. The sheer inanity of government policies emanating from this so-called pandemic has only been surpassed by its resort to authoritarianism. It seems to me that the SDP at best is just sitting on the fence as far as this question is concerned.\nCan anyone confirm whether the SDP now oppose lockdowns, masks etc. as a matter of policy? If so, I will join – I’ve cancelled my Conservative Party membership as I won’t want to be complicit in it all.\nYes they have.\nAt the begining of the ‘covid crisis’, there was much goodwill towards the Tory leadership and genuine concern when the PM became seriously ill with the virus. Even from those of us who from the beginning were sceptical (to say the least) endured for weeks the restrictions on personal liberty and the ‘Thursday night clap’. The task as I recall, was to ‘flatten the curve’, and protect the NHS. The curve was duly flattened and in the end the NHS was seriously underwhelmed. Having played our part as good citizens, dare I say patriots? the promised liberation was not forthcoming. When good faith and reason are cast asunder by the antics of a government that has become nothing less than a ministerial dictatorship, as is evident, there is naturally going to be trouble. The whole situation is becoming evermore volatile and is really only being held together through increasing intimidation and propaganda from the MSM, slavishly reporting the evasions and nonsense of its political masters. The Manchester Evening News, amongst others, is such a newspaper. In the end the Conservative, Parliamentary majority was achieved through support from the working class tired of the Labour Party’s attachment to identity politics and it’s gross betrayal of the referendum outcome. Even now as Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock consider sending out further dictats from Downing Street, to the dismay of many of their core supporters, it may not be obvious to Boris, that the same sense of injustice that brought him to power, will be the same sense of injustice that will be his undoing. I cannot wait.\nOn the whole I agree with this article except on one point. I am on the side which disapproves of any action which violates our liberty but not regardless of its effectiveness. There is no credible evidence that lockdowns, social distancing or mask wearing prevent the spread of the virus. If the government want to impose these inhumane draconian measures they need to have much stronger evidence of their effectiveness. If I thought for a moment that any of these measures helped to stop the spread of the virus I would comply. Otherwise I will not.\nA scientist opposed to, ‘scientism’. I’ve always thought the most valuable aspects in life are not quantifable but don’t tell the economists.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_2024_01_21_nationalise-port-talbot-steelworks/content_394.html": "The Social Democratic Party (SDP) calls for steel production at Port Talbot to be brought into public ownership – as a strategic necessity.\nThe announcement by its owners Tata Steel of the closure of both blast furnaces at the Port Talbot steel plant is a devastating blow to the community, South Wales and to UK industry. This is the culmination of decades of cluelessness in industrial policy, hostility to national planning, an unthinking – almost religious – attachment to free trade ideology and a recent obsession with net zero posturing.\nThe political class is willing to bail out bankers but is content to throw industrial workers – and their communities – on the scrapheap at enormous social and economic cost. This is self-defeating and can’t be allowed go on.\nThe loss of UK capacity to produce virgin steel will make our country an outlier among the G20 – a predicament that only the state can now remedy. Those who govern us have learned nothing from the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia Ukraine conflict which exposed our over-reliance on imported energy and other products – often from hostile powers. We must improve our national industrial resilience.\nSDP leader William Clouston commented: “The ‘do nothing’ attitude of this Tory government has run its course. It’s disastrous because it will destroy a community. It’s unpatriotic because it weakens UK industrial capacity. It’s dishonest because it won’t reduce carbon emissions – it will simply shift primary steel production overseas and make us even more reliant on imports.”\n“I’m calling for an urgent plan of action to bring the Port Talbot plant into public hands as a national strategic asset, to integrate it with allied industries such as the planned coking coal project at Whitehaven together with new UK energy production. We can re-build our industrial base – but we must elect those who are fully committed to doing so.”",

It’s the SDP’s largest field of candidates since 1987 and reflects the party’s strong resurgence in recent years. The SDP has candidates throughout the country but the party is specifically targeting its efforts in Labour strongholds like Jarrow, Leeds Central, Tottenham, Neath and Cynon Valley. Traditional Labour voters will find the SDP’s clear pro-Brexit, Social Market approach very attractive combined with its strong commitment to Railway Nationalisation, fighting crime and new Council House building.\nSDP Leader William Clouston said:\n“The Social Democrats General Election challenge is a major breakthrough for the party. We’re re-emerging as national party and I’m delighted to see SDP candidates campaigning all over the country. The SDP has a very distinctive ‘red and blue’ approach to politics which people find appealing. At a time when voters are offered a dreary choice of either ‘left’ or ‘right’ the Social Democrats propose a sensible blend of policies.\nWe want Brexit completed but we also have a wide-ranging set of polices which focus on the social aspects of life – the family, community and nation. Millions of British people are fed up with the two-party system of Labour and the Tories. People are crying out for a better alternative – which is why the SDP is growing so quickly. It’s an exciting time for the SDP.”\nThe seats which the SDP is contesting are:\nEdinburgh South West, Jarrow, Keighley, Thirsk and Malton, York Central, Leeds Central, Leeds West, Wentworth and Dearne, Warrington South, Warwick and Leamington, Cambridge, Watford, Basildon and Billericay, Epping Forest, Cynon Valley, Neath, Tottenham, Tooting, Havant, Folkestone and Hythe.\nEnds",

He claims that full assimilation within a generation or two is therefore impossible. Instead, the cultural attitudes of the immigrants shape the institutions and influence the economic productivity of their new country.\nGarett and William discuss the implications of this for migration policy, particularly in the most innovative Western nations. They agree that moderate levels of migration bring many benefits, but mass migration from poor to rich countries could ultimately “wound the goose that lays the golden eggs of global innovation and worldwide prosperity.”\nthe quality of economic inward migration to the UK perhaps correlates with the rise in fast food delivery motor scooters on every corner? so observationally some of our shire town centres are reminiscent of traffic scenes in south Asian cities, so yeah our economy is starting to look like the workers that are driving/riding it 😉\nThe Social Democratic Party is.the future of British Politics a potential Government when people British People get tired of the tired uniparty LabCon\nVery pertinent subject and book at this time. Much needed as we see the effects of immigration changing our institutions and many other aspects of British life rather more quickly than is comfortable for most people. We need to understand these things to get some foresight and control that will enable smoother integration and perhaps undo some of the damage done by Lab/Con refusing to pay attention to the calls of British people to address the need for lower immigration and better assimilation, merely suppressing concerns and turning blame on to British people rather viciously.\nI’m glad to be a member of a party that is looking into this to find ways to deal with the problems that have accumulated, not that it will be easy.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-decay-of-family-social-care/content_172.html": "Last month, the Conservative Party announced its plans to help alleviate the financial burden faced by many when paying for social care. The Chancellor declared that it would be a ‘permanent new role for government’.\nIt’s important to note that this new ‘role’ for government is purely an attempt to offer a financial remedy. The problem is simple; social care can amount to a huge financial burden, possibly even tallying to £100,000’s in one person’s lifetime. The answer is to formulate a general tax which would help mitigate such troubling circumstances.\nThis is a solution of sorts, the details of which should be closely examined.\nIn the case of social care it seems clear that something needed to change, however are we right to frame the crisis around social care as solely a financial problem?\nSurely the subject of social care is intrinsically tied to the fabric of society itself. To discuss such a natural and inevitable part of our life cycle as a financial anomaly seems inappropriate at the least. If we are to find a solution to the social care crisis we must ask difficult questions about the society we live in.\nTo the social conservative it is obvious that we should talk about the family when talking about social care. Unfortunately any serious discussions to do with the family have been avoided for too long.\nIn principle the family as a social unit should be considered the bastion of mutual support, and the place where we discover and develop our moral instincts. When these social ties are well practised, the strong will naturally help the weak. In situations when the family becomes overwhelmed by such responsibilities, there are always those from extended family or the community who can help. Of course there will always be a need for a highly trained profession of carers when the situation requires it.\nIt’s a nice thought but such a view of the family unit now seems hopelessly naïve and utterly redundant in today’s society. But why? Why have we accepted the decay of family ties?\nFor some perspective; 1 out of 8 adults (6.5 million people) carry out caring responsibilities for either the disabled or the elderly. What’s shocking is that if each of these individuals were paid an average carer salary of £19,336 per year, it would amount to £132 billion nationally. Compare this to the total NHS national budget of 2019/20; which was £150 billion.\nThis suggests two things.\nFirstly that social care has to largely remain an unpaid responsibility. Clearly these unpaid carers save the British taxpayer a monumental amount. It is simply not financially possible to bring social care under the umbrella of government welfare.\nThere is reason for concern that this new ‘role’ of government risks being too open-ended with its promises, and could even incentivise more people to give up their care responsibilities. This could ulitamtely ammount to a indefinite bill paid for by the public purse.\nSecondly; we are a nation of loving and caring people. Shouldn’t government policy be aimed at encouraging and supporting non-paid carers?\nOf course, part of this support should be financial. It’s interesting to note that the current Carer’s Allowance is only £67.25 a week for a minimum of 35 hours work, one of the lowest benefits of its kind.\nHowever any financial solution is ultimately incapable of tackling such an issue, for the simple reason that providing care requires hours of labour. This is especially obvious in cases when a live-in carer is needed.\nThe social care crisis will only be over when the majority of this labour is provided by the family unit itself. It is for this reason that we cannot dismiss or ignore the decline of family ties. Encouraging non-paid carers is synonymous with strengthening family ties. To care for one’s parents should be as natural as how parents care for their children. However, needless to say, this is not happening on a large enough scale.\nThe social care crisis is therefore a symptom of a rather shocking reality; the decay of the social fabric of society. The culprit of such demise is individualism. It has led to a society of individuals who live ever increasingly atomised lives from one another. We have reached the point in which the basic function of family and community has been largely forgotten.\nThere are many systematic problems within society which can directly explain the decline in family ties. Let’s just take one; the family home. If there’s going to be one place in which instincts of mutual support are to thrive it is within the home. A study from 2013/14 suggest that only 6.81% of people live in a multigenerational household. There are many explanations for why this is the case, however what should be clear is that such a reality stands in the way of any serious attempt to solve the social care crisis.\nBefore trying to address this societal decay we must first establish a clear alternative to individualism, an alternative which offers a radically different vision for society, one that reawakens and reimagines the traditional institutions of family and community. Evidently, this is a conversation which is missing from both British politics and the debate over social care.\nThe Tories being caring they’re up to something take anything Johnson says with a pinch of salt\nI suspect the national conversation has been missing because it opens up a huge can of political and philosophical worms. And any attempt at a cultural solution to the social care crisis is also coming long after that particular cultural horse has bolted.\nI broadly agree with the points you are making, but how do we even begin to turn around the tide and at least six decades of dogma promoted by our education system, government, advertising and the mass media? Liberal Individualism pervades all of society and dominates the thinking of all mainstream parties of left and right. Of course such individualism, except at its extremes, has always been framed by politicians as the highest personal good. Whether it is left-wing ‘rights’ based individualism or right-wing ‘economic’ individualism, all forms of individualism appeal to our desire for autonomy and freedom from onerous burdens a.k.a. our vanity and our self interest. And now suddenly, when our secular national religion turns out to be financially and socially unsustainable some brave person wants to announce we were duty bound to look after our infirm relatives the whole time? Good luck with that campaign.\nAs the left will be quick to point out, almost the whole burden of caring for the elderly and infirm has historically fallen on women. Short of some massive change in the social status of carers (and indeed of housewives and motherhood) along with appropriate financial recognition, any call for a return to family based care will be portrayed as an attempt to take women out of the work place and back into ‘traditional roles’ i.e. as seriously regressive and misogynist.\nPerhaps such a counter attack can be foiled, but we should also be concerned about the other political risks of pushing a ‘pro-family’ and ‘back to basics’ style agenda, however worthy and righteous the cause. It’s not that the message does not resonate with many people, but the messenger and their party becomes a hostage to fortune. The personal life of individuals pushing such an agenda would come under minute scrutiny for any hint of hypocrisy. Indeed the practical political problem could be stated thus:- when trying to start a conversation that in essence is about personal morality, only he or she who is sure they are without sin should cast around such policy proposals.\nI think there should be more incentives for families to take in and care for their elderly relatives. Transferable tax allowance would be one option. Too many elderly people live unwillingly alone but hate the prospect of being in an elderly care home.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_britain-needs-protectionism-not-free-trade/content_412.html": "Trade protectionism is legitimate and can be effective.\nI’ll explain why.\nFirst, international trade is desirable and necessary. And it boosts global welfare. However, it’s a mistake to advocate total free trade at all times and in all places. Why? Because at certain times, certain forms of industrial protectionism are beneficial to certain nations. Remember economic history. The United States developed its manufacturing behind a tariff wall. South Korea did the same. The point is, all nation states practise forms of protectionism from time to time, often for very good reasons.\nSecondly, my advocacy of some trade protection is not ideological. It’s based on national interest. If a system of totally free imports were good for the country, I’d support it. The point is, right now, it isn’t and I don’t. By the way, politically this is nothing new. It was the position of my favourite Edwardian Tory – F. E. Smith, who argued, quote:\n“It is a waste of time to consider where we stand as between Free Trade and Protection. We are offered no such choice. We must choose between protection and one-sided free imports. Confronted with such alternatives. If this indeed be the choice, I am a protectionist.”\nThird – the key point and the overriding point. We must face the fact that Britain has a massive trade problem and it’s making us poorer. We run large trade deficits year after year. Now, some economic liberals think it doesn’t matter. This is completely wrong. Remember, we can pay for imports in 3 ways… by exporting things, by selling assets, or by issuing debt. Running a big trade deficit means selling assets and raising debt. This isn’t a theory – it’s just mathematics. If you think this doesn’t matter, you’re putting flow above stock, consumption over wealth. As someone once said, debt-fulled consumption is not prosperity. It’s like selling your house to buy beer. Beer is good but you shouldn’t put it on the capital account.\nMy key point is… you are not going to correct your trade gap by continuing the trade and industrial policies which got you into it. As an aside, I think the cause of the trade gap is partly cultural. It’s the indifference of our ruling class to what is made where and by whom and indifference to who owns what. Our ruling class is ideologically attached to free trade – whatever the consequences. Even if it implies foreign ownership of our key industries or vassalage to the United States. It doesn’t seem to matter.\nFourth, cheap goods are more costly than you think. For 40 years we’ve run an experiment in light or tariff-free imports. The result is de-industrialisation, production off-shored to China. Manufacturing as a percentage of UK GDP has fallen from 30% in 1980 to about 9% now. The effect of this on the Midlands and the post-industrial North has been huge. Sheffield used to have 70,000 steelworkers. It now has 70,000 students. A local economy based on production has been replaced with one based on debt. The industrial wage – once the foundation of the family – has been destroyed. And when the factories close, the drug dealers move in. And as the benefits bill ramps up, the state borrows money to mop up the blood. Yes, you’ve got the cheap goods and the consumer is better off in the short term. But if the town loses its industry, you’ll end up with no consumers either – just beggary.\nFifth, I concede that free trade produces cheaper goods. It does. But is it right to prioritise price over all other things at all times? It’s the Sergeant Wilson question – Is that terribly wise? What about security? How safe is our supply of food, energy and military hardware? If the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis teach us anything at all it should be that sometimes security trumps price. I think German industrialists who have lost their cheap Russia gas may agree on this point.\nSixth, a great deal of ‘free trade’ is not fair trade. We face mercantilism and non-tariff barriers but we also buy goods produced using modern slavery. Should British workers compete with pittance wages/slave labour? I think not, and I think we’re far too indifferent to this. So… should we ban imports produced by slavery? Yes. Is that also a form of protectionism? Yes. Is this point unarguable? Yes.\nTo finish, our current system of international trade has created huge economic imbalances which need correcting. I’m not advocating bone-headed trade wars, autarky or a ‘Bennite’ siege economy. I am asking for greater freedom to re-industrialise, to protect strategically important sectors, for nation states to make some of their own social and economic bargains. And they should do so without being fettered by unelected supranational committees. After all, this is why many of us on the economic left voted to leave the EU. Thankfully, we’re seeing a paradigm shift away from the global towards the local. And for the first time in 40 years, protectionism is now a legitimate political choice. Good. Not before time.",

Issued on January 25th 1981 by the prominent Labour politicians Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rogers and Shirley Williams, the Limehouse Declaration signalled the group’s intent to leave the Labour party and found their own political movement. To this day, the Limehouse Declaration remains the most significant challenge to two-party duopoly in British political history.\nIn 2018 the SDP built upon the ideals of Limehouse with the New Declaration, which called for a stronger and more capable state along with greater individual responsibility, trust and social solidarity. Today, the SDP occupies a unique place in British politics, with an ethos informed by patriotism, left-leaning economics and cultural traditionalism.\nWith the SDP now approaching its 40th anniversary, the revived and enduring party looks forward to continuing the original goal of the Limehouse Declaration – the renewal of British politics and society.\nSDP leader William Clouston says:\n“The SDP is very proud to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Limehouse Declaration. It’s an important day not just for thousands of SDP members throughout the country but for all British citizens. The British people know they’re not well governed by Conservative and Labour parties, which seem increasingly out of touch and devoid of ideas.\n“The case for fundamental political reform remains as cogent today as it was 40 years ago. As the speed of the SDP’s recent resurgence demonstrates, people are crying out for a sensible party – one that rejects divisive politics, believes in the British people and actually governs in the national interest.”",

Henry served in the Royal Hussars and subsequently in the Territorial Army, rising to the rank of Captain, and later joined Thames Valley Police where he was awarded an award for outstanding bravery. He was a District Administrator in Kosovo, Director of Field Operations for the international ceasefire operations in Macedonia, and Senior Adviser to the Secretary General of the world’s largest inter-governmental security organisation, the OSCE. Henry subsequently led joint UK/US civil/military teams for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Afghanistan, and headed the European Union’s crisis response team in Ukraine. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2013 for services to international security.\nHenry Bolton comments:\n“Our country desperately needs a political party that places the interests of the United Kingdom and the British people first, understands that government has to provide the infrastructure and services to empower a vibrant economy and society; a party that refuses to sell our strategic assets to foreign interests and, above all, a party of integrity and honesty, that practices democracy, is interested in the details so crucial to success in delivering what is promised; a party that is robust on immigration and borders; a party that we can trust because it works for the greater good, not just its own.\nWell, we do have such a party… and so I’m very pleased to have joined the SDP. I shall do all I can to support William, his team and the party’s candidates to get to where they are needed i.e. in elected office around the country, including Westminster.”\nSDP Chair Stephen Balogh comments: “As the SDP continues to grow in profile and stature, so we are seeing many with deep expertise and experience choosing to join our party, whether they are culturally conservative or on the traditional left. Henry Bolton receives a warm welcome from us all.”\nSDP Leader William Clouston comments: “We are delighted to have Henry Bolton on board. Henry brings with him a wealth of experience in the fields of defence, diplomacy and foreign affairs. And in an increasingly unstable world, Britain’s security is paramount. Henry’s expertise will be invaluable to the SDP and I look forward to working with him in developing robust policy aimed at protecting our nation and its people.”",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_policies_taxation/content_184.html": "Taxation\nA substantial tax base is the foundation of a strong and capable state. Taxation should be as simple and understandable as possible, easy to collect and hard to avoid. However, state expenditure should broadly match tax and other revenues across the economic cycle, with borrowing used only to fund investment anticipated to yield value greater than its cost. The secular growth in government debt as a percentage of GDP will be reversed via a combination of adequate taxes raised and general prudence in state expenditure.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- The new OECD regime ensuring minimum rates of taxation on large global enterprises, coming into effect in January 2024, will be implemented as a priority.\n- Until the above OECD global accord comes into full effect, companies with a global turnover of greater than £10m and operating in the UK will pay a Turnover Tax proportionate to UK sales (calculated as 20% of the company’s declared global EBIT profit).\n- The annual allowance will be restoredat all income levels, the non-domicile rule will be abolished and the corporate tax rate for SMEs will be cut to 15%. Stamp duty will be abolished on all residential land transfers below £500k, but applied at 10% on any portion above that level.\n- Any residential property unoccupied for more than 183 days per annum will be subject to a vacant residential property tax levied at 1% of the property’s capital value, with all revenues from this levy flowing to the local council.\n- Where a bequest is left to a direct family member, inheritance tax thresholds will be applied to each beneficiary of the estate, not the estate overall. Each child may therefore inherit £325,000 tax free. Spousal legacies will continue to be free of inheritance tax.\n- A tax of 2% will be levied on all online purchases and the proceeds used to fund civic improvement in town centres across the UK.\n- Pension contributions will be deductible at the basic rate of tax, not higher rates of tax as at present.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_policies_governance-of-national-enterprises/content_401.html": "Governance of National Enterprises\nNatural monopolies will be brought under government ownership and operated on commercial principles aligned with the service ethic. It is vital that all nationalised enterprises embody an ethos of duty to the nation and service to the citizen. We must learn the lessons of the 1970s, and ensure that these do not become insulated and uncompetitive entities managed more in the interests of management and employees than the British people.\nPOLICY PLEDGES:\n- An audit of key operational and strategic metrics against British and international comparators will be conducted every three years by an independent review body.\n- A business plan will be prepared annually by management and agreed by the relevant government department and Treasury officials.\n- At least three quarters of the board members of a national enterprise will have significant experience in the industry concerned. No board member may serve for more than 7 years, have any financial interest in a commercial enterprise connected with the national enterprise, or be a former minister.\n- All executive appointments will be made by a committee of the Board and a Secretary of State for the area concerned.\n- The Chief Executive of the national enterprise will be paid at global market rates with at least 50% of remuneration being contingent upon performance targets including customer satisfaction, project delivery and cost/efficiency benchmarks.\n- National enterprises will fund their own capital investment from operating cash flow or via loans from the Treasury at the government borrowing rate + 1%.\n- Employment terms and conditions (including pay, pensions, and employment security) in nationalised industries will be benchmarked to comparable roles in the private sector. This benchmark will be reviewed regularly by an ombudsman, and all employees will be appraised annually against high standards of customer service. Non-performing employees will be dismissed.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_labour-will-miss-the-ai-revolution/content_99.html": "AI will be transformative – providing the government’s approach is the right one. Fat hope of that, says JAMES McNEILL, the SDP’s 2024 general electrion candidate for Calder Valley.\nKeir Starmer recently unveiled Labour’s AI strategy, based on the government’s response to the AI Opportunities Action Plan. Labour’s strategy is reminiscent of Ireland’s Celtic Tiger co-operation between government, business and education, which successfully kickstarted Ireland’s software industry and placed Ireland as the favoured European location for international investment in software development. Will Labour manage to pull off the same trick? Unfortunately, their built-in attitudes are likely to sabotage their own strategy for several reasons\nThe Social Market\nThe strategy recognises that success will depend on successful co-operation between government, business and education, in a manner that will be familiar to SDP members from our Social Market perspective. The document mentions public-private partnerships throughout. Although Labour will hopefully avoid the larcenous excesses of the Conservatives (particularly with the PPE scandal), its own history of saddling the NHS with disastrous PFI contracts under Gordon Brown, and its anti-business budget since returning to power, leave little to inspire optimism.\nRegional Investment and Development\nLabour has launched no significant initiatives to address regional inequalities in investment and development since coming to power in July 2024, and their AI strategy continues in the same vein. The only locations mentioned outside the south of England are pre-existing projects in Liverpool, where Kyndryl Holdings were already planning a hub; Wales, where Vantage Data Centres were already planned to allocate funds for some data sites; and Edinburgh University, where it is planned to extend the Archer2 resource, but only till 2026. It is probable that Labour will be even worse for the regions than the Conservatives, whose fig leaf attempts when they remembered they had a Levelling Up policy were more embarrassing than effective.\nThere seems to be no chance of this Labour administration taking a determined approach to dealing with the structural damage that has been inflicted on the UK by subsidising the South East to the detriment of the rest of the country. Primary industrial development like AI requires regional clusters of human skill and compute power, for example Glasgow-Edinburgh-Newcastle, Manchester-Leeds-Sheffield or the Birmingham conurbation, not random investments peppered across the country.\nRecruitment\nAnd it gets worse. The dead hand of The Blob is evident in the commitment to “drive greater diversity across the AI talent pool”. This is exactly what happened with the Conservatives’ dismal National Cyber Security Council, when civil service careerists got their way and insisted, with no empirical evidence, that the nation’s information resources were best protected by making sure that cyber specialists were hired depending on their sex or their ethnicity, rather than on their ability to do the job.\nIt is not the responsibility of commerce or public services to counterbalance the asymmetric take-up of STEM studies in education by discriminating against the people who have developed their skills to be the best in the job market. This will only deliver sub-optimal services and products in a hyper competitive arena, and will not give Britain a global lead in anything, let alone AI.\nTheir strategy is also to recruit from abroad. While it would be sensible to tempt world leaders in AI to Britain, Labour has a history of hiring foreign talent at the expense of the UK workforce, and its domestic plan is just to upskill the workforce and teach young people. Doubtless we need to teach people what is possible with the datasets available, how to frame questions to AI (“prompt engineering”), and how to evaluate the results, but this will not make us world leaders in AI. If you want a career in AI, start by studying for an appropriate degree. The strategy makes the same mistake as the National Cyber Security Council’s keenness for apprenticeships and for the same reason: the mandarins fail to understand that cybersecurity and AI are engineering disciplines and need people who have relevant qualifications and experience. We should be cross-training from other IT areas and reaching out to expatriates to persuade them to come home, rejoin their families and communities, and bring their children up in their own culture.\nPrivacy and Regulation\nFinally, the strategy appreciates that Britain is in a sweet spot with regards to privacy and regulation. The EU has actually created a decent piece of legislation in the EU AI Act, with the intention of not repeating the mistakes of the GDPR and leaning too heavily to abstract individual legal rights at the expense of our access to services and products. However, being the EU they have no chance of facing down the individual states and regions all desperate to be seen to be the foremost in standing up to Big AI. Max Schrems is going to have a field day.\nIn the US, the tech giants have all drawn up “Responsible AI” guidelines, to keep their own regulators off their backs and to sell into the European market. Their history with the EU means that is liable to face severe roadblocks, and in an ideal world Britain could take the lead with Privacy rules approved by the EU and government datasets managed and shared with business in a pragmatic and transparent manner.\nHowever, given that many Labour stalwarts cut their eye teeth with Grievance Lawyers 4 U, it is far more likely that they will spend their time sniping and cavilling at successful businesses until they decide to relocate to a more profitable environment. This on top of Labour’s tendency to put jobsworths in place to trip up and delay innovation means that any regulatory advantage we might have had is likely to fall at the first fence.\nI very much wish these things were not the case. Britain’s ingenuity, democracy and hard graft launched the first industrial revolution, and we are in a unique position to benefit from the Industry 4.0 of AI. The AI Opportunities Action Plan has many good proposals, well-judged to give Britain a lead at a critical juncture. Yet Labour’s default settings are likely to ensure their AI strategy comes to naught:\nThey fail to comprehend the Social Market.\nTheir centralist command and control mindset will not utilize skills across the country.\nThey will force second-raters onto British firms, in an intensely competitive global marketplace.\nTheir failure to understand that AI is an engineering discipline means that precious time will be squandered in mentoring and apprenticeships of dubious merit.\nThey will put immigration above education in building the workforce.\nAmbulance chasing court cases, and bureaucratic checks and delays on innovative business, will be the death knell for any chance we may have had for benefiting from our datasets and legislative environment.\nWe could have been in with a chance, but not with this government.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_lord-david-owen-a-life-in-politics/content_260.html": "The SDP’s Social Market – Slogan or System?\nThank you. It’s a real pleasure to be here today.\n‘Our big idea. Our very own idea. If we work it out further we could make it our flagship’. That was David Owen in 1988 describing The Social Market economy – an idea which was a feature of SDP thinking throughout the 1980s. Owenites claimed the Social Market as their foundational system, others flirted with it, and many ordinary SDP members felt… ‘If we only knew what it was, we’d be bound to endorse it…’\nSo what was the Social Market? Was it a genuinely new and distinctive system of political economy? Or was it just a useful rhetorical device which helped the SDP define itself?\nFirst, its origins. The phrase ‘Social Market’ was originally used in Germany in 1946 by Alfred Muller-Armack – a member of the Frieburg School of ordo-liberal economists. His formulation was more market than social. But importantly, it later fed into the CDU’s political programme which contained pro-competition and strong anti-trust laws against monopoly power. This is a consistent feature of all forms of ‘Social Market’ theory. Policy resembling the Social Market was adopted by the West German SPD after it abandoned Marxism in 1959 – although the term itself was not used by them at that stage.\nFast forward to Britain in 1975 and the term crops up in Keith Joseph’s CPS paper ‘Britain Needs a Social Market’. But, again, Joseph’s formulation contained a lot of market but relatively little of the social dimension – save for what economic surpluses of the market itself would provide.\nGo forward to 1981 and you start to see the evolution of the Social Market concept within the SDP. It’s worth noting that the term appears neither in the ‘Limehouse Declaration’ nor in the SDP’s initial 12 point plan after its launch. The mixed econony was mentioned. The word decentralisation appears. However, in May 1981 David Owen presented a lecture at Strathclyde University titled ‘The Social Market’. This contained the seeds but it wasn’t until David became leader of the SDP that the Social Market – as we understand it today – was firmly introduced to the British people.\nSo what was it? Well, quote, ‘The social market is itself a vague phrase, though with powerful resonances.’ That’s Robert Skidelsky. The foundational point I think, is the one that David Owen makes in his 1984 book ‘A Future That Will Work’, namely, that the Social Market is not merely the mixed economy. Key point. An adherent of Labour’s Clause 4 could advocate the mixed economy but without any real enthusiasm for the profit motive of the private sector. Similarly, a free enterprise purist could endorse the mixed economy but without really valuing the central role that government plays in any successful state.\nIn contrast, advocates of the Social Market understood that the private and public sectors depend on each other and that the frontiers between them must be respected. Another key point. Why? Because the motive force, as David Owen called it, of each sector is different. ‘Profits are the motive force of the private sector, Service is the motive force of the public sector.’ To favour one sector against the other risks harming both.\nDid the concept of the Social Market – as the SDP promoted it – change over the years? Yes it did and again, I’d argue, more on the social side than the market side. It evolved.\nThe post-election 1983 version was a combination of dynamic free markets with widespread government intervention. There were definite signs, I think, of the SDP’s Labour heritage here. A strong and active state would preside over competition policy but it would also conduct industrial policy, skills training, have an incomes policy, engage in economic planning and wealth redistribution.\nLater formulations of the SDP’s Social Market policy would shift away from state planning and intervention towards redistribution as a means of tackling inequality and into franchising as a means of running some services. Decentralisation remained an important component of Owenite thinking as was industrial democracy and trade union reform.\nIntriguingly – despite being championed by David Owen and the SDP – the term Social Market does not appear in the 1987 Alliance Manifesto. Question… was the sharpness of the SDP’s Social Market message blunted by the Liberals? Possibly. At any event, post-1987 the concept refused to die and came roaring back at the 1988 SDP Conference, where Robert Skidelsky’s Green Paper on the topic was published which, by the way, clarifies a firm limit to the market in the case of natural monopolies. I’ll return to this.\nFor 1980s Britain – as in post-war Germany – in all species of Social Market theory the market component of the equation remained stable. The belief is constant – that competitive markets foster creativity, innovation and efficient production with the state tackling monopoly power. The means to achieve social aims – like reducing poverty or inequality – were more varied. Sometimes this was defining strong boundaries to the state’s domain, sometimes it was planning, sometimes redistribution.\nSo was the SDP’s Social Market merely a political tool? A slogan? A ploy? Well, there’s no doubt that concept was very useful in sharpening the SDP’s political identity and its general appeal. The phrase, in retail British politics, was new – introduced by David Owen. And I was useful. The word ‘social’ distiguished the SDP from the harshness of the Thatcherite new right. The term ‘market’ differentiated the party from the anti-market hard left. It was, in that sense, ideal. It had reach on both sides of the traditional left/right political divide.\nThe public facing message – Tough and Tender – was clear enough to explain and to understand. However, it’s fair to say that the Social Market concept landed more within the academic, journalistic and political classes than it did the general British voter. Was it ever ‘cashed out’ into votes? Probably not. Since it was never in a 1980s general election manifesto it’s difficult to se how it could have been. And if some SDP members struggled to understand it voters probably had similar difficulties.\nSo was the Social Market a political tool? Yes, I think it was. Does that mean it wasn’t a distinctive and coherent political system in itself? Not at all.\nAs might be expected, its critics were not persuaded. To the Liberal grandee Malcolm Bruce, quote: ‘Social Market economics seemed to me to be no different from liberal economic pragmatism’. SDP biographers Crewe and King opined: “The notion that capitalism could be combined with redistribution and the welfare state was not new… elements of it can be traced back to Ian Macleod’s One Nation Conservatism and Tony Crosland’s revisionist socialism.” I have to say, I think Crewe and King get this wrong – which is curious, particularly when you write a book with over a third of a million words in it. In confusing it with High Toryism or the simply the mixed economy they totally misunderstand what the Social Market actually was.\nThe sagacity of David Owen’s Social Market ideas are proved, I think, in retrospect. In the counterfactual. We’d have been better off had they been adopted. I’ll give you three examples.\nFirst, housing. The housing crisis of today has been decades in the making and has one primary cause, namely, the deliberate destruction of state sector house building capacity. Both the ’83 and ’87 Alliance manifestos proposed a large expansion of state house building programmes. This didn’t happen. Instead, council house completions in the 80s collapsed under the Tories and New Labour killed the sector off altogether. My point is, our most serious domestic macroeconomic problem wouldn’t exist at the scale it does today if a Social Market approach had been adopted. Why? Because the state would’ve built some houses.\nSecond, utilities. The experiment in privatising our water industry has been a disastrous failure. We’ve ended up with a foreign-owned, poorly regulated industry characterised by low investment, profits siphoned off abroad with the companies themselves being used as debt mules by the banks. A frontiers variant of the Social Market – which grasps that natural monopolies, as Skidelsky recognised, can’t be marketised – would have avoided all of this.\nThird, industrial policy. David consistently opposed the overnight and brutal de-industralisation of the Thatcher years proposing, instead, an industrial policy with phased economic adjustments cushioned – in his words – by government intervention. Alas, we all know what happened. Factories closed, drug dealers moved in and family life – whose very foundation was the industrial wage – has never recovered. Whatever gains the new right imagined they’d get via this ‘creative destruction’ have been more than outweighed by the social consequences and in particular, the emergence of a jobless underclass. Neoliberalism has been self-defeating. As John Gray wrote in last week’s New Statesman, ‘The combination of unfettered markets with “traditional values” imagined by latter-day disciples of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan is utopian fantasy.’\nTrue. We could have done with an industrial policy.\nAfter 1990 Social Market ideas lived on in the former social democrats – Danny Finkelstein, Greg Clark and others – who, like Lucretian atoms, made new alliances with other parties. And to this day its core concepts are still promoted by the Social Market Foundation and the resurgent SDP.\nSo, to conclude. The SDP’s Social Market – Slogan or System? I think both. The term served as a neat parable of what the SDP was about and enabled it to carve out a distinctive identity which could reach across the political divide. The Social Market also gave an intellectual underpinning to the SDP – a prerequisite to any serious political movement. There’s no doubt that the Social Market was and remains a coherent system of political economy. In the 80s many of its critics failed to recognise two things. First, its revolutionary nature, and secondly, its fit with David Owen’s own anti-establishment streak. The fact is, Social Market ran totally contra to the interest-based politics of the day. That was the difference. That made it subversive.\nThe great pity is that while these ideas took hold in Singapore – arguably the Social Market’s favourite child – its precepts have never been fully applied in Britain. Perhaps there’s still time…\nFascinating and informative. I was disappointed not to be able to attend this great event.\nI was interested to read this article, comment below:\n“…….A frontiers variant of the Social Market – which grasps that natural monopolies, ……….. can’t be marketised – would have avoided all of this….”\nThis quote gives good insight into just what the term “social market” means, viz: some crucial utilities which form the foundation of everyday life and which facilitate the effective functioning of communities within the entire nation, need protecting from the cut and thrust of raw markets; I think phone and internet should be one of these utilities under public control.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_country-matters-manifesto-political-malaise-tradition-scruton/content_368.html": "The stacking of the rendering pot that reflects the tired ideals of legacy politics in the UK is well underway, awaiting a final nudge to the full heat of a General Election. That pot will boil and spit toward some form of weary electoral conclusion no doubt, as the First Past the Post system aims to punt at another set of forlorn fixes to our current economic, societal and political malaise.\nSame-old, then? But no — for the British countryside it is more critical this time round. For those who live in the countryside; those who work in the countryside; those who cherish it as home; or who simply love what it is, the political stakes for the future have never been higher. Quite simply, the next election heralds an existential reckoning for the British countryside.\nAs appears to be their want, as inexplicable as it is foolishly complacent, the Conservatives will wake to the challenge of the countryside vote – in 2019 their vote, winning 89% of all rural seats – overly late. No amount of warning will stir them from their torpor now: the countryside is lost to the Conservatives; its rural standing wounded, weakened and diminished.\nFor Labour, it cleverly tacks to a charted plan, a decade-long in the making, to seduce rural constituencies – the Tories’ very own ‘Rural Wall’ – to a position of strategic capture. This has moved Keir Starmer to a full-blown love-in with the National Farmers’ Union (NFU): at the NFU’s recent conference in Birmingham, Labour promised farmers “a new relationship with the countryside.”\nIn a foreword to Ed Rowlandson’s ‘The Elephant in the Countryside – Labour’s Rural Problem’ (2020), Labour peer Baroness Anne Mallalieu is succinct, wielding a stiletto-sharp point: “No party can afford to ignore the rural vote if it is serious about forming a government.” Labour now doubles down on strategy first proffered by Maria Eagle MP in a seminal report, ‘Labour’s Rural Problem’ in 2015. Not to labour a point, but — Labour needs the countryside…\nThe problem for Sir Keir, despite assurances that he represents now “a changed party from top to bottom”, is that the countryside has a memory. That memory, sufficient and deep, recalls yet viscerally the worst excesses of a previous Labour administration. It too attached to itself the identity and hope of the new only in time, to succumb, predictably, to the same prejudices and spite of the old. The loss to the countryside is still being borne today.\nFor party political machines attention is most acutely focused toward the urban. Cities and larger towns have the frenzy of modern political progressiveness about them: constituency-dense, campaign-efficient, tradition-lite, culturally-plastic; inclined to a potency of shifting opinion and electoral-swing. The countryside in contrast is none of this: the politics of the countryside is different: hard to move, slow to gain, sceptical of change.\nIt is precisely because a minority countryside sits as an aside from the majority urban that the countryside is impacted so greatly; little more than the mere dumb hostage to the vicissitudes, mechanisms and machinations of the body-politic and its hard-wired urban bias. The countryside has things done to it, imposed upon it, rather than with it and for it.\nThe countryside needs a direction; a future of its own making: A Countryside Manifesto. And not merely a broad policy brush, an unworkable mush of jargon, that amounts to nothing more substantive than a public relations exercise. A Countryside Manifesto would not simply pay lip-service to ‘environment’, to ‘habitat’, to ‘wildlife’, to ‘agriculture’, to ‘diversification’, to ‘recreation’, etc. It would frame once and for all the most important element of all in the countryside: its ‘people’.\nIt must be recognised that within the culture of the countryside, within local knowledge and skills, rests the key to achieving the aims of a Countryside Manifesto. Traditional and time-honoured practices would be acknowledged as principal policy drivers as, in the considered words of Roger Scruton in his book ‘Green Philosophy’ (2012), these are not “mere arbitrary rules and conventions”, but in fact “answers that have been discovered to enduring questions”.\nAwareness, recognition, values, renewal, education and training would be core themes of a Countryside Manifesto. To that end, the significance and prominence of county-based agricultural/land-based colleges would be vigorously re-established. Established once as critical rural institutions under the 1947 Agriculture Act and attracting respect and a collective reputation for excellence throughout the world, since 1997 this unique and proudly specialist sector has been deliberately gutted.\nRe-invigorated, agricultural/land-based colleges would embrace a new role as county/region-focused rural development hubs: locating relevant business and investment expertise at the very heart of the rural communities they intend to serve. Banks and other funding institutions would campaign and bid for on-campus presence at each of the colleges. Operational independence, once a proud and respected feature of this highly influential land-orientated training sector, would be restored again in full measure.\nFood security, biodiversity and sustainable land management together now mean more to the nation than, arguably, ever before. Yet with the politically inspired demise of the county agricultural/land-based college over the last three decades there is barely anyone left capable of evolving and teaching the practical skills, nurturing and extending the specialist managerial talent necessary to built and prepare the countryside for the future. The agricultural/land-based college system must be saved.\nA trend aimed at restricting agriculture slowly gains momentum throughout Europe. Much of this can be associated with, at the very least, debatable environmental policy; some of it, at the most extreme, an arguably plausible agenda to nationalise land and drive people from it. If history has taught anything, it is the often-deep association national populations have with land. This is becoming, certainly across the European Union, a recipe for protest and organised political activity.\nThe rise of the of the farmers’ protest movement in the Netherland is a case in point. The Farmer-Citizen Movement (BoerBurgerBeweging – BBB) was formed in protest to Dutch government policy to reduce nitrogen pollution on farms by forcing thousands of farmers from their land. With a surge in popular support, the BBB won around 20% of the vote for the Dutch Senate in March of this year. “Nobody can ignore us any longer,” said BBB leader Caroline van der Plas. “Voters have spoken out very clearly.”\nIn the UK context, it is the heedless rush to the political grail of ‘Net Zero’ that drives both our main parties, Conservative and Labour alike. Re-assurance is important to any farming business, indeed to all forms of land management. Without it doubt and hopelessness take hold.\nConfidence is currently being bled from British farming, and although several reasons can be cited for this, the prospect of Net Zero is the most significant. For example, a combination of livestock restriction, on-shore wind power development and carbon-off-setting by tree-planting, both subsidy-lucrative, could well end traditional upland farming in the UK forever – along with the families and communities who call those places home.\nThe Countryside needs a voice. The countryside needs a leader who can put a meaningful Countryside Manifesto together and who may champion the kind of message that the people of the countryside and their supporters can stand full-square behind. The politics of the countryside is different. That must be completely understood and appreciated in all its colour, shade, nuance, texture and complexity.\nThe countryside can actively rise. The countryside can politically engage. If the countryside is to retain its identity – its culture, traditions, liberty and values – it must succeed in both. The Conservatives have forgotten what the countryside is; taking its vote for granted. Labour works to a plan; if the plan prevails, the elite progressives in its metropolitan strongholds and the vengeful Left who do not leave old inclinations so lightly will have their way: Labour will fail the countryside.\nWithin the excellence of his thinking, Sir Roger Scruton invokes the theories of Edmund Burke (1729-1797) in attempting to explain how the countryside is. He writes of “the little platoons”, suggesting that in families, associations and gatherings, in long-shared interests, lay the foundation of social cultural traditions built on “affection and loyalty”. To Burke, Scruton tells us, traditions are “forms of knowledge” the “inherited solutions to problems that we all encounter”.\n“Social tradition exists because they enable a society to reproduce itself,” offers Scruton. That is why tradition is so important in the countryside: tradition is required in order to exist. “Destroy them heedlessly,” Scruton warns, “and you remove the guarantee offered by one generation to the next”. To the countryside, passing on values to a future and the meaning attached to the past counts for everything.\nPay attention to the little platoons, understand them, offer them fair claim to a future, then you just might find you have an army prepared to march again, and this time one fully prepared to vote.\nI live in a rural area I do not know anyone who likes Starmer’s Labour nor do I know anyone who with a brain would contemplate voting Labour the Conservatives are a disaster though I see Sunak remaining in office with a much smaller majority the sdp is the alternative Government not Labour\nQute right Adam. I think the SDP has clear policies that appeal to rural votes, based on family, community and nation. Labour’s main electoral base will always be urban, and it is focused on gearing its policies to the urban voter. The party that seems to get the rural vote are the Liberal Democrats but in my opinion they stand for nothing – neither Tory, nor Labour and without any innovate policies or concerned with preserving the nation’s culture.\nSo, the job of the SDP is really to communicate what it can do or rural constituencies in order to attract their support and to outline the areas that differentiate the party from the Conservatives and Labour.\nThe countryside has in large part become a playground; an outdoor pursuits area for holidaymakers, second home owners and wealthy retired. We need to make it affordable for ordinary families to stay living there and to create more land based jobs.",

We call for the government to enact strict travel bans against affected nations, while ruling out any renewal of domestic restrictions.\nTo protect Britain’s national recovery from the pandemic, we support the introduction of travel bans to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe. We also support more rigorous testing and quarantine procedures for all new arrivals into Britain, to prevent the importing of new cases from continental Europe or any other location.\nSDP leader William Clouston says: “Given the relatively low lethality of COVID-19 among our largely vaccinated population, imposing new restrictions in light of this variant would be both unnecessary and disproportionate. Let’s maintain the vaccine booster rollout while keeping all schools, shops and places of work open. The social and economic damage of any new set of restrictions would far outweigh any benefit gained.”",

I spent countless hours in police stations interviewing illegal entrants – they came in the backs of lorries then – before ordering up the taxi to take them off to whatever accommodation was arranged for them.\nI wasn’t allowed to detain them, even the most blatant liars – the likes of those self-proclaimed ‘Palestinians’ who didn’t have a clue about Palestine. Many was the time I wondered whether I was releasing another potential criminal into the community. Since retirement I have found the ongoing saga of immigration horror stories, and the inept responses of politicians, utterly depressing.\nI was therefore agreeably surprised to read the SDP statement of immigration policy, which pretty much accords with the conclusions I have reached in the last few years: the Human Rights Act has been a disaster for the administration of immigration policy, so now may be the time to get rid of it.\nWhen I worked at Heathrow in the early 1990s, what I have come to think of as the Great Asylum Scam was already under way, and the Home Office was unprepared for it. The complacency throughout the organisation was well illustrated by the Chief Immigration Officer, who, when I expressed concern at the growing number of cases, leaned back on this chair and told me that “it’s just the latest ploy – we’ve had MP’s representations, we’ve had Judicial Review. We’ve seen them off, we’ll see this off as well”. Meanwhile the piles of files in the back office grew daily, at that time mainly Zaireans (now Democratic Republic of Congo), proffering the flimsiest of stories for seeking asylum, supported by immigration advisors on whose probity and competence I perhaps should not comment.\nYear after year the cases mounted up, defying all attempts to resolve them, each bout of new legislation serving only to enrich those immigration lawyers. Now “seeking asylum” appears to have become synonymous with “seeking a better life”, and most politicians and the mainstream media seem unwilling to challenge any hard-luck story or the notion that claims of hardship are sufficient reason to migrate to whichever country you choose.\nTherefore it is, I feel, now entirely justified for the United Kingdom (or any Western country) to abolutely remove the illusion that gaining entry by whatever means and gaming the asylum system is going to be successful. Harsh that may be, but ultimately it would be much fairer to dissuade people from making the journey in the first place.\nThere are, after all, millions of refugees in the world, and while we should certainly help some, we can’t help all. What right have those who force their way in illegally to claim priority? The UK can fulfill its humanitarian obligations by accepting a quota of people whose identity and nationality is not in doubt (a very important requirement), and who are certified by the United Nations as being in need of international protection – and priority to be given to families, father mother and children, rather than the single young males who comprise the bulk of those who claim to need the UK’s help.\nNo need to consider asylum claims, no backlog, no appeals, no lawyers’ gravy train – all that would be gone, as those who come would already be accepted as refugees. They could be welcomed with every assistance, found jobs, housing and schools. Of course, there would always be arguments about the quota, which of necessity could only be small while the backlog is cleared, either by removing those unqualified to stay, or by an amnesty. However, no amnesty should even be considered unless the border is strictly enforced.\nI’m sorry to say this, but the boats will continue to come until a rigorous regime of detention and swift removal is in place. Cries of “just send them back” ignore the logistical and legal obstacles to doing that. Simply forcing small boats in mid-channel to turn back is dangerous and arguably illegal, and long-standing International Conventions don’t oblige the French to accept the return of any travellers who left their shores unless they did so by scheduled services. Once they arrive on UK shores or are picked up in UK waters they are the UK’s problem.\nAnyone refused entry to the UK at a port or airport can be removed either to the country of which they are a national or to the place where they embarked on a scheduled service. In the latter case, if they have no valid travel document, that is a problem for the authorities where they embarked. Overstayers or illegal entrants can be removed to their own country if they have a passport or one can be obtained for them.\nThe problem arises where the offender has no document and there is no easy means of verifying their identity, which I suspect is the case with most of the rubber dinghy arrivals – it certainly was with those who came in the backs of lorries in my day. There are many countries who decline to take their nationals back without a travel document and then refuse to issue one because they say the individual can not be identified.\nThe Home Office, as I discovered, has for a long time been utterly supine in accepting this from far too many countries. For example, Vietnamese is a unique language, spoken by no other nationality – so why, I ask, is it acceptable for the authorities there to insist on an exact identity for one of theirs? They could sort that out when he/she is back on native soil.\nRemember the Morecambe Bay tragedy? I remember grinding my teeth as I watched the Immigration Minister on television offering mealy-mouthed excuses for the failure of police and immigration officers to follow up on the many reports of those illegal Chinese cockle-pickers. Of course they weren’t arrested. It would only have piled up another two dozen asylum cases for Mr. Blair, and they would have been back at work in a couple of days. What he should have said is that all those poor souls who drowned would still be alive if the Chinese Government took responsibility for its own citizens. They might be back in China, but they’d be alive.\nI appreciate that it’s not always possible to ascertain someone’s nationality, and there may be problems about removing people to a war zone. In that case, there must be somewhere they can be sent – the essential point is that in no circumstances should anyone attempting illegal entry be released into the UK.\nIn that case, I believe that current government proposals to settle offenders in Rwanda are worth supporting, if they survive examination by the courts. Only when would-be illegal migrants are in no doubt that they have no prospect of a life in the UK will they stop coming. That is what I feel needs to be done in the short term, as longer-term policies – the SDP’s ideally – are put in place.\nMass immigration by the Tories and Labour is one of the many reasons why the British People should run in the direction of the Social Democratic Party as a much welcome alternative Government\nHow right you are! I was particularly interested to see the sdp supporting the deportation of immigrants who commit crimes.\nLike you I was attracted by the SDP’s policies on migration because both the two main parties have failed abysmally in controlling it, and the numbers simply keep on rising.\nFor too long there has been a lack of distinction between a migrant who is a genuine asylum seeker and one who is coming to the UK illegally simply to further their financial situation and sending remittances back to their home country.\nAnd you correctly raise the issue over documentation. If people are arriving illegally in the UK without any documentation then how can officials determine correctly if their stories are true or false? And this seems to be well-known by illegal economic migrants who deliberately destroy their paperwork (with some even encouraged to do so by unethical immigration lawyers). As such, like you I agree that the Rwanda scheme would be effective in resolving such a situation.\nThis is one of the best articles I have read by someone who was operating on the front lines of the migration crisis, and as such I have reposted it.\nIt was with some despair this week that I caught up with the comments of Paul Nowak, the TUC leader, at their congress last month, for whom our country must always embrace those fleeing “poverty, persecution or war”. Fleeing poverty …",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_decolonisation-in-the-czech-republic/content_119.html": "Under the old communist regimes of Eastern Europe, Western brands were forbidden and therefore much sought-after.\nYoung people would do anything to get their hands on a pair of Levis or some French cosmetics. To walk around in a sweatshirt with Oxford University written on it was the height of cool.\nThis wasn’t about the quality of the material good. If we bought goods on the basis of quality there would be no need for brands. This was about making a statement: establishing and signalling status, setting yourself apart from the crowd while proclaiming your allegiance to an exclusive group.\nThen came the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and full access to Western markets. Suddenly everyone in the Czech Republic could buy whatever they wanted. Branded goods began to lose their power to confer status. So how were people to set themselves apart now?\nThe answer is through a different type of Western good: the branded idea. Again, quality or content is not important. These ideas do not have to be good ideas. Indeed, as we shall see below, they are sometimes not good ideas – but they must be currently fashionable in the West.\nSeasoning one’s speech with the names of these brands, ideally while also adopting the correct facial expression and tone of voice, enables an idea to serve as a kind of password or secret handshake, proof of membership of a certain club. It is the equivalent of carrying a Gucci handbag and, like the handbag, these branded ideas function on the principle of exclusion.\nThe latest such branded idea to arrive on the scene here in the Czech Republic is the concept of decolonisation, or decolonisation™ as it might be called.\nOn the face of it, the Western version of ‘decolonisation’ would seem to be a lost cause in the Czech Republic. For centuries the Czech lands formed part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and were ruled from Vienna. During the course of the 18th and 19th centuries there was a national revival that promoted the Czech language, culture and identity, though it was not until 1918 and the end of the First World War that the First Czechoslovak Republic was created.\nHowever, following the Munich Agreement of 1938, the country was occupied by Hitler. Then in 1948 the Communist Party came to power and the country was absorbed into the Eastern Bloc before being formally occupied in reaction to the Prague Spring liberalisation of 1968. Four years after the Velvet Revolution, and with no public consultation, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech and Slovak republics, prompting Václav Havel to resign as president.\nFrom this potted history you could be forgiven for thinking that the Czechs’ interest in decolonisation™ would ensue from the history of their oppression.\nYou would be wrong for several reasons. Firstly, the Czech Republic is basically white, and as we all know, such people cannot be oppressed thanks to their white privilege™.\nSecondly, the country’s clerisy, i.e. its credentialed, cosmopolitan class who work in the media, academia, the cultural sphere, NGOs, corporate HR, Big Tech, etc. and who decide what we may and may not say and think, is an emergent group that is still trying to find its feet. At the moment, its priority is to distinguish itself as distinct and superior to the rest of the population, not to find common cause with them.\nThirdly, the Czech clerisy has little interest in righting the wrongs of colonialism, but is rather concerned with uniting with their counterparts in the West. They want to revel in feelings of guilt, self-abasement and atonement, albeit for sins they did not commit, and these special treats are only on offer to someone buying into the role of coloniser.\nFourthly, like clerisies everywhere, the Czech variety feels nothing but disdain for its compatriots, who are variously described as bumpkins, cretins, racists, bigots… ring a bell? Instead it seeks alliances with the “right-thinking” people of the West. Its members prefer to mingle with people of their own kind at international seminars, festivals and conferences and on internships, sabbaticals and residencies. It is already adopting the discourse of declinism imported from the West and views the EU as the embodiment of virtue and Brussels as a city upon a hill.\nAnd finally, the sheer contextual inappropriateness of the concept of decolonisation to the countries of Eastern Europe makes it, paradoxically, ideally fit for its true purpose. The branded idea is intended to give the impression of a special truth accessible only to the chosen, enlightened few. In reality this means that for a branded idea to confer special status upon its user it must contain a kernel of consummate stupidity that deters anyone possessing a morsel of common sense from adopting it. A Gucci handbag is not for everyone. And heaven forbid that a branded idea become popular! And so the stage is now set for the arrival of transgenderism, white privilege™, cultural appropriation™, taking the knee, and of course the triplets of diversity™, inclusivity™ and equality or equity (DIE).\nIt will be fascinating to watch the intellectual contortions involved in the illiberal application of these ideas in the Czech Republic by people proclaiming themselves to be arch-liberals.\nOne unintended irony is already evident.\nThrough its slavish adherence to Western perspectives in the form of branded ideas that are wholly inappropriate to its own experience, the Czech elite is allowing the country to be colonised once more, this time by decolonisation™.\nWell said!\nYou should never be ashamed of your heritage Yes even Britain did some unpalatable things in the colonial era but We cannot rewrite history\nIt is a young country, and I am old. Perhaps we should talk.\nYou write “the Czech Republic is basically white, and as we all know, such people cannot be oppressed thanks to their white privilege”.\nThis statement suggests you don’t believe that the Czech people were oppressed by Soviet hegemony from 1948-1989. Is this your view?\nI can see some people don’t understand irony, even in the SDP! This article makes its point brilliantly using satire. I’m sorry to find some of my fellow readers can’t see that.\nCritical Race Theory is one of the most uncritical assumptions one can find, but it fits the Wokeist belief everything is fixed: Good people are Good. Bad people are Bad. If someone has done someone harm or said something insensitive they are Bad. There are Good words and Bad words. Their meaning is not contextual but fixed. If a Good person uses a Bad word they become a Bad person. They (the preferred wokeist singular term) can never be Good again, however hard they try. There is no forgiveness for a Bad person.\nBoy always means a child, so calling an adult male friend “Dear boy” or “Old boy” is an insult since it diminishes his adult status. The same applies to any affectionate use of “girl” for a female over 18. This implies children are lesser than adults, though that must not be said. All words have only one meaning, as if English were a computer coding language.\nIt follows in CRT that white people are Bad oppressors and black people (this comes from America where people are divided into two races considered in conflict – Indigenous people and others don’t matter and are pushed onto reservations where CRT can ignore them) are Good victims. This is justified by saying white people have inherent power black people lack, known as “white privilege”. The fact some white people have black bosses who therefore have power over them is not recognised. CRT sees power endowed by skin colour rather than social or economic position.\nIn other words, as this article points out, the whole thing is intellectually dubious to the point of absurdity, but it is taught as fact in schools and universities throughout the world or, at least, the English-speaking world, because it is enforced through fear. Any academic who questions it is a Bad person and will therefore be sacked as deserved. Few dare risk that and those who did have paid the price.\nNow I’ve spelt it out do you get it?",

Ollie is passionate advocate of the SDP’s philosophy and platform, and while studying at Durham he established the revived SDP’s first university society. In standing for Batley and Spen, Ollie intends to offer local voters a unique choice for a party – one that’s unreservedly patriotic, pro-jobs, pro-family, and willing to stand for freedom of speech.\n“I’m honoured to be standing to represent the people of Batley and Spen,” says SDP candidate Ollie Purser. “In this by-election, I’ll be standing to offer local people a chance to vote for a party that believes in actively fighting for jobs, reindustrialisation, families, and freedom of speech. Through offering a sensible combination of policies, the SDP is the only party that is working to address the social and economic concerns of working-class towns like Batley, Cleckheaton, and Birkenshaw.”\n“While the two main parties see Batley and Spen merely as a place to generate headlines, in this election we’re looking to offer this constituency something genuinely novel – politics that reflects their values, and economics that’s in their interests,” adds SDP leader William Clouston. “In contrast to the broken two main parties the SDP is for bringing industry back into Britain, investing in public services and infrastructure, taking a firm stance on crime and social issues, and protecting freedom of expression in schools and in public. These sensible stances are what resonate with local people, and we’re looking forward to giving them a chance to vote for them on July 1st.”",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_pr-house-of-lords-reform-democratic-deficit-need-to-change-two-party-gridlock/content_110.html": "It’s time to breathe life back into our politics. And for that we need to make bold changes to address our democratic deficit.\nThe UK General Election only a year away and Labour is – so far – storming ahead in the polls. You might be expecting jubilation from the British Left after its utter humiliation in the 2019 General Election. Instead, however, the left-wing media seem rather indifferent about the prospect of a Labour victory under Keir Starmer. As Brian Reade has put it in the Mirror: “If Keir Starmer has a vision, I’d love to see it”.\nIndeed, post-Conference season, for many voters it would be a serious challenge to identify any meaningful policy differences between the Tories and Labour, who seem to have both converged on both economic and social policy, offering voters only a superficial choice. It’s Coke against Diet Coke. This is a problem directly attributable to our first-past-the-post electoral system, which encourages tactical voting, but leaves voters never really getting what they want from either of the two main parties.\nAs has been discussed on SDPTalks before, but which nonetheless is worth repeating, a far better system would be to have Proportional Representation (PR), where electoral subgroups are represented proportionally in Parliament. Under this system, both the Soft Left and Hard Left could have their own respective parties, with there likely being two right-wing parties to choose from as well. Some argue that PR would lead to weak government, since no one party will have a majority and a coalition government would have no single mandate. I wonder though if these people have been watching the current Conservative government – unable to fulfill many of its manifesto promises despite winning an 80-seat majority in 2019.\nGiven this demonstrable failure to deliver, I would argue that PR is a better system for holding larger parties to account. Under PR, tactical voting would be unnecessary due to smaller parties having a much larger voice in Parliament. This would not only scare the larger parties into delivering but would also hopefully lead to a more interesting and diverse political conversation, with more radical economic and social reforms being proposed. Additionally, under PR every vote will count. There will be no “safe seats” where voting Conservative or Labour is pointless. This in itself would go a long way to reducing political apathy, particularly among young and working-class voters among whom voter turn-out is particularly low.\nYet it would be wrong to attribute this country’s democratic deficit solely to first-past-the-post. Another obstacle to radical reform is the House of Lords, which sees its job as to oppose, stifle, and sufficiently water down government policies. It is, as is so often somehow overlooked, completely undemocratic. Even worse is the fact that the House of Lords is unaccountable, with life peers being appointed by the Prime Minister, sometimes in exchange for significant party donations.\nIndeed, according to The Times, Starmer has pledged to “flood” the House of Lords with Labour Peers. Much like the European Union, the equally undemocratic House of Lords would surely also be rejected by the British people if the question of abolition was put to a referendum. But rather than replace the House of Lords – as Labour proposes, with an elected “upper house of nations and regions” – we should instead opt for a unicameral system with one house for one United Kingdom.\nOf course, the argument made against having one house will be that an upper chamber provides checks on the power of the House of Commons, refining the legislation, on occasion bringing valuable expertise. Yet the trade-off here is that having an upper chamber frustrates the passing of legislation, often leading to slow, inefficient government policymaking.\nEven with a democratically-elected upper chamber, the issue remains in that the very role of an upper chamber is to frustrate or even block the passing of legislation – often leading to political gridlock – against the wishes of the people. That’s not just in the UK. In the United States last year its upper house, the Senate, blocked legislation which would have codified the right to an abortion into federal law. Having a democratically-elected upper house would, it seems, very little difference to its freedom to frustrate the will of the people. Instead, the UK should join other European countries, like Denmark and Sweden, whose unicameral parliaments consist of only one house.\nOf course, if Labour wins by a landslide, then Starmer is unlikely to want to give up such a large majority by introducing PR. It is also unlikely that there will be a referendum on the House of Lords when Labour has already said that it will either replace it with an elected upper house or give it a comprehensive Labour do-over. As much as those on the Left may hope, radical democratic reform is not going to happen under a Labour government. Instead, there must be a cross-party movement for constitutional change.\nRadical reform is the only way to breathe life back into our democracy. The party that realizes this and acts upon it will surely be rewarded by voters.\nI could not agree more with Samuel Turner about the need for change in Britain the British system could learn a lot from the German Lander Federal System as well as a Written Constitution and eventually becoming a Federal Republic, I would not bet on Keir Starmer’s Labour becoming our next Government the Party internal strife over Israel and Palestine as well as Antisemitism will only benefit Rishi Sunak who I could see the Conservatives pulling off a surprise election victory,I prefer a Social Democratic Government maybe one day\nGood article.\nThe existence of the devolved parliaments/assemblies/mayors could also be said to function as a check on the UK house of commons!\nThese First Ministers and Mayors seem to go out of their way to interfere on national issues whether it is covid or israel/palestine.\nToday with David Cameron appointed as Foreign Secretary and Life Peer it is even more clear that democracy needs reform in this country.\nThe 4 useless parties maybe optimistic about their electoral chances at the General Election at the end of next Year 2024,I don’t know anyone wants these people in Office, Rishi Sunak is on borrowed time his Party will remove Him sooner rather than later,Keir Starmer is another nohoper who has zero personality or Charisma lead’s a Shadow cabinet who makes Sunak’s ConSocialists look like rank amateurs in comparison North of the Border We have the SNP led by a man who is no Nicola Sturgeon or Alex Salmond, the voting system needs to be replaced with Proportional Representation, Britain needs to be Federalised and the Govermental system decentralised and becoming a Federal Republic with a codified Written Constitution\nWell. More UK/GB wanting political parties, like SDP being a part of the democratic system. Not pro-devolution political parties ie. SNP, Plaid Cymru, Alba, etc that want to divide & end this country.\nI very much agree with the points the author is making here. When it comes to Proportional Representation, this is not a new, untried system, but operates in all European countries other than the UK (please correct me if I’m wrong here) and their governments seem to operate perfectly well.\nAs for the House of Lords, there is defintely a need to replace this with an electoral assembly. I am rather against the idea of a unicameral parliament, instead believing we need an upper house (just as, say, the US and Poland do) to fulfil the role of checks and balances. If its members are elected, then its decisions and actions will have a lot more validity.\nWill we ever see either of these come about? There has always been a lot of discussion and debate but no concrete action as such. Perhaps we will one day have a government that is prepared to make radical changes for the benefit of the country’s long-term interests, but we can only live in hope.\nWhat if the government were kicked out of parliament? It should be elected directly, and made answerable *to* an elected parliament.",
  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-conservative-and-labour-parties-are-failing-to-give-the-public-what-it-most-craves-people-and-ideas-it-can-trust/content_141.html": "Trust is, according to psychologists, described as a belief in a probability that a person will behave in certain ways, will prove dependable. Trust, then, is central to a feeling of confidence – that’s as true between people and institutions as it is between each of us.\nIt can seem that that feeling of confidence is at a bleak low point. Like many others, that troubles me because I want to know that there is a journey ahead along which my children, future grandchildren and future great-grandchildren will find the foundations to be safe, healthy and happy.\nRecent events have only undermined my sense of confidence in that further still. Not just the Post Office, maternity wards and blood transfusion scandals – to name just three of what feels like many more true jaw-droppers – in which the needs of an organisation rode roughshod over the needs of people. But also in the attitudes expressed by the behaviours of the two main parties, which, for my money, further show them both to lack an internally coherent sense of trust that anyone might naturally seek in their government.\nBoth seem to have forgotten that, once lost, trust is so very hard to regain. And that, once the moral strictures of trust are let go, it’s all too easy for things to spiral out of control. Theft starts small – maybe £5, out of desperation for food, to give an example from my professional life in the grocery industry – but this seed so often grows out of control.\nTake Rishi Sunak’s announcement of the forthcoming general election date, a statement that was as wet as the weather it was staged in but, far more importantly – astonishingly, really – was seemingly made without speaking to his MPs, leaving his party with a need to fill 150 seats in desperately short measure. Great teamwork Rishi…\nOf these, 77 are accounted for by MPs standing down. Many reasons are cited for this decision – from mental health to long tenure. But one can’t help but imagine these MPs also considering the Conservatives’ public image as the party that had parties during the pandemic, foisting a punishing, ruinous lockdown on the public while ignoring the same restrictions for themselves. They know the writing is now very much on the wall. Nonetheless, how can Sunak expect to have the trust of the nation if he can’t maintain the trust of his own MPs?\nThen there is the rush of Conservative MPs – including a former minister – to cross the floor. Of course people should be free to change their ideological position. But the timing here looks to be entirely self-serving. Remember that well-known saying of the corporate world, “There’s no ‘I’ in team”? How do these MPs suddenly shifting from blue to red expect their new peers – never mind their constituencies – to trust them when they change their mind with the wind?\nThat Kier Starmer hasn’t rejected their approaches out of hand is a wonder. But the state of trust is hardly any better within the Labour Party. Diane Abbot and Dr Faiza Shaheen, both of who have made admittedly ill-judged comments in the media, or liked an unpleasant post on social media, have been unceremoniously hung out to dry by their leader. No wonder one is – at time of writing – now considering not standing at the next election and the other as an independent.\nThe Abbot example is particularly enlightening. And discouraging. The sheer audacity of restoring the whip to Abbot – who, love her or loathe her, has devoted herself to the Labour cause for decades – only to then tell her she can’t stand for the party and, only after media and public outcry, that she can after all, clearly displays the culture that Starmer is creating in the Labour Party. The fear, of course, is that this sets to tone for Britain too, should Labour win the election. How can the British public trust Starmer to make courageous and bold and clearly argued decisions for the good of the country and stick to them if this is his method?\nThe British people need to be able to see stability, hear realistic promises backed by fact not fantasy, feel that they are being led by people who have their best interests at heart – which, and here’s the challenge of leadership, sometimes means breaking with our own selfish interests – and trust that this leader will follow through on the inevitably tough choices.\nThe lack of communication, the desperation, the defections and rejections would suggest that the Conservative and Labour Parties alike are unable to provide this.\nPerhaps this is an easier thing to shout about from the sidelines. But while the modern incarnation of the SDP hasn’t been in government, its consistency and directness stands in stark contrast all the same. Indeed, its very consistency in argument and messaging – its Pensions, Welfare and Social Security policy, for example, states clearly what the party would do and how it would be paid for – strikes me as so refreshing. Here we are weeks from a general election and who knows what either the Conservative or Labour Parties actually stand for? Not that this is exactly a new problem…\nPerhaps this is one reason why some political commentators have suggested that this will be an election of Sunak vs Starmer, with neither men having the committed backing of their parties. But that, of course, is to get lost in the assumption that British politics needs to be the same old two horse race. There is a third, serious, credible option. The SDP’s membership may need patience but it should never let go of the trust it has in its ideas or in each other, because trust works.\nTake an instance from sport. Gareth Southgate and Sarina Weigman have both now taken an England team to a major football final by giving their players and staff a clear message, selling them a plan, earning their respect and trust and in turn trusting their teams. It so nearly finished in glory with no scandal whatsoever. The nation lifts in these moments and comes together precisely because they are exemplary. It’s no coincidence that these leaders are still in place today.\nWe are coming to the situation of sooner than later We will no longer have either of the LabCon uni party being in Government do not take any notice of the opinion polls too much remember how they got it wrong in 2017 and 2019 the pollsters said Corbyn was going to win He lost to May and Johnson no one cares for Starmer either\nI dread a Labour or Conservative administration We need alternatives in Government to Starmer and Sunak\nNice of the BBC to mention that the Social Democratic Party is fielding it’s most candidates in 37 years the Social Democratic Party is that alternative to another tedious Labour or Conservative administration\nWe deserve better than Starmer and Sunak the sdp can be that hope the British Public are waking up to the uni party LabCon\nYour article highlights today’s lack of statemanship. Why would anyone stick to the rules when no-one in office can do it. To read so many disasters catalogued in one article is thoroughly depressing.\nThe duopoly stinks and once known enough, as you mention, the SDP will feel like a refreshing, trustworthy alternative option. I guess it’s just a waiting game. My worry is, just how bad will things get over the next parliament.\nHi Annie,\nThank you for your comments,\nYour worry is like so many others, however, maybe there is a small light at the end of a very long tunnel, as we all know, things will get worse before they get better\nThe recent marchers in London are uniting the uk every patriot who could get there went why won’t the SDP support the British people ?\nThe Westminster elite want to dissolve British culture, heritage and history where are the politician’s who stand up and protect it respect it and appreciate it\nI am a SDP member i would expect my party to stand tall be there fighting for this great country attacking the parties promoting open borders and reassuring a majority of people the SDP are patriotic and pro Britain",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_how-black-lives-matter-is-destroying-race-relations-in-britain/content_445.html": "Have race relations in Britain got better or worse since the Black Lives Matter protests here, sparked by the death of George Floyd in America?\nEven to ask the question seems daft, since it seems obvious that there has been a notable deterioration.\nLots of black people have been radicalised against a society (and presumably also against its majority white inhabitants) that they now believe to be systematically conspiring against them on racial grounds. And lots of white people – especially working class white people and those from post-industrial areas with few economic opportunities – are now simmering with resentment at being told by posh London commentators they have benefited from racial privilege and must ‘educate’ themselves about this.\nWhen media supporters of Black Lives Matter (BLM) relentlessly promote figures and incidents showing BAME individuals getting an apparently disproportionate amount of attention from police, it’s small wonder that even the politically correct Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick is moved to highlight uncomfortable facts about the “huge” over-representation of young black men in serious crime.\nLikewise, when Premier League footballers all “take a knee” before every match, it’s small wonder that a plane trailing the banner “White Lives Matter, Burnley” is flown over a ground.\nAnd anyone who believes that such feelings of resentment about being marginalised or ignored are only shared by Far Right types isn’t getting out enough.\nAlmost everything nowadays is being seen through the prism of race. The importing of Critical Race Theory from US academia and the penalisation of anyone in authority who contests it has imposed conditions that make the idea of living in a harmonious multi-racial society seem like a faraway pipe dream.\nAll of this might be contested by BLM supporters, but I must draw your – and their attention – to an extraordinary report by BBC News, Wales that was clearly designed to bolster the view that BLM campaigning is progressive and necessary but in fact demonstrates precisely the opposite.\nIn this article a series of BLM campaigners in Wales are interviewed about the impact the campaign has had on their lives.\nOne, Natera Morris from Cardiff, is quoted as saying: “I’ve had a lot of the same friends for 24 years and this has been the only thing that has divided us.” She has been left wondering whether these people were ever her friends at all. Yet, seeing as they formed and then sustained a friendship with Natera, they clearly cannot have been out and out racists in the first place.\n“It’s not nice to have to throw away a long friendship over this but (BLM) is incredibly important to me,” she says.\nAnother campaigner, Joe Newman, fell out with a close friend who he judged to be using racist rhetoric when debating the issues raised by BLM. “This is a person I thought I knew. They didn’t even give me a chance to explain my views and to help educate them – they just refused,” says Joe.\nHe has removed half a dozen people he considered close friends from his social media circle.\nNadia Thomas, a BLM organiser from Chepstow, reports a similar experience, saying she was surprised to get a negative response from someone who had been in her life for years.\n“Not all of these people who have a defensive position are necessarily racist. It was just their defensive response,” she says.\nNaturally, this being the BBC, the report concludes with the Welsh Government saying it will step up its emphasis on racial education with “new learning resources” coming on stream soon to “improve the teaching of Black, Asian and minority ethnic experiences and history”.\nBut, of course, there is another way of looking at all this.\nA saner way: A bunch of well-intentioned young people in Wales have fallen out with long-term friends after becoming fixated on race off the back of the BLM protests. Their friends were and are not racists and may well have had a genuinely colour-blind approach to forming a social circle – what we used to fondly regard as the ideal. But the ideal has now become impossible for all those who will not tamely submit to an analysis that defines ’whiteness‘ as a privileged characteristic that must be corrected and apologised for (what one of the BLM interviewees referred to as allowing him to “help to educate them”).\nSo, sorry lads and lasses of BLM, but it’s you who have in baked discord and division to no obvious good or useful end. At a peer group level you have seen long-term friendships break up, which must be sad and painful. I expect this is happening in multi-racial friendship circles all over the UK at the moment.\nIf I decided to obsess about historic injustice and suddenly started wandering around hyping my vaguely Irish Catholic heritage and demanding that my mates apologised to me for what Cromwell did in Drogheda and Wexford and for all those “No dogs, no blacks, no Irish” signs in 1960s boarding house windows, demanding they allow me to ‘educate’ them in correct political thinking, I reckon my own social circle might contract as well.\nBut I wouldn’t conclude that this meant there should be yet more official and media emphasis on the ancient injustices of Irish history or that the volume should be turned up to eleven until everyone agreed with me. I’d conclude that becoming a pain in the arse had turned me into Billy No Mates.\nA contrary view of BLM, one that I happen to agree with. Although I’d be more scathing than calling them ‘a pain in the butt. Thankfully one party, the SDP, are prepared to debate this matter (as others), offering an alternative view.\nIt has become impossible to discuss the issue of #BLM. Let me assure you that having been born in a council estate in the 1950’s, if there was such a thing as White Privilege it has passed me by. Following Thatchers end to The so called “Jobs for life” my post Royal Naval work life was great between Redundancies. Finally being sacked for not being able to get NHS Treatment quickly enough in my early 60’s. Yet again my long suffering wife had to put up with losing another home because ESA does not pay the Mortgage. We have had to move away from our friends, again. I have experienced NO PRIVILEGE WHATSOEVER.\nI bend my knee to my Monarch but no one else.\nAll blm supporters need educating about the extremely harsh lives that British coal miners and their families lived for a couple of hundred years and the farming peasants before that and life in UK work houses where we were treated abominable, the last of which only closed in the 1930s! How dare they call us privileged. My father and his mining family nearly died of starvation, my great grandfather ran a soup kitchen to stop starvation in our mining village! I’m so disgusted at their lack of knowledge of British white working class history. As one of the most invaded countries over the last 2,000 years should we hate the Romans, the Norman’s, the French, the Germans? We don’t and we shouldn’t, it’s ancient history but we should learn it and learn from it.\nThe whole concept of white privilege and critical race theory is extremely divisive and is a new cause of racial problems. BLM and the indoctrination associated with it is having the opposite of the intended effects. They are by all intents and purposes a far left group sowing hatred and racial tensions. It should be illegal as much as Naziism is illegal. Too far right and too far left is the same thing – intolerance, persecution, hatred.\nCould it be that in just 2 months BLM have managed to put “the idea of living in a harmonious multi-racial society ” back 60 years?\nSpot on , there agenda is extremely divisive and has no discernible limits to what it wants to achieve other than creating an ‘ us and them ‘ scenario , it is toxic\nVery interesting and true. I do believe we have taken a backward step. I do not have black friends as such but black and brown work friends. It doesn’t feel right using these words and feels alien. I had not seen colour before, not consciously anyway. I am very saddened to see what’s happening and truely do not believe we live in a systematic racial country. It makes me angry now seeing protests and even the itv advert. I feel like it is being rammed in our faces whether we like it or not. I was born and raised here. I have never know such Assad times\nSpot on, the BLM hysteria has harmed race relations, because people resent feeling they are being deemed racist.\nSpot on. The BLM hysteria has harmed race relations. People resent being deemed racist and support for the cause on TV and by organisations and companies is both unnecessary and ridiculous. Which laws need to be passed or changed which don’t already exist? It’s a false narrative pursued by activists with a spurious agenda.\nall I see protesting are white entitled bored middle class students who think they are entitled to speak for all of us\nGreat article. Thank you. This is also being reflected in genuflecting of masters degree educated people to the revolting falsehood of intersectionalism (which they deny is a form of racism), promoted by intelligent people who’ve either read a DiAngelo book (or say they agree with it), or think, having done a primer in critical race theory or a gender studies course, they now have the skills to rampage across the world making everyone conform to their delusions.\nFirstly, these ways of looking at our unequal world are not accepted by much of the mainstream of social thought (even by some of the Left), as their believers deny proper evidence-based approaches are required to falsify them. Since I am no expert I shall not go further here. I may get it wrong.\nThis is a potentially disasterous moment for Western civilization. With the severe damage from covid19 some of us are very very worried about major unrest. It has been brewing for years, as radical leftism has fomented resentment and bitterness toward the culture that has given THEM the freedoms enabling their own thinking to be aired! They never read Alexander Solzhenitsyn perhaps.\nThe BLM have some power, but appear badly led. If we can get them to debate the real issues, then they can be exposed as intellectually and socially vacuous in thinking. Their Marxism must be exposed. They do not have case in the UK, I believe. The main problem in the UK is the extreme Left that has dominated state schools for 20 years or more. Schools such as the Michaela School in London have demonstrated that, free of Leftist governers and with good school discipline, children from all sectors, including black children, do very well.\nThere is a broader truth behind intersectionality, but one the social justice warriors seem blind to.\nThere are many things that affect our life chances. Race, gender and sexuality no doubt play a part, but of even greater importance are intelegence, psychological variables such as conscientiousness or nuerotisism, family background and education, even atractiveness. And each of us is a unique mix of all of the above. So ultimately the logic of intersectionality takes us back to the great truth of the liberal enlightenment, that we are all individuals, and should be valued and treated as such.\nVery good article, all very true. The white privilege nonsense is exactly that. Certainly didn’t experience it in my life, from bedsits to council estate to Army to 5 redundancies & a crap pension from a government who couldn’t care less. Everything I’ve had in my life I’ve had to graft for. This BLM crap is the most divisive movement I’ve seen in this Country in my lifetime, stinks of the left wing view of something for nothing. I agree with Dominic Raab, only bend my knee to my wife to propose, & to my Queen.\nThis article is possibly one of the best and most accurate articles about the current state of the uk i have read.\nA fair and balanced view of both sides.\nSadly i think we are in for much more or this before it gets better\nThey have systematically caused division and descention by there actions. I was never a racist but now find myself calling them for everything.. I saw the person not the colour but now because of comments from them are no longer interested in any of the verbal diarrhoea that comes out their mouths. A few have come out against them and I applaud them for that. Let them find a deserted island and set up their utopia.\nThe reason why the BLM demos are so large is that there are no real opposition to the crackball theories. I also agree that there stupidity and actions have put race relations back fifty years. Try telling my grandson who is white that he is in a privileged position due to his skin colour and I know what he would say.\nThank you Patrick, an excellent summary of the situation. BLM and their supporters and apologists have undoubtedly worsened race relations in this country. I have a particular concern for the Police in all this. Their actions, for instance in stop-and-search, are invariably linked to institutional racism, although I believe I am right in saying that the seemingly disproportionate stopping of black people is better explained by their disproportionate representation in the offender population than in the behaviour of the Police. To that end, I’ve thought for some time that our law and order policies should include a commitment to establish an independent Office of Evidence Based Policing, charged with the task of properly informing our endless debates about this and other policing issues. Fighting BLM’s misleading and socially damaging assertions with hard evidence might not stop the racists inside and outside the BLM movement from continuing to make a noise on the streets, but it would be invaluable in marginalising their views and hampering their recruitment of other ill-informed people. More importantly, it would give ordinary folk the information they need, in the privacy of their own homes and thoughts, to make informed views of what is really happening in their world and what, if anything, needs to be done about it.\nExcellent. Told with great clarity and logic.\nLaurence Fox, the actor, is proposing a new political party based on a desire to reclaim our country’s tolerant values. I hope he will not steal the ground of the SDP.\nThe authorities are wondering why the public has lost respect for the police. The answer is that we have witnessed them taking the knee to this toxic rhetoric and doing nothing whilst statues are torn down and thrown into the river.\nAfter the Norman Conquest, the majority of the indigenous population in the Uk were made into serfs with the importation of a rigid feudal social and economic structure. A serf was owned by the lord of the manor, and tied to the land. In other words, the majority of white people in this country are descended from slaves as well. There were serfs/slaves in France and wherever feudalism was imposed. There were serfs in Russia until the nineteenth century.\nIn the UK, it was only the different conditions created by the deaths of between a third and a half of the population through the outbreak of plague known as the Black Death (I expect that will be renamed in due course) that led to the breaking down of serfdom and feudalism.\nYet the Black Lives Matter movement never mentions this obvious historical fact, that the majority of the white population are probably descended at least in part from serfs. Perhaps their historical knowledge is in fact, very limited? Do they in fact, need to ‘educate themsleves’?\nThis fact might make a good riposte to anyone shouting about ‘white privilige’.\nVery little if anything good will be achieved by this radical movement and it’s appeasement by Organizations and authorities. It’s whole philosophy is based on grievance and revenge and not on reconciliation or redemption. I experienced a deeply troubling experience with my daughter around this issue when her genuine compassion for all disadvantaged people allowed the BLM message to influence her into thinking she was especially privileged purely because of her skin colour. I was deeply upset when she expressed her views to me and had not our relationship been so strong the ensuing discussion would have damaged it. She is indeed privileged in many ways but none of it due to her skin colour. Her grandparents were from the many poorly educated Irish labouring classes who came to England in search of work. They experienced petty prejudice and distrust but worked hard and overcame many obstacles to eventually become accepted and loved members of their neighbourhood. They bore no malice toward the people or the country that had given them the opportunity of a good life and opportunities for their children to do the same. My daughter owes a lot to those simple people who never looked for or received anything for which they didn’t work. I was incensed that my well educated and intelligent daughter could be so misguided by this false ‘gospel’ that she should feel guilty for being white and for prejudices which she didn’t express or even. possess. The BLM movement is deeply poisonous because it is rooted in hate, revenge and reparation. No successful or peaceful society can ever be built on these foundation stones.\nBlack people who don’t agree with BLM/critical race theory and who speak out against it, even mildly, are coming up against torrent of abuse denouncing them as “Uncle Toms”, “coconuts”, “coons”, “house negro” etc. by other black people on social media (and in some cases in real life), even here in the UK. It’s absolutely repellent and extremely ugly, and is designed to silence them into submission. Some of these power-drunk activists who hide behind the banner of anti-racism have no problem at all with spitting the most hateful racist slurs at other black people they disagree with. All of this woke stuff that’s seeped over from the US and radicalised people via online social contagion has created a situation where within minority groups, people feel entitled to abuse and shun anyone who doesn’t display the right fealties. I hate it.\nI absolutely agree with this article in its entirety. But, perhaps more could be said about the sneaky ideology that drives BLM. Also, the fact that the increasing presence of critical race theory in mainstream media as if we all accept the truth of its fundamental premises has emboldened those such as Kehinde Andrews who is an out and out racist. This man can barely conceal his contempt and hatred for so called white people. Perhaps you have seen the website ‘make it plain’. The left has gone mad I have always considered myself as being’ on the left’ but oh boy they have lost me. I am most definitely looking for an alternative.\nThank you for mentioning Andrews – looked him up and agree.\nI’m so glad I read this… Its clearly & logically written & sums up in an understandable way what I’ve repeatedly been trying to say on social media. I know I’m not a racist… I genuinely believe in racial equality… But BLM has nothing to do with equality & I’m tired of being attacked because I can’t put into words what I know & feel. Thank you.\nTake a look at a piece in November’s issue of The Critic by writer and journalist Michael Collins titled Why I Am No Longer Talking To Black People About Race. At the time of writing this is not yet available on The Critic webpage but in the published hard copy of the magazine only.\nI’m an Amercian and I couldn’t agree with you more. Very well-stated. The pendelum has swung so hard that you can say nearly anything you want about white people in the USA and you’ll be viewed a progressive but say anything about “African Americans” and no matter how well-founded and cogent the thought is you’ll be branded a “racist.” I believe BLM by name and strategy is incredibly divisive and potentially damaging to real progress. It’s ceratinly the opposite of what MLK preached. Thanks for sharing a saner viewpoint!\nThis seems like a common sense article. I have no idea what’s happening in our society but it’s all like crazy, dissonant sound clashing in our ears and the author of this article is right, because we can’t make sense of it we’re picking out the frequencies we’re most attuned to and that is polarising us as a nation.\nThere are issues to be addressed, no doubt, but these are never going to be solved by the divisive narrative which seems all of a sudden to dominate national consciousness, particularly of the young.\nI was genuinely shocked (hurt would be a better description) when after an internet search I clicked on a link to the Girl Guides position on BLM which seemed like an article of political indoctrination rather than something which explained to young people the need to respect those of ever ethnic origin. It described the UK as founded on racism and as institutionally racist today.\nBLM seems to have taken on a life of its own with all the symbolic trappings of ideology or religion, taking the knee for instance.\nAgree. However Multiculturalism is always doomed to fail. Look at Yugoslavia as example. I live in Leicester where we are told we are a celebration of Multiculturalism. Yet in reality we are not. White, Black, Asian live in there own neighbourhoods. Rarely integrate, even speak English.\nWe then have to look at Bradford years ago. There was graffiti on walls telling White people to leave. Nothing was done and i suspect relations are worse.\nImmigration can be good. If people are told to integrate and not giving special privileges. Keep your culture but remember you adopt ours as well.\nGreat piece!\nBLM have backed themselves into a corner here, and are basically saying that they deserve a free ride over and above all other ethnic groups most of which are successfully embedding themselves into the fabric of our country. I for one felt things were going in the right direction prior to this development and colour was becoming irrelevant, and am saddened fearing that this will be a major step backwards.\nI get sick of hearing people hanging on to the slave trade and basically making a career out of it!\nThe slave trade was an example of man kinds inhumanity on both sides. It happened’ move on and forge a new identity! its just lazy to eat the chips of your shoulder for the rest of your life.\nIts also a matter of serious concern that mainly young black people are killing each other with knives on an almost daily basis, as they are choosing a path in life of no return, when they have the choice and resources not to do so. This for many people I speak to makes a mockery of the whole argument. Lets not forget one of the main causes of racism is behaviour not skin tone.\nAbsolutely agree with this article, my very best school friend of 30 years stopped talking to me last year after a discussion on this topic. When she was kicked out by her mother my family housed her from 15-17 years old as she was my mate and my family supported both her and me. I cannot tell you how it has rocked me to the core as we have been so close, we would talk every day. My mother looked upon her as a second daughter and treated her accordingly, later in life she asked my father to give her away at her wedding as her father was not in contact and hadn’t been since she was 7. We would spend holidays together, nights out. There wasn’t anything that we couldn’t talk about. Until last year, we would have stilted conversations about why I would be friends with a block woman and how I was a covert racist, not only that….my family were too.\nIt’s taken me about a year of upset to finally face the fact that I have lost my darling friend.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_on-party-politics-and-proportional-representation/content_25.html": "Britain has sleepwalked into a new era of soulless politics. British politics now resembles a long-running rivalry between two supermarket giants battling to cut prices, win market share, and deliver returns to their investors. A victory for either side ultimately results in little meaningful change in direction, national spirit, or popular will. A British political system, designed to promise stability and prosperity, has instead ushered in decades of political stagnation. Power is neither created, nor destroyed. Instead, it is shuffled around the backbenches. The same familiar faces and the same old ideas float around the chambers and, unsurprisingly, little changes. Conservative ministers stuff their pockets at the taxpayers’ expense while Labour backbenches wax lyrical about the working man, before quietly shuffling to the House of Lords to accept a life-peerage.\nIn Britain, a victory at the ballot box is not a victory for conservatism, socialism, or liberalism. Rather, it is the victory for the archetypal political party. Can the 2019 general election be sincerely framed as a victory of conservatism over socialism? If society is any reflection of this election, the answer is evidently no. UK politics has been gutted, spiritually, and above all, ideologically.\nPolitical parties should serve to represent ideology or cultural affiliation, acting in the interests of politically engaged citizens. Under first-past-the-post however, this is an impossibility. Both the Conservative and Labour parties are currently doomed to preside over a soulless husk of a utilitarian electoral machine. This is evidenced by the current state of the ‘big two.’ The Conservative Party’s attempts to erect a large enough party to cater to the majority of society has failed, collapsing its “big tent” ideal. Any mention of conservative ideals is ramped up in the run up to an election, then promptly cast aside after their inevitable victory. The Labour Party has fared no better. Its attempts to shift the goalposts to incorporate a new generation of socially conscious youth has spiritually gutted the platform, leaving in its place a largely contrarian and turbulent mix of warring socialists and social democrats.\nThe barrier to entry for new parties in the UK is so impossibly high that voters are ultimately doomed to operate on the principle of “closest fit.” Given the choice, libertarians would likely not share a platform with Cameronite Tories, nor would Corbynistas rub shoulders with Blairites. A core founding principle behind liberty is the freedom of association; however, this has been long forgotten within the UK. Popular politics and grassroots activism must be rewarded with representation. Irrespective of political persuasion, it is criminal that Nigel Farage’s UK Independence Party, who have undoubtedly changed the face of British politics, only received parliamentary representation through limited high-profile defections. Equally unjust is the current level of representation received by the Greens, who have been making great inroads into UK politics for many years without much voice in parliament.\nSimply put, it is time for change. To breathe life back into political discourse, the UK must abandon first-past-the-post and embrace proportional representation. The SDP has recognised this structural failure in our UK electoral system. Having given its support to Makes Votes Matter, a bipartisan multi-party pressure group campaigning for electoral reform, the SDP has clearly signalled that it intends to support the reintroduction of politics into our otherwise apolitical parliamentary system. Success for the SDP at polls will be, in part, bolstered by the success of this cause. When electoral reform arrives, and it inevitably will, smaller parties will be emboldened to sweep up many captive voters from both the Conservatives and Labour. The SDP, as a party of the patriotic centre of UK politics, could well be an attractive choice in a new and vibrant market of political self-expression.\nTo see proportional representation in action, one need only look across the channel. The Netherlands, a fellow constitutional monarchy, has fully embraced PR. The level of political freedom in the Netherlands is admirable and almost incomprehensible in FPTP Britain. The Dutch enjoy a huge degree of representation on a political level. On the right alone, there exists a party for liberal conservatives, right-wing populists, Christian democrats, national conservatives, evangelists, agrarians, e-government activists, regionalists, separatists, libertarians, and more. Most of these parties, at some point, have had a say in the everyday running of government and on the choices that impact Dutch lives.\nAdmittedly, coalition building can be messy, arduous, and even frustrating. However, it is a far cry from the “coalitions of chaos” Theresa May warned of in the event of a Conservative minority government. The Dutch have illustrated that even in times of complicated alliance building, the workings of the state carry on as usual. The importance difference, however, is that under a proportional system- every vote matters. A vote cast under a proportional system allows voters to vote by conviction, knowing well that backing the winning horse may not necessarily be the best way to see their own policy preferences set in motion.\nWhile proportional representation could cause teething problems in Westminster, it could very well save the Union. If the 2019 general election had been decided proportionally, the vote share for the SNP would have been slashed significantly, from 48 seats down to 20, perhaps signalling a more complicated independence picture. While devolved Scottish elections enjoy a greater degree of proportional representation, 73 of 129 MSPs are still elected through first-past-the-post voting. Statistically, PR would be the great equaliser, slashing the gap between Conservative and Labour, rewarding newcomers, and setting new clear targets for independence movements.\nUK electoral reform, however, is unlikely to spell the end for the familiar parties for which many of us have campaigned and supported in the past. If the major parties fought hard enough, they could very well prevent the balkanisation of their parties into ideological factions. The Conservatives could battle to keep their electorate intact, and may even remain the largest party. No matter how Conservative party backers frame it, PR is certainly not about punishing the Conservative Party. Regardless of vote share, the resulting political climate under PR would be a much fairer; allowing new parties to challenge seats and win hearts and minds.\nPR isn’t about breaking parties apart; it is about levelling the playing field. We should once again stand steadfast behind our political convictions, vote with our feet, and advocate for a new and fair system. To advance the goals and objectives of a new and fair Britain, I urge SDP voters to visit Make Votes Matter and join their bipartisan campaign for electoral reform.\nWe need a codified written constitution and become a Federal republic similar to German system the behaviour of the Johnson government and it’s authoritarian style of management over the last year is outrageous. https://www.federalunion.org.uk\nI believe in AV for the Commons, PR for the Upper House along with equal power and simultaneous.elections STV for local elections ,referendums on major issues. Will happily elaborate.\nMy main concern with PR is that it negates one of the prime strengths of FPTP, namely that it provides strong government. Our constitution is entirely geared around a strong government that can do a lot with its majority. Now, people will say the current approach is unfair. Perhaps, and that is perhaps a bad thing, but in its favour FPTP does deliver strong governments, and moreover, changing to PR would mean that the rest of the constitutional system would have to adjust too. I don’t know how, but I am sure there would be unintended consequences for this reason. Be careful what you wish for.\nI disagree with almost every sentence of this piece. Proportional representation would not, and does not, secure the representation he desires. Rather, it acts as a way of protecting indefinitely the ‘boss class’ from political pressure from below. When election results merely result in the same people changing the governmental chairs they occupy, there is nothing for them to fear.\nThe Netherlands illustrates this dramatically, actually. A few months before the introduction of the Euro, I was visited in Asia by a delegation of Dutch investors. I gave them my 30 minutes account of Asia’s economies, and asked for questions. The one I got was this: ‘When will Britain join the Euro?’ I answered ‘Never, because it would certainly destroy any party which voted it in’. There followed a moment or two of Dutch muttering among themselves. And then one said: ‘Yes, we understand. It’s the First Past the Post System. In the Netherlands we don’t want to join either, but the parties can ignore that because even if we vote them down, they’ll still be in government’.\nYes, FPTP makes it extremely difficult for a new party to challenge. Yes, the coalitions which comprise the Conservatives and Labour are unstable and in Labour’s case, obviously rotting from within. But the answer for the SDP must be to work harder, think harder, finance harder, and build our way back. Rather that than slide into the bosses chair at the expense of propping up the status quo.\nInteresting article, but written in May 2021 -‐ and “a week is a long time in politics”. And while FPTP has been around for a very long time in the UK and other Anglophone countries, it is surely worth a mention what sweeping powers were conferred on a system of elective dictatorship in 2019 with an 80 seat “landslide majority” for 43.6 percent of the vote — to be used during a global pandemic. Our unrepresentative and undemocratically elected Tory government has staggered on, until it sank under its own corruption.",

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_the-cost-of-living-crisis-was-years-in-the-making/content_56.html": "The cost-of-living crisis and the inflationary surge which has accompanied it came as a surprise only to professional economists who – almost universally – failed to predict it. Having been unable to anticipate the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, we shouldn’t be surprised that most economists repeated their performance this year.\nYet basic economics can tell us much about why people are facing rising prices and crushing costs, and what can be done about it. The origins of the ‘heat or eat’ dilemma now facing some British households lie in how sectors such as energy and housing are structured. In particular, the root of the problem can be traced to an aversion by successive governments to long-term planning.\nThe crisis in Britain’s energy sector emerged a few months ago when price spikes in the wholesale gas market caused some supply companies to go bust. This event revealed a fundamental weakness in how our energy market is organised. In the UK countless energy firms operate as intermediaries between producers and consumers and compete for customers on price.\nWe’re encouraged to think of this as competition but, as recent events make clear, energy suppliers who don’t themselves produce energy are simply acting as middlemen. Effectively, they make a bet between energy costs and anticipated revenue and hope to make a margin. It’s unclear what is added by this process, but it has certainly added to the complexity of households obtaining gas and electricity.\nOur establishment parties have designed a structure aimed at fabricating opportunities to make profits instead of concentrating on planning, developing, and producing power to serve the public. As a strategy to make national energy supply less resilient it could hardly be improved upon.\nTo understand how we got here we need to look at causes. Hostility to planning in the utilities sector has been a feature of both Labour and Conservative governments. Much of this is rooted in the free-market ideology which took hold during the Thatcher era and which is based on the naive belief that national strategic planning is unnecessary. Global markets, it is thought, will provide in all circumstances.\nLittle was done to strengthen UK energy resilience in the New Labour years, despite having a unique opportunity afforded by large parliamentary majorities. Blair preferred to squander millions on foolish military intervention in the Middle East rather than to invest to secure Britain’s energy supply.\nIndeed, the ultimate cause of the present surge in energy prices was Labour’s failure to invest in a new generation of nuclear power stations two decades ago. Domestic nuclear power is not subject to wild market fluctuations, nor complex global supply chains. By contrast, France, which depends on nuclear to provide 70% of its electricity, has been able to limit bill hikes to only 4% this year.\nGovernmental failure in the energy market has been equalled – if not surpassed – in the housing sector and, again, some basic economics can help explain the problem.\nPut simply, demand is increasing – partly because immigration is too high, and partly because of natural population growth – and supply is inadequate because we don’t build enough houses. The result is spiralling housing costs. As the SDP’s recent Green Paper ‘The End of Indifference’ explained, average UK house prices have risen by 160% in real terms since 1996.\nThis is anti-social because a perpetual rise in house prices damages the ability of first-time buyers to own property and prevents young people from starting families. Rental prices have also risen sharply particularly in our largest cities. resulting in reduced living standards and even more delays to family formation.\nLiberal thinkers are inclined to ignore the link between public sector house building capacity and the housing crisis, yet it is plain to see. Since 1979 large-scale state housebuilding has all but collapsed. While the austerity-afflicted post-war governments of Attlee and Macmillan regularly built between 200,000 and 300,000 homes per year, we now build less than 20,000. The role Council housing had in providing affordable homes with stable tenancies seems now to go unrecognised by our political class.\nIn truth, the present cost-of-living crisis has been 25 years in the making. Instead of reversing Thatcherism, Tony Blair embedded it and instilled a complete hostility to long-term planning among the main parties. No amount of tinkering with VAT rates, loan schemes, or price rebates will undo 40 years of hostility to national planning. The short-term, anti-planning bias within our system will only be cured when the establishment parties are removed from power.\nThe Labour and Conservative parties are both unmitigated disasters for British Politics the sooner We are rid of them the better We will be the green crap as David Cameron called it when PM was dreampt up by none other than Red Ed Miliband in the last Labour Government followed on by Cameron Theresa May and presently Boris Johnson, We need to rid ourselves of reliance on Russian and Saudi oil and go into fracking the sdp need to offer a much needed alternative Government",

Britain’s immigration policy must be skills-based, needs-based, legal and subject to democratic control.\n- We will withdraw from the 1951 UN refugee convention, the ECHR and all other international instruments which deny UK border sovereignty. We will promote a new set of international agreements on refugee rights which are fit for purpose, protect genuine refugees and do not facilitate people trafficking and illegality.\n- We will reduce net migration to 50,000 per annum and promote a generation long ‘mass immigration pause’ in the interests of integration and social cohesion. Agreements between key strategic partners may result in selective exemptions if clearly in the national interest.\n- All unsolicited asylum applications via breaches of the UK border will be declined. They will result in immediate repatriation or detention offshore within British Overseas Territories until repatriation can be arranged. The UK will contribute to humanitarian resettlement of genuine refugees by offering 20,000 refugee visas annually to carefully vetted families with children in UN refugee camps or near major conflict zones.\n- A foreign spouse of a UK citizen will not qualify for UK residence if there is evidence that the marriage was entered into primarily to obtain admission to the UK. He or she must also demonstrate good-quality spoken and written English. Family visas will be offered only to direct lineal ancestors or descendants of UK citizens.\n- No person will be offered UK citizenship unless they have spent 7 years resident in the UK with ‘probationary leave to remain’ (PLR) status. While on PLR any indictable offence committed or any act considered materially hostile to Britain’s social peace will result in prompt deportation after a single review by a specialist tribunal.\n- Study visas will be cut by half to approximately 250,000 per annum and only allocated to students with places at accredited universities and colleges.

  "https_sdp_org_uk/https_sdp_org_uk_sdptalk_arts-policy-should-return-to-keynes-vision/content_160.html": "During the Second World War, the British Government set up a remarkable organisation called The Committee for Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) to organise artistic and cultural activities for the population.\nThe economist John Maynard Keynes was CEMA’s first and only chairman – and played a major role in drafting the charter of the body that would continue as its peacetime equivalent: The Arts Council.\nIn an essay for The Listener magazine entitled The Arts Council: Its Policy and Hopes (now available as an appendix to The Arts Council of Great Britain’s first Annual Report, 1945), Keynes explained his approach:\nThe task of an official body is not to teach or to censor, but to give courage, confidence and opportunity. Artists depend on the world they live in and the spirit of the age. There is no reason to suppose that less native genius is born into the world in the ages empty of achievement than in those brief periods when nearly all we most value has been brought to birth. New work will spring up more abundantly in unexpected quarters and in unforeseen shapes when there is a universal opportunity for contact with traditional and contemporary arts in their noblest forms. But do not think of the Arts Council as a schoolmaster. Your enjoyment will be our first aim.\nCompare this to Arts Council England’s 2020-2030 strategy document, Let’s Create:\nBy 2030, we want England to be a country in which the creativity of each of us is valued and given the chance to flourish, and where every one of us has access to a remarkable range of high-quality cultural experiences.\nSetting aside the poetic loss of language that has been replaced by bland business plan-speak, we also have a downward spiral as modern day publicly funded bodies drop the words “art” and “artist” from their visions, prioritising ideas like how everyone is creative and culture should be accessible to everybody. The artist is placed into a banal, utilitarian role as ‘a creative’, a cultural provider or practitioner who gives administrators what they want.\nArts and culture policy has been going this way for decades now. The current strategy explicitly advocates that all creative expression should be nurtured and developed, irrespective of quality. This notion of embedding and empowering creativity with missionary zeal goes hand-in-hand with quantifiable outcomes that are meant to address historical imbalances, with promotion of “environmental responsibility, inclusivity and relevance” that represents “the diversity of this country”, while supporting leaders who will work in ways that are “valuable to, and valued by, their communities, creative practitioners and partners.”\nThe idea of the artist here is that of a sort of community leader-educator who is embedded within institutions and whose role is to pass on the cultural Establishment’s favoured messaging.\nIn Keynes’ terms, Arts Council England has become a ‘schoolmaster’, with school prefects running its funded institutions, able to censor critical voices that question or don’t fit into the current political activist zeitgeist.\nIn publicly-funded cultural institutions, censorship, self-censorship, pedantic messaging and what has become known as ‘cancel culture’ have become rife.\nA recent example concerns the planned retrospective exhibition of American painter Philip Guston at Tate Modern for 2021, which has now been postponed until 2024 due to issues with a series of paintings depicting Klu Klux Klan hooded figures. The reason given by the exhibition’s American partner museum for the postponement is that the public is not properly able to read the work and will therefore have to wait “until a time at which we think that the powerful message of social and racial justice that is at the center of Philip Guston’s work can be more clearly interpreted”.\nIn other words, the curators need to teach us how the works must be read, at a later date which they deem politically convenient.\nCancel Culture, spurred on by a small but vocal minority of identity-activists on social media and endorsed by cultural leaders of some funded arts organisations, has attempted to silence writers and artists who question issues relating to race or gender identity. Meanwhile other cultural institutions turn a blind eye to the unjust witch-hunt of critical voices.\nIn my view it is time for arts funding policy to get back to Keynes’ original purpose: not as a regression to the past, but as a series of practical actions with artistic freedom and autonomy at the centre.\nI propose the following:\n- Review the respective national Arts Council funding policies to end divisive and exclusive race, gender, intersectional ‘diversity’ strategies and replace them with values and ideals that promote universalism, support the working class, celebrate and appreciate both traditional and contemporary British culture, while fostering international cooperation and experimentation.\n- Support artistic talent by offering bursaries and grants directly to individuals, small independent clubs, charities, community groups and societies.\n- Public funds to cultural, arts organisations and individuals will be conditional on agreeing to uphold free speech, freedom of expression and free association. Practices by cultural institutions and leaders of censoring artefacts, opinions or cancelling individuals for expressing other points of view are antithetical to British values of tolerance and open-mindedness and any censoring of artists and arts workers should not be tolerated and may lead to the withdrawal of funding.\nAs Keynes wrote, “the work of the artist in all its aspects is, of its nature, individual and free, undisciplined, unregimented, uncontrolled. The artist walks where the breath of the spirit blows him. He cannot be told his direction; he does not know it himself. But he leads the rest of us into fresh pastures and teaches us to love and to enjoy what we often begin by rejecting, enlarging our sensibility and purifying our instincts.”\nThis is the sort of vision I think we should embrace.\nCaption and courtesy information:\nPhilip Guston\nRiding Around\n1969\nOil on canvas\n137.2 x 200.7 cm / 54 x 79 in\n© The Estate of Philip Guston, courtesy Hauser & Wirth\nPrivate Collection\nPhoto: Genevieve Hanson\nGreat piece and absolutely right Manick. Artistic freedom is paramount to creativity. While political interference will, ultimately, produce rotten art it’s also true that artists must be able to live. I’m sure Patrick O’Flynn would agree with the sentiment in The Jam’s All Mod Cons:\n“Artistic freedom, do what you want\nBut just make sure that the money ain’t gone”\nThanks for reminding me of that song by The Jam!\nExcellent\nA fine basis for the formulation of an SDP Arts Policy.\nTim Griffiths, Chairman of SDP West Midlands Region, and one time founding member of the Leamington Studio Artists organisation. (One of the original four, and original administrator.)\nI agree completely.\nGlad I’m not alone in my views. I think the Arts Council should be abolished in its current form\nRead David Lee, of The Jackdaw, and get him to advise on Arts policy.\nI do not know Timothy Griffiths, but as a practising visual artist for over sixty years, an SDP Member and, as it happens, a former Member of Leamington Studio Artists, I completely endorse his and William Clouston’s comments.\nI tweeted recently that the arts, for so long the home of outsiders, iconoclasts and non-conformists devoted to truth, beauty and the search for meaning, is now a chapter of the establishment, a cornerstone of woke orthodoxy, and as predicable as lettuce.\nIts recovery starts here.\nHowever, I suspect the seeds of today’s problems were sown back in Keynes’ time, by a paternalistic elite different to today’s but not *that* different, and one turbo-charged by a democratising spirit that, for all its good intentions, led to the compromising of our critical faculties, toleration of lack of rigour, and rewards for charlatans.\nFor as long as we are content to amuse and distract ourselves this way, it’s not easy to see how we row back from that.\nGovernment should keep out of much as\nthings as possible https://www.saveourrights.uk\nYour third proposal is a much needed response to today’s cancel culture.\nWhilst what Manick Govinda has written is true of the arts, it should also be read as applicable to our whole society. We should have free and uncensored expression but subject to ‘light touch’ government supervision to ensure that we do not damage each other mentally or physically.\nIf you want to see what censorship of any form of art does , you only need to look at what was produced under Hitler and Stalin to see how barren it was.\nThree bold principles being advocated which signal a more confident and grown up approach to how culture might be supported and promoted…this insightful contribution is very welcome.\nAgreed.\nThis policy, and the example of what amounts to the officially prescribed ‘sole’ and ‘correct’ accompanying interpreration of Guston’s art by an apparently uniquely qualified intellectual elite before it can be fully revealed to and appreciated by the unwashed, ignorant masses, worryingly points to a far broader societal problem here.\nVery much so.\nArt is about ideas, not about ideology, and should be free from any a priori obligation to to exist as art, per se.\nArt becomes compromised immediately it becomes a slave to, or a vehicle for propaganda or dogma.\nCompletely agree. What is the point of an artist if he/she is showing us something that we already know or believe? As Keynes says, the object of public support for the arts is to stimulate the “unexpected” and the “unforseen”.\nGreat article. I’m currently ploughing my way through an arts council application for a small grant, so much of this resonates, particualy the current need to tick the identity boxes. I’m quite sure this is off-putting to a large number of artists who’ve no interest in playing that game, or they do the total opposite and say /do whatever it takes to get the money. Either way, neither is a good outcome.\nHowever, as someone who works in the arts, I’m not adverse to being made accountable for public money being granted to me, though, it’s certainly debabtle about what and how that accountability is derermined.\nIf so, the SDP ought to promote The Jackdaw and it’s editor David Lee.\nThis is an excellent opinion piece and should be taken up by those in the Arts Council. It’s wise simply wise.\nI speak as an individual but have been Vice Chair of the National Theatre Development Council so I recognise the attitudes of many in the theatre world, which would be at odds with this view, since many of them are happy to support such causes.\nI fully support the views in this article and its philosophy is relevant not only to the arts but all fields, as one contributor to the comments points out. The Arts Council reflects the so-called liberal views of the vociferous which they believe is the majority. I do not believe these are the views of most citizens but they dare not voice their objections. I support the SDP because I believe it’s views do reflect the beliefs of this majority. I would go further in establishing the party as the one which believes above all in careful consideration of the facts before proposing solutions and stressing that we are a party of common sense, a feature that has been so lacking during this epidemic.\nAs an example of such factual deliberation, let us take climate change. Our declaration states “We believe the UK must lead by example in being at the forefront of global action to combat climate change” No matter what one’s opinion is of the danger, it deserves more consideration of its imminence and the proposed actions to counter it. Being at the forefront is not a sensible action when China is building so many coal fired generating facilities. We should ask our supporters and others in general whether a statement like the following might be more reasonable and it would certainly distance us from the other parties. No-one who feels the situation is far too alarmist and the solutions proposed too damaging to the economy and particularly the poor, has anywhere to go politically. So, how about something like this.\n“We believe that solutions proposed to alleviate the potential damage by climate change must be examined having regard to both the validity, the urgency and the economic impact of such measures.”\nThis does not state an absolute position as to the truth of the alarm generated by the likes of Greta Thumberg and Lord Attenborough but, if it is shown to appeal to the wider populace we would be the only party for them to support.\nhe lumping together if all these",
