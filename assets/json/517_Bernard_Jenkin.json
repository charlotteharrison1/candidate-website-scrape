It is insufferable for the residents of Dedham and the surrounding towns and villages, and the roads authorities must grip this as soon as possible.\nWhile works carried out by National Highways implement vital and long called improvements, I am conscious of ensuring that they're carried out with the least disruption and that local authorities fulfil their responsibility for clearing litter.\nYou can find out more about what I've been doing on this campaign below.",

They are working incredibly hard to manage a huge demand and we need to remember that the kindness of patients and other stakeholders goes a long way towards improving staff morale and staff retention, especially in light of the practice's ever growing patient list.\nOne solution would be to utilise the underused Minor Injuries Unit at Dovercourt's Fryatt Hospital and I will continue to engage and work with the practice and other local NHS stakeholders to identify and secure a long-term solution.\nYou can find out more about what I've been doing on this campaign below.",

We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition.
