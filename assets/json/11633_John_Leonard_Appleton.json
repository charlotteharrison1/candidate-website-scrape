  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_05_12_desert-island-books/content_184.html": "Desert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.\nDesert Island Albums « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 20, 2012 at 3:41 pm\n[…] I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The […]",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_05_03_the-2015-general-election/content_11.html": "The 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_04_24_paulo-di-canio-and-feminism/content_224.html": "Paulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_07_23_flipping-genders/content_217.html": "Flipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_animals/content_2.html": "Deaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nGull Lover’s Travails.\nI have nothing against animal rights, nor indeed against those who wish to be nice to all things great and small. Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening. I’m hoping this won’t be the case.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_11_08_poppies-and-the-england-team/content_228.html": "Poppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.\nHave your say!",

You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_sexism/content_88.html": "Ruth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nFlipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nSlutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.",

Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.\nDesert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.\nApples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nA Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nRetrospection\nIt’s been a hell of a year, if I’m honest. There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nRetrospection\nSo, farewell then, 2010, as E. J. Thribb might say. The year has been good fun, with mostly plus points. So for those who might be interested, here’s my 2010 summed up,\nJanuary: As per the previous two years, January was pantomime month with the Washington Theatre Group. This year saw me playing the downtrodden Blue Peter in Peter Pan: The Revenge of Hook.\nFebruary: Thought I’d give ballet a try (watching, not doing), in the shape of The Nutcracker, full of music I already thought wonderful. And I’d definitely see some again.\nMarch: A trip to the South coast to see the Tiger Lillies in Brighton with Billie and Jen. I must visit Brighton again one day.\nApril: A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies in a recorded showing of Shockheaded Peter at The V&A. The Lillies also made a trip to Durham, so I could see them without having to travel more than 20 miles.\nMay: Joined the Green Party, shortly after Caroline Lucas became their first MP. Tried vegetarianism for a week.\nJune: ROCKY HORROR! And Nigel actually remembers this one. Will wonders never cease?\nJuly: Welcome to the Jungle with the WTG, playing a couch potato and a doberman (“Strong, naturally dominant, fanatically loyal, and of course, highly intelligent” – just like me, then). One of the plays was also my inaugural attempt at directing. I’ve never been so nervous in the theatre as when that play was first performed.\nAugust: Much hilarity as a scorpion is found at the Arts Centre Washington and the place is closed for two days. Oh, for those halcyon days in Botswana when even a kid getting stung by a scorpion wouldn’t have the school closed for five minutes.\nSeptember: Plenty of theatre this month: Apples, Hairspray, The King & I and Blithe Spirit.\nOctober: Failed a driving test, but passed a stand-up comedy test after doing a turn for the Sunderland Green Party. Hopefully, it won’t be a the last.\nNovember: Performing at the Royalty in Journey’s End – great fun to do, and the moustache will live on in legend.\nDecember: Begun rehearsals of Macbeth at the Royalty, in some small but fun parts.\nBring on 2011.\nStand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nRetrospection\nMore an excuse to make a post than anything else, really. A quick review of the fun stuff this year.\nJanuary: Snow White and the Magic Mirror with the Washington Theatre Group. I still think I owe some revenge upon who thought up the final night trick they played on me.\nFebruary: Not fun. Moving swiftly on…\nMarch: The renewal of an old acquaintance that would have an effect on my thoughts on politics, my confidence, and led to a greater appreciation of poetry and music from a participative perspective. Say that twenty times fast.\nApril: Three birthday parties.\nMay: London, Manchester, Sunderland, London and Harrogate were where I spent Saturday nights – Enjoying the Tiger Lillies, Rebecca Newman, The Fab Café and Breathing Corpses at the Royalty.\nJune: Playing four parts in The Graduate at the Royalty.\nJuly: Visits to the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery.\nAugust: Hanging around South London for a change. And a first full weekend at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nSeptember: Manchester weekend of pink and blackness.\nOctober: Grized Ale, a lovely Lake District beer. A weekend in the Lake District, with no lakes. But that didn’t spoil it. And, a paid acting job. Thirty whole quid.\nNovember: The month of the housewarming party, of which there were two. And I had to go and resort to gin, didn’t I?\nDecember: First niece, Eloise Jennifer, born. A fifth London trip, and one to York. And, I think, a first completion of an Araucaria crossword.\nGood year, all told.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_page_3/content_106.html": "Nude Glorious Nude\n(Oliver-based title pun, ‘cos the production currently at Newcastle Theatre Royal is very worth seeing. But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.\nRid of You\nSo, this is the film what I made last year. Enjoy.\nUpdate: The video’s been removed; I’ll keep an eye out to see if it appears again.\nNorth-East Skinny Dip\nYes. You read that right. Hopefully it’ll be a world record for the biggest number of naked idiots jumping into the sea at once. That’s gotta be worth a few sponsorship pounds.\nThe North-East Skinny Dip is taking place on Saturday 22nd September at very silly o’clock in the morning, in the North Sea (see idiots comment earlier). We’re doing it for a very worthy charity (MIND, a national mental health charity), as well as for an cracking answer to the question, “So, done anything interesting lately?”. I think it’s difficult to beat.\nBut here’s the important bit where I try to get you to part with your hard-earned: There’s a single sponsorship page (under one person’s name, but it all goes to the same charity), so that we don’t all have to mess about with creating hundreds of JustGiving pages (and so that if you know more than one of us but want to sponsor us all, that’s easier). Anyway, to make the sponsorship link nice and easy to spot, here it is in stupidly big format:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nThanks in advance if you do choose to donate some cash to this very worthy cause. Alternatively, if you’d actually like to take part, the registration site is here (and see the link to the Facebook event page above – invite your friends – or your enemies). Wish us luck!\nApples on Tour – The Northumbrian Coast\nThere are three principal reasons that I think the North of England rocks. These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches. Next year, perhaps…\nFaster, Higher, Stranger\nThe Olympics continues to generate mixed feelings for me. Not so much the impending London Olympiad, more the whole concept of it. Or at least, what it has become.\nFact is, I love the idea of it. That the finest athletes from a round the globe can descend upon one city and give a showcase of their sport, and sport in general. Sport is an important thing; it is to the physical what science is to the mental, and what art is to the emotional. It can be as inspirational as science or art, and can promote confidence and team work just as much as science and art. It also has the obvious health benefits. To advertise sport on a global level, as the Olympics no doubt does, is therefore a good thing.\nThis idea of it being a celebration of elite sport, and perhaps sportsmanship, is one that has always been handed to us, by the media and society. And that’s how I viewed it when I first encountered the Olympics. That was the Seoul Olympiad of 1998, when I was ten. My single memory of that is Ben Johnson’s disqualification for the use of steroids. Completely against the idea of sportsmanship, obviously, but the disqualification seemed to me to show that sportsmanship was the central value of the Olympics. Transgressors would be found and punished, and sporting integrity would reign supreme once more.\nThe 1992 and 1996 Olympics, as far as my teenage self was concerned, were also good, enjoyable sporting events that showcased sport, and presented it in the right light. Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell shone in 1992, and it proved to me for the first time how good the Olympics was at highlighting fringe sports. I have memories of watching Simon Terry win bronze for Britain in the Archery (he’s back this year, too). I’m sure around this period, the Winter Olympics had me hooked on Curling as well.\nBut as we went through the games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing, things seemed to change. More and more, athletes were being caught by the doping people. These would often be followed by denials, rightly or wrongly. In any case, the amount of these cases hardly helped the Olympics to retain its reputation for sportsmanship.\nAnd as we’ve become accustomed in this day and age, the sponsorship seems to be increasingly ludicrous. Official thises-and-thats of each Olympiad take up advertising space in any medium that’ll have it. I’ll not be surprised to see allegations of ambush marketing at London 2012, as we saw in the South Africa World Cup in 2010. And we’ve already heard stories saying that spectators will be searched for their own food and drink before being allowed entry to events.\nWhich brings me to London 2012. From ludicrous ticket pricing systems (computer took ten minutes to tell me a ticket was available for football, THEN told me I’d have to pay £6 for postage. I declined.) to residents of London tower block putting in complaints about artillery being placed on top of their buildings, much of the preparation for this Olympiad has seemed little more than a ridiculous farce. And I’m not confident that this image will be shaken off during or after the games.\nThis said, I’ll no doubt still end up watching a fair bit of it (the Archery schedules have already been bookmarked). The basic principles of the Olympics, or what I considered them to be, will not entirely have dissipated. We will still have top class athletes who want fair competition, so it seems unfair to deny them the chance to show us their capabilities just because the powers that be might have porridge for brains. Unfortunately, when you have fools at the top, their foolishness blinds them from their foolishness, so it might be a while before things change. Oh well.\nAlan Turing’s Centenary\nHe might have been 100 this coming weekend. You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.\nUsquebaugh\nIn the spirit (pun intended) of my last blog, I expect you to memorise it. Detention for those who don’t.\nUsquebaugh\nThe room is dark, the record player goes.\nMy sofa welcomes me with open arms.\nI lift the glass, and hold it to my nose,\nAnd breathe its heavy, dark and peaty charms.\nI drop it to my mouth and take a sip –\nIt stings my lips and slowly warms my throat.\nMy mind’s transported on a whisky trip,\nUpon a glassy, icy sailing boat.\nAnd with each drink, I’m further out to sea,\nThe Captain of a malty pleasure cruise.\nNo mates, no crew, a voyage just for me,\nTo sail the seven seas of Scottish booze.\n‘Til all at once, the final drop is gone –\nI think I’ll have to get another one!\n© John Appleton 2011\nPoetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nEuro 2012 and Racism\nThe main element of bad press for Euro 2012 at the moment is racism. Not so much the whole John Terry/Rio Ferdinand story (personally, I’d have left both of them out of the squad; they’re past it now in my opinion); more the attitudes of the Polish and Ukrainian supporters. Racist attitudes, that is, of the sort that hasn’t been seen (to any great extent, at least) in English football since the 80s.\nAmong the numerous stories, we have players saying that they, or their whole teams, will leave the pitch if they receive racist abuse. We have Michel Platini stating that players will be booked if they do that (I believe that referees can book players for leaving the pitch without permission anyway). He’s had his critics for this, as one might expect – such a stance will always look soft on racism. But I’m not entirely sure that leaving the pitch (or indeed the entire tournament, as some have suggested) is the right thing to do. Let me explain.\nI’ll try to put this in some perspective first. Footballers will always, rightly or wrongly, receive abuse from fans. Indeed, I dished some out in my last blog post (though I would hope it’s taken as being tongue-in-cheek). And it needn’t be racist abuse. It might be to do with nationality, height, (perceived) sexuality, religion, weight, hair colour, criminal convictions, their invented illegitimacy, anything. Race is just one of these things. It just so happens that, for whatever reason, the general public in this country are more sensitive to racial abuse than to other forms – even though other forms of abuse can be taken to heart to the same extent that racism can be.\nBecause racism is seen to be worse, a footballer can be banned for numerous matches because of a racist taunt (as Luis Suárez was, for eight games, this season). But I’ve yet to see a player banned for any other sort of taunt to another player, and you’d have to be a fool to think that it doesn’t happen. Fans, too, can get bans or criminal convictions for racist abuse, but not for other forms. Players will make official complaints where racial taunting goes on, but again, not for other forms of abuse. On those occasions, they’d be expected to not let the abuse get to them, and to carry on the game as normal – whether the abuse comes from players or fans.\nIn my opinion, that’s the right attitude to take – don’t let it get to you. As children, we’re taught mantras such as “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We’re told to disregard bullies, as a reaction is exactly what they want. The racism problem of Euro 2012 is simply playground bullying writ large. Those handing out the abuse (who were probably the bullies in the playground, and probably haven’t grown up much since), whether players or fans, are looking for a reaction. They want to disrupt the rightful order of things for their own entertainment or gain. By giving a reaction, the racists are getting what they want. And if games are abandoned, we’d be punishing innocent people – those fans who have spent large amounts of flights, hotels, tickets, et cetera. The racists have their fun, the true fans lose their money and a chance to see their team, and the sports stars deny themselves their right to compete at the highest level in the continent. How can this be right in any way?\nThe point is this. Platini’s stance makes it sound like he wants to ignore racism entirely (and he might – I don’t exactly know him personally). But there’s a difference between ignoring something, and not allowing it to affect you. Teams certainly cannot ignore racism – but they can keep a cool head, maintain the moral high ground, and not allow the bastards to grind them down. The complaints can be made after the game, and we’d have to trust UEFA (I know that might be difficult) to mete out punishments to the FAs or clubs involved (as they did with Liverpool after the Heysel disaster). Theoretically, that should see the right people punished – not the true fans or the players.\nEuro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_tumbleweed/content_46.html": "Night of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_food/content_6.html": "National Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_about/content_123.html": "About\nMy name is John and I live in Sunderland, England, having lived in various parts of North-east England and Southern Africa. My prime passion is theatre, both seeing it and doing amateur dramatics, presently with two companies. My other interests include poetry, writing, comedy, cruciverbalism, art, and football. Politically, I believe in libertarian, egalitarian, socialist, envrionmentalist and disestablishmentarianist, and am a member of the Green Party. Religion-wise, I’m a neopagan.\nThe title of this blog comes from a Manic Street Preachers song of the same name, one of the last written by Richey Edwards before his disappearance. In addition to the words invoking a fabulous gothic image, the songs contains some appropriate lyrics:\nOnce you roared, now you just grunt lame,\nPace around pathetic pound games.\nProphetic, given that the Manics were a frenetic, vitriolic and energetic band before Richey disappeared – after which, they became, unfortunately, a bit of a sell-out.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_books/content_142.html": "Desert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.\nA Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_poetry/content_25.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now. Anyway, in honour of the recent North-East Skinny Dip, an Anacreontic ode (good for upbeat celebration of something so free-spirited) on the fun we had…\nEau Naturel\nTwenty-second of September!\nWhat a morning to remember!\nScores of people in the nip,\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\nThere we stood at Druridge Bay,\nAt the very break of day.\nWaiting on the icy sand,\nDipping hour close at hand.\nFinally we got the call:\n“Okay, dippers – bear it all!”\nOff it came, right then and there,\nEverybody’s underwear.\nLiberated from our clothes,\nOff we ran, with frozen toes\nStraight into the foaming brine,\nAs the sun began to shine.\nHordes of people filled the sea,\nIn the name of charity.\nMen and women, young and old,\nBody sizes manifold.\nDodging waves, we swam about,\nFree and easy, wearing nowt.\nAll around were laughs and hoots,\nFrom the folk in birthday suits.\nProud to show their naked forms,\nChallenging the social norms.\nNot a body part seemed rude,\nWith so many in the nude.\nOnce we all had swum enough,\nOut we stumbled, in the buff.\nClothed and warm, we got some scran\nFrom the handy burger van.\nThis much needed body heat\nPut some feeling in my feet.\nBack home, I was pleased to find\nLoads of money raised for Mind;\nTV, radio and papers\nCovering our naked capers.\nBest of all, I think I’ve grown,\nChallenging my comfort zone –\nFor I’d had the guts to strip\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\n© John Appleton 2012\nUsquebaugh\nIn the spirit (pun intended) of my last blog, I expect you to memorise it. Detention for those who don’t.\nUsquebaugh\nThe room is dark, the record player goes.\nMy sofa welcomes me with open arms.\nI lift the glass, and hold it to my nose,\nAnd breathe its heavy, dark and peaty charms.\nI drop it to my mouth and take a sip –\nIt stings my lips and slowly warms my throat.\nMy mind’s transported on a whisky trip,\nUpon a glassy, icy sailing boat.\nAnd with each drink, I’m further out to sea,\nThe Captain of a malty pleasure cruise.\nNo mates, no crew, a voyage just for me,\nTo sail the seven seas of Scottish booze.\n‘Til all at once, the final drop is gone –\nI think I’ll have to get another one!\n© John Appleton 2011\nPoetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nVoices\nBeen a while since I posted. Time for a poem, I think.\nVoices\nI have some voices in my head\nThat tell me what to do.\nTheir names are Jub, and Flib, and Xed,\nThere’s Grimp and Weeble, too.\nOne day the voices said to me,\n“Hey Johnny, listen close,\nYou have to make a cup of tea,\nAnd then some buttered toast”.\nSo off I went to make my drink,\nObedient and dumb,\nI never even stopped to think\nWhat harm to me might come.\nBut ‘cos the tea had been so nice,\nThe voices gained my trust.\nEach day I’d hear from them twice,\nDid what they said I must.\nBut then one fateful day, they said,\n“Hey Johnny, listen here:\nYou must shoot someone in the head,\nAnd we’ll give you some beer.”\nI found a gun with perfect ease.\nAnd then a victim, too.\nI gave the trigger such a squeeze\nIt turned my fingers blue.\nThe fellow’s brains went everywhere,\nThe room was red as hell.\nThe took me into special care –\nA private padded cell.\nNow you might ask me if I rue\nThe mess that got me here.\nAnd I would say, “Of course I do –\nI never got the beer!”\n© John Appleton 2010\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nThe Zombie King\nI’m quite liking the sestina verse form – the same six words (or syllables) are used, in a specific pattern, to end the lines of each stanza, and also have a specific placing in the envoi. It’s like poetic sudoku. Here’s a vague attempt…\nThe Zombie King\nIt was a dark and stormy night,\nAnd shuffling in his earthy grave,\nThe figure of the Zombie King\nWas baying for a feast of blood.\nThe Grand High Priest of all the dead\nWould soon arise to seek his prey.\n‘Twas weeks since last he’d taken prey;\nAt last, a storm had come that night.\nThe wet ground stirred the Evil Dead,\nand made them restless in the grave.\nAnd one was hungry for some blood:\nIt was, of course, the Zombie King.\nAnd on the prowl, the Zombie King\nAt last had spotted tasty prey.\nA pure soul, whose virgin blood\nWould be a feast to make his night.\nThe girl stood by her father’s grave,\nAnd cried, and wished he wasn’t dead.\nBut now the Lord of all Undead,\nThe evil, mindless Zombie King,\nCrept silently toward the grave,\nWith eyes set firmly on his prey.\nIt was to be her final night;\nHe licked his lips: at last, some blood!\nHe pounced on her, it chilled her blood.\nHer screams amused the living dead,\nWhose laughter echoed through the night.\nAnd while she lay there, panicking,\nShe had one choice: to hope and pray\nShe wouldn’t die on Daddy’s grave.\nHe pinned his victim to the grave,\nWith yellow fangs he drew her blood.\nA tasty meal, his virgin prey,\nAnd soon the hapless girl was dead.\nA triumph for the Zombie King,\nUpon that dark and stormy night.\nBack in the grave, the Evil Dead\nWere drunk on blood, and hailed their King,\nAnd prayed for more another night.\n© John Appleton 2009\nLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate…\nRight, just a random post to establish some sort of presence. There will be something with actual substance posted later.\nBy way of an explanation, the title here is apparently from the original Italian of Dante’s Divine Comedy. “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” Possibly more portentous than need be, but they can both be recited in iambic pentameter if you try hard enough.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_05/content_89.html": "National Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.\nThe 2010 General Election\nIt feels like there’s something important about tomorrow’s General Election. Perhaps it’s simply because over the past year or so, I’ve been more acutely aware of politics in Britain, and indeed the world. Not just from a point of view of Westminster/Capitol Hill, but also from a point of view of the grass roots of society, and how they’re treated by the higher classes. Perhaps it’s because there have been some major events that transcended the purely political and the ordinary – The economic crisis is seen on the streets, it’s talked of in Whitehall as a major issue. Barrack Obama’s healthcare reforms have divided America, from the unemployed to the whatever the US might consider their aristocracy. Perhaps, it’s just because we look like we’re in for a change of government, and for the first time I can remember, it’s not just a two-horse race. The Liberal Democrats appear to have got a foot in the door, and from a Northeast perspective, I’m seeing the Greens field more candidates than I can recall in a previous election.\nMy personal politics have swung sharply to the left over the last year – see the earlier post on The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists for at least one reason. The book was an eye-opener for me, not just to left-wing politics, but also, indirectly, to other spheres of alternative culture – social justice and sustainability, to name a couple. The Greens, therefore, should be the party for whom I’m voting. Alas, the good old First-Past-The-Post system ensures that I, and doubtless many other Northeasterners who aren’t lucky enough to live on Tyneside, cannot show the support to this party that I’d wish. It’s at least thankful that I do have this option in the local elections, also taking place tomorrow.\nSo to whom will I be giving my support?\nThe Conservative Party have appeared, over this campaign, to be the antithesis of what I believe in. David Cameron rarely appears to be genuine; merely a person who knows what to say, but only when it’s scripted and he’s been able to prepare. In thinking on his feet, he has faltered. He might have some talent for rhetoric, scrub up well, and look the part – but there’s a word for that – Acting. Sure, he’s good at it, but that’s not the mark of a statesperson. More to the point, I’m not a capitalist. “Traditional values” are not something that I prize for the sake of tradition. I care not for fox-hunting; I don’t want its ban repealed. I care not for marriage, and the Conservative plans to put marriage on a pedestal in the tax system are unfair to both those who don’t wish to be married, and to those who find relationships difficult to obtain or sustain. The terrible truth is that such people are left to feel bad about themselves when marriage is promoted as the good, proper thing to do.\nFurthermore, the nature of the Conservatives’ attitude to sexual freedom has been widely criticised over the campaign, not least because of this person, which was only one of many stories in the press showing Conservatives, some very senior, to be fairly homophobic. I can only hope this hasn’t gone unnoticed by too many.\nThe Labour Party have had thirteen years to change the country, after promising the same for four General Elections. It wasn’t a surprise that they won in 1997 – a whole generation of voters had grown up under Conservative rule, which became increasingly unpopular, and the relatively young, energetic persona of Tony Blair was always going to defeat the grey-faced, dull image of John Major, whatever you may have thought of either. But the Blairite (or perhaps Blair-Right) politics of New Labour looked distinctly Conservative, so no major change occurred. But this had been on the cards, some might have felt, after the removal of Clause IV from Labour’s constitution, which saw the party move from being one with explicit socialist aims, to one paying mere lip-service to the working classes. Thirteen years with no change. Or perhaps that’s not true. In 1997 the economy was relatively stable, and we weren’t in any deeply unpopular wars. Change, indeed. So, no vote for Labour either.\nAny party with nationalist agendas (UKIP, the BNP, the National Front, and the English Democrats) will never get my vote. I know well the value of a multicultural society. Those who impugn it are simply, in my opinion, ignorant.\nSo, it’s the Liberal Democrats. Something of a protest vote, something of a tactical vote, something of a belief that the two main parties are resembling the pigs and farmers at the end of Animal Farm, and something does need to change. It maybe that a Liberal government would end up not offering such; in fact, if the television debates have changed my mind about anything, it’s that Nick Clegg appears as scripted as the other two leaders. But without the Green option, it appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament, and all that really changes is the voting system, as some commentators have speculated.\nBut in spirit, I’ll be backing the Green Party.",

These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches.

Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop. No time to visit Anfield, unfortunately, but I did at least get to watch Liverpool’s penalty shoot-out win in the League Cup Final. Come on you Reds.\nSo, I have not been disappointed by this eagerly-awaited trip. There’s probably a lot more to discover about Liverpool, as there always will be with any place. So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_green-party/content_43.html": "The 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nApples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west.

Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one.

So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.\nStand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nThe 2010 General Election\nIt feels like there’s something important about tomorrow’s General Election. Perhaps it’s simply because over the past year or so, I’ve been more acutely aware of politics in Britain, and indeed the world. Not just from a point of view of Westminster/Capitol Hill, but also from a point of view of the grass roots of society, and how they’re treated by the higher classes. Perhaps it’s because there have been some major events that transcended the purely political and the ordinary – The economic crisis is seen on the streets, it’s talked of in Whitehall as a major issue. Barrack Obama’s healthcare reforms have divided America, from the unemployed to the whatever the US might consider their aristocracy. Perhaps, it’s just because we look like we’re in for a change of government, and for the first time I can remember, it’s not just a two-horse race. The Liberal Democrats appear to have got a foot in the door, and from a Northeast perspective, I’m seeing the Greens field more candidates than I can recall in a previous election.\nMy personal politics have swung sharply to the left over the last year – see the earlier post on The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists for at least one reason. The book was an eye-opener for me, not just to left-wing politics, but also, indirectly, to other spheres of alternative culture – social justice and sustainability, to name a couple. The Greens, therefore, should be the party for whom I’m voting. Alas, the good old First-Past-The-Post system ensures that I, and doubtless many other Northeasterners who aren’t lucky enough to live on Tyneside, cannot show the support to this party that I’d wish. It’s at least thankful that I do have this option in the local elections, also taking place tomorrow.\nSo to whom will I be giving my support?\nThe Conservative Party have appeared, over this campaign, to be the antithesis of what I believe in. David Cameron rarely appears to be genuine; merely a person who knows what to say, but only when it’s scripted and he’s been able to prepare. In thinking on his feet, he has faltered. He might have some talent for rhetoric, scrub up well, and look the part – but there’s a word for that – Acting. Sure, he’s good at it, but that’s not the mark of a statesperson. More to the point, I’m not a capitalist. “Traditional values” are not something that I prize for the sake of tradition. I care not for fox-hunting; I don’t want its ban repealed. I care not for marriage, and the Conservative plans to put marriage on a pedestal in the tax system are unfair to both those who don’t wish to be married, and to those who find relationships difficult to obtain or sustain. The terrible truth is that such people are left to feel bad about themselves when marriage is promoted as the good, proper thing to do.\nFurthermore, the nature of the Conservatives’ attitude to sexual freedom has been widely criticised over the campaign, not least because of this person, which was only one of many stories in the press showing Conservatives, some very senior, to be fairly homophobic. I can only hope this hasn’t gone unnoticed by too many.\nThe Labour Party have had thirteen years to change the country, after promising the same for four General Elections. It wasn’t a surprise that they won in 1997 – a whole generation of voters had grown up under Conservative rule, which became increasingly unpopular, and the relatively young, energetic persona of Tony Blair was always going to defeat the grey-faced, dull image of John Major, whatever you may have thought of either. But the Blairite (or perhaps Blair-Right) politics of New Labour looked distinctly Conservative, so no major change occurred. But this had been on the cards, some might have felt, after the removal of Clause IV from Labour’s constitution, which saw the party move from being one with explicit socialist aims, to one paying mere lip-service to the working classes. Thirteen years with no change. Or perhaps that’s not true. In 1997 the economy was relatively stable, and we weren’t in any deeply unpopular wars. Change, indeed. So, no vote for Labour either.\nAny party with nationalist agendas (UKIP, the BNP, the National Front, and the English Democrats) will never get my vote. I know well the value of a multicultural society. Those who impugn it are simply, in my opinion, ignorant.\nSo, it’s the Liberal Democrats. Something of a protest vote, something of a tactical vote, something of a belief that the two main parties are resembling the pigs and farmers at the end of Animal Farm, and something does need to change. It maybe that a Liberal government would end up not offering such; in fact, if the television debates have changed my mind about anything, it’s that Nick Clegg appears as scripted as the other two leaders. But without the Green option, it appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament, and all that really changes is the voting system, as some commentators have speculated.\nBut in spirit, I’ll be backing the Green Party.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_05_19_apples-on-tour-south-manchester/content_58.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04_02_las-malvinas-son-whose/content_225.html": "Las Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?\nChris said,\nApril 2, 2012 at 12:19 pm\nThe Falklands War was more about the military junta in Argentina holding on to power than anyone actually wanting the islands. President Galtieri needed a war to keep the head of the the Argentinian navy on-side and his military “dictatorship” in office. That was a damn good reason to fight to keep them in my opinion.\nFast forward to today, and now there’s very little reason to give them up. “Because Argentina wants them” is not a reason to displace the people who live there. Plus, while they might be ‘just a bunch of rocks in the sea’, there are several oil exploration companies (British ones) investigating the possible oil field under them. Like it or not, that’s another good reason to keep them.\noddbodd13 said,\nApril 3, 2012 at 12:53 pm\nThe idea that Argentina may have had a hidden agenda in 1982 wasn’t one that’s really occurred to me, so it’s good to have that perspective – thanks.\nJennieB said,\nApril 2, 2012 at 1:23 pm\n“Finders-keepers-losers-weepers”\nRousseau wrote in Discourse of Inequality (I paraphrase as I can’t remember it straight off): “…the earth belongs to no one”.\nThe idea of ‘sovereignty’ and/or land ownership comes from whomever had the biggest ‘guns’/political cunning. They rid the land of its indigenous people (or main predator), appropriated its fauna and flora, gave the land a name – or broke it up with other names. Countries are a man-made concept; a linguistic conceit. As for settlers: communities formed around areas which had rich soil and rivers, then shaped their community by the evolution of cultures, belief, a surge in a concept called ‘patriotism’.\nAlthough I’m not religious, I’m sure there’s something similar that pre-dates Rousseau in the Bible: about humans belonging to the earth and not the other way around. Funny how politicians who subscribe to religion conveniently forget this.\nThe cynic in me reckons that a ‘war’ – or willy-wangling of weapons – would just be to improve certain politician’s approval levels, and to resurrect pointless jingoistic sentiments.",

Enjoy.\nUpdate: The video’s been removed; I’ll keep an eye out to see if it appears again.\nRetrospection\nIt’s been a hell of a year, if I’m honest. There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nFive Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.\nSoldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!\nRetrospection\nSo, farewell then, 2010, as E. J. Thribb might say. The year has been good fun, with mostly plus points. So for those who might be interested, here’s my 2010 summed up,\nJanuary: As per the previous two years, January was pantomime month with the Washington Theatre Group. This year saw me playing the downtrodden Blue Peter in Peter Pan: The Revenge of Hook.\nFebruary: Thought I’d give ballet a try (watching, not doing), in the shape of The Nutcracker, full of music I already thought wonderful. And I’d definitely see some again.\nMarch: A trip to the South coast to see the Tiger Lillies in Brighton with Billie and Jen. I must visit Brighton again one day.\nApril: A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies in a recorded showing of Shockheaded Peter at The V&A. The Lillies also made a trip to Durham, so I could see them without having to travel more than 20 miles.\nMay: Joined the Green Party, shortly after Caroline Lucas became their first MP. Tried vegetarianism for a week.\nJune: ROCKY HORROR! And Nigel actually remembers this one. Will wonders never cease?\nJuly: Welcome to the Jungle with the WTG, playing a couch potato and a doberman (“Strong, naturally dominant, fanatically loyal, and of course, highly intelligent” – just like me, then). One of the plays was also my inaugural attempt at directing. I’ve never been so nervous in the theatre as when that play was first performed.\nAugust: Much hilarity as a scorpion is found at the Arts Centre Washington and the place is closed for two days. Oh, for those halcyon days in Botswana when even a kid getting stung by a scorpion wouldn’t have the school closed for five minutes.\nSeptember: Plenty of theatre this month: Apples, Hairspray, The King & I and Blithe Spirit.\nOctober: Failed a driving test, but passed a stand-up comedy test after doing a turn for the Sunderland Green Party. Hopefully, it won’t be a the last.\nNovember: Performing at the Royalty in Journey’s End – great fun to do, and the moustache will live on in legend.\nDecember: Begun rehearsals of Macbeth at the Royalty, in some small but fun parts.\nBring on 2011.\nStand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nRetrospection\nMore an excuse to make a post than anything else, really. A quick review of the fun stuff this year.\nJanuary: Snow White and the Magic Mirror with the Washington Theatre Group. I still think I owe some revenge upon who thought up the final night trick they played on me.\nFebruary: Not fun. Moving swiftly on…\nMarch: The renewal of an old acquaintance that would have an effect on my thoughts on politics, my confidence, and led to a greater appreciation of poetry and music from a participative perspective. Say that twenty times fast.\nApril: Three birthday parties.\nMay: London, Manchester, Sunderland, London and Harrogate were where I spent Saturday nights – Enjoying the Tiger Lillies, Rebecca Newman, The Fab Café and Breathing Corpses at the Royalty.\nJune: Playing four parts in The Graduate at the Royalty.\nJuly: Visits to the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery.\nAugust: Hanging around South London for a change. And a first full weekend at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nSeptember: Manchester weekend of pink and blackness.\nOctober: Grized Ale, a lovely Lake District beer. A weekend in the Lake District, with no lakes. But that didn’t spoil it. And, a paid acting job. Thirty whole quid.\nNovember: The month of the housewarming party, of which there were two. And I had to go and resort to gin, didn’t I?\nDecember: First niece, Eloise Jennifer, born. A fifth London trip, and one to York. And, I think, a first completion of an Araucaria crossword.\nGood year, all told.\nArtistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.",

We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2014_08_30_the-scottish-referendum/content_119.html": "The Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_12_20_desert-island-albums/content_38.html": "Desert Island Albums\nOne problem with the whole desert-island-whatever thing is that, if you knew you were going to be stranded, possibly for years, with only about ten records, books, or whatever, you’d have to be pragmatic. Although the idea is that you choose your favourite ten, common sense would suggest otherwise. You’d probably want a bit of variety. You might be a big Led Zeppelin fan, for instance, but surely, for the whole time you were stuck on that island, you wouldn’t want all nine of their studio albums plus a compilation. You’d want something different on occasion. II and IV would probably suffice, possibly with Physical Graffiti if you didn’t think you could live without Kashmir.\nSo, this list of albums isn’t necessarily my 10 favourites. It’s probably closer to a list of favoured artists. I’ve made a few rules for this: firstly, no compilation albums. Greatest Hitses, Very Best Ofs and Now That’s What I Calls all feel a bit like cheating here. Secondly, no box sets, as they similarly feel like they don’t hit the spirit of the thing.\nAnd I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The reserves will be those that, should I find myself about to be stranded on a desert island with my record collection in front of me, I’d take if any of the main ten couldn’t be found. That seems fair. So, in no particular order:\nGeneration Terrorist – Manic Street Preachers\nFor those poor souls who think the Manics’ career began when A Design For Life made it big, let me educate you on something. That single was from their fourth album – which saw the beginning of the band’s slow collapse into nice commercial tunes. Before that, much of their creative genius came from Richey Edwards – a man often described as “troubled” by the press (not without cause – look up the 4 REAL incident), and who is now missing, presumed dead. And this first album might surprise those who so loved the strings and nice, friendly, pop guitars of their Everything Must Go offering. Because it’s brash, and full of anti-establishment sentiment. Motorcycle Emptiness will always be its best-known track, but You Love Us and Little Baby Nothing are right up there with it.\nA Night at the Opera – Queen\nEven if Greatest Hitses were allowed, this would still come in front of any of Queen’s compilations, for me. It was the album that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody (everybody’s favourite headbanging-in-cars tune), You’re My Best Friend and the questionable I’m in Love with my Car. But even these won’t stand out to everyone as the best – Death on Two Legs is wonderfully angry, and will probably remind you of every boss you ever hated. The Prophet’s Song is the ultimate murder-ballad, being eerie and apocalyptic. To counter these, we have the more jolly Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendezvous. It’s hard to imagine an album with a greater variety (especially as Bo-Rap itself has about six musical genres in one song). There’s not a bad track on the whole album, and to add to its brilliance, Brian May even plays ukulele on Good Company.\nMonster – R.E.M.\nNow then.\nTo my mind, this is the finest album ever made. And it will always remain so. No arguments, final word, no phoning a friend. Many will disagree – there were numerous music critics who thought that because it didn’t have the mainstream appeal of Out of Time or Automatic for the People, it wasn’t worth bothering about. Morons, I say. It’s certainly rockier than the previous two offerings, but hey, good bands should always be versatile. Crush with Eyeliner is my stand-out track, a gorgeous anti-love ballad, if that makes any sense. We have the better-known What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?, probably the only song ever based on a line shouted at a CBS anchorman by someone assaulting him with a bat. We have the lovely falsetto Tongue, Strange Currencies and number of other songs on themes of love, sex and identity, all as grungy and decadent as a diesel cheesecake. Buy it, now.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – David Bowie\nSo many Bowie albums to choose from, that I would be tempted to break the Greatest Hits rule. But if I had to pick one, it’d be this long-titled offering from the King of Glam. Even the cover of the LP is iconic, our Dave in his glam gear in Heddon Street, London. Ziggy Stardust, one of my favourite Bowie tracks, is the best on this album, but it’s in good company with Suffragette City and Starman – who can forgot the controversy this song caused when Bowie sang it on Top of the Pops, having the audacity to put his arm around Mick Ronson WHEN KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING. What sick filth, call the Daily Mail immediately. Before house prices drop or this blog gives you cancer.\nTwo Penny Opera – The Tiger Lillies\nA little-known band, but one with a worldwide following, and probably the band I’ve seen live the most. This is just one of the nigh-on thirty albums of theirs so far. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who might be easily offended, or might want to play the record in front of children, churchgoers or potential employers – especially if you’re after a Sunday School job. Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_05/content_163.html": "Soldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_12_18_five-years-and-counting/content_247.html": "Five Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04_15_deaths-in-sport/content_94.html": "Deaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_my-poetry/content_8.html": "My Poetry\nI consider poetry to be one of the finest art forms there is. It has something of an uncool image – though try going back in time and saying that to Byron’s face. But like any art form, poetry can be whatever you wish – angry, funny, sad, happy, weird, thought-provoking, dramatic, good, bad, avant-garde, lovey-dovey, dark, light, brainless, stupid, intelligent, uplifting or depressing. Most people will be able to think of examples of music for all of the above. No different with poetry.\nI began writing poetry back in my University days. I have to admit that I left a lot to be desired as a bard – a working knowledge of metre, for a start, though I was okay with rhyme. Yes, I know poetry needs neither – but that’s the sort of poetry that I generally prefer to read or write. I think it’s something to do with the puzzle element – trying to shape your thoughts so that they fit, as if it was some sort of lexical jigsaw puzzle. See this sestina of mine, for example.\nMy poetry was greatly improved a few years ago by the purchase of The Ode Less Travelled, by that lovely Stephen Fry. The book is written very much in his spoken style, with characteristic humour, but is also a very engaging tome upon metre, rhyme and form – and the understanding and practice thereof. It has exercises at every step – which I found very useful, some of which are now included in the body of my work.\nI’ve been much more fruitful poetically since reading that book. I now have seven sonnets, which makes me a 21th of the way to being the next Shakespeare. Hopefully, there’ll be a few more poems published here in the future.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_racism/content_40.html": "Washington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nEuro 2012 and Racism\nThe main element of bad press for Euro 2012 at the moment is racism. Not so much the whole John Terry/Rio Ferdinand story (personally, I’d have left both of them out of the squad; they’re past it now in my opinion); more the attitudes of the Polish and Ukrainian supporters. Racist attitudes, that is, of the sort that hasn’t been seen (to any great extent, at least) in English football since the 80s.\nAmong the numerous stories, we have players saying that they, or their whole teams, will leave the pitch if they receive racist abuse. We have Michel Platini stating that players will be booked if they do that (I believe that referees can book players for leaving the pitch without permission anyway). He’s had his critics for this, as one might expect – such a stance will always look soft on racism. But I’m not entirely sure that leaving the pitch (or indeed the entire tournament, as some have suggested) is the right thing to do. Let me explain.\nI’ll try to put this in some perspective first. Footballers will always, rightly or wrongly, receive abuse from fans. Indeed, I dished some out in my last blog post (though I would hope it’s taken as being tongue-in-cheek). And it needn’t be racist abuse. It might be to do with nationality, height, (perceived) sexuality, religion, weight, hair colour, criminal convictions, their invented illegitimacy, anything. Race is just one of these things. It just so happens that, for whatever reason, the general public in this country are more sensitive to racial abuse than to other forms – even though other forms of abuse can be taken to heart to the same extent that racism can be.\nBecause racism is seen to be worse, a footballer can be banned for numerous matches because of a racist taunt (as Luis Suárez was, for eight games, this season). But I’ve yet to see a player banned for any other sort of taunt to another player, and you’d have to be a fool to think that it doesn’t happen. Fans, too, can get bans or criminal convictions for racist abuse, but not for other forms. Players will make official complaints where racial taunting goes on, but again, not for other forms of abuse. On those occasions, they’d be expected to not let the abuse get to them, and to carry on the game as normal – whether the abuse comes from players or fans.\nIn my opinion, that’s the right attitude to take – don’t let it get to you. As children, we’re taught mantras such as “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We’re told to disregard bullies, as a reaction is exactly what they want. The racism problem of Euro 2012 is simply playground bullying writ large. Those handing out the abuse (who were probably the bullies in the playground, and probably haven’t grown up much since), whether players or fans, are looking for a reaction. They want to disrupt the rightful order of things for their own entertainment or gain. By giving a reaction, the racists are getting what they want. And if games are abandoned, we’d be punishing innocent people – those fans who have spent large amounts of flights, hotels, tickets, et cetera. The racists have their fun, the true fans lose their money and a chance to see their team, and the sports stars deny themselves their right to compete at the highest level in the continent. How can this be right in any way?\nThe point is this. Platini’s stance makes it sound like he wants to ignore racism entirely (and he might – I don’t exactly know him personally). But there’s a difference between ignoring something, and not allowing it to affect you. Teams certainly cannot ignore racism – but they can keep a cool head, maintain the moral high ground, and not allow the bastards to grind them down. The complaints can be made after the game, and we’d have to trust UEFA (I know that might be difficult) to mete out punishments to the FAs or clubs involved (as they did with Liverpool after the Heysel disaster). Theoretically, that should see the right people punished – not the true fans or the players.\nThe English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_06/content_150.html": "Religion\nThis post has been inspired by a question asked on the Sunderland Green Party forum recently, and I thought it might be worth a blog post, as religion is something that interests me, in terms of how it affects me and society. The question is thus:\nWhat role should religion play…?\n1. In the lives of yourself and others\n2. In politics / public debate and policy\nThe first question: A simple answer is that it probably shouldn’t have to have any role, although even in this day and age, it doubtlessly will, even if by minor degrees. Days of the week, for instance, being named for deities. The England flags ubiquitous during international football tournaments have a Christian cross upon them. Streets, schools and other places are often named for saints or other religious figures. Of course, these are just roses by other names, and probably don’t have any influence on ourselves or society to any great extent.\nThen, of course, there are those aspects of religion that do have a part in our lives, and affect the things we do – even if we’re not religious. We take Good Friday and Easter Monday off work, for instance. In the past we’ve been restricted by Sunday trading laws. And I can confidently predict that later in the year, myself (a Pagan) and my friends Nigel (an atheist) and Charlotte (a Jew) will be sitting around a table in a pub swapping Christmas presents. We also have some very major religious influences. Extremism, terrorism, war – in this way, religion has affected everybody from Holocaust victims to those people prevented from taking liquids onto aeroplanes. In vastly different ways, of course, but religion has been there; if not as a direct cause, then as an excuse. These are roles that religion plays in our lives regardless of whether or not one has a religion. Where a person does subscribe to a faith, however, its influence will be even more profound – though not necessarily on the same level. It really depends upon how a person sees their religion.\nSome will see their religion as a philosophy, or set of philosophies, to explain life, the universe and everything. In this respect, it probably differs only from atheism in the presence of some supreme being or entity. This may be enough to play a serious role in a person’s life. Reverence of nature is part of Druid belief, and subscription to that faith may well encourage somebody to be more kind to nature. But there is also a legislative aspect to many religions. Christianity has many laws, for want of a better word. The best known of these are the Ten Commandments, though the bible, in particular the Old Testament, is full of many others. Many will see it important to keep to such tenets, as a way of keeping faith or attaining some higher station (entering Heaven, for instance). This can be a positive thing if it encourages such things as friendliness and respect, but not so good if it represses natural tendencies, such as alternate sexualities.\nReligious law, however, raises a good question concerning personal freedom. Yes, a person has freedom of religion – but should a person be free to believe in something that prevents them from being themselves (and therefore even more free)? The argument over niqabs is a classic example – is it a woman’s right to subscribe to a religion that compels her to wear one, or is it a woman’s right to bear her face in public regardless?\nHowever, the second question is a little different. I’d agree that people have a right to religion (you can’t stop people believing what they want anyway, metaphysical or otherwise), though I don’t think it has a place in politics. Religion is, after all, a belief, not a proven fact, and it would be highly irresponsible of any government to allow blind faith to affect its decisions. Any metaphysical theory has only a minute chance of ever being correct, and faith itself is very arbitrary. Therefore, laws enacted in the name of faith are arbitrary. In Tudor England, for example, Catholics were executed as heretics when Protestants were in power; when the Catholics ruled, Protestants were executed. Clearly, government cannot be fair if it is based upon the unproven beliefs of whomever might be in power. Such beliefs do not even have to be religious, of course – McCarthyism brought the same sort of issues as the Salem Witch Trials.\nGovernment must work upon what is known. We know that condoms prevent death and disease. We do not know if there is a deity out there who will banish us unto eternal torment for using them. In reality, it’s just as possible (and as improbable) that there is a deity out there ready to grant us eternal paradise for the same thing. If there were proof, of course, that Hell awaited us for such an act, there’d be reason for our government to protect our eternal souls. But unless we have that, we cannot make laws on blind assumptions – religious or not.\nOf course, this isn’t to say that a state’s laws should not make any reference to religion at all. It should still be realised that people have a right to religion, and a right to practise it. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people can do so equally. I’ve long thought it a shame that the Bank Holiday schedule in England is mostly based around Christian festivals (even if they’re only there to suppress Pagan ones). A Muslim might be happy to be given Easter off, if for no other reason than a break from work, but would that same person be happy to be working through Ramadan? (if you’re a Muslim, I’d be interested in your thoughts on that – not being one, I can’t answer it. You get the idea, anyway).\nHaving said this, it often irritates me that religion is often given an untouchable status, whereas other forms of philosophy are not. For example, if an employee refused to work a Sunday to attend church, many employers would submit to that, for fear of being labelled politically incorrect (at best). But I doubt the same would apply to somebody who wished to attend a political event, no matter how fervent their belief. If we recognise religious freedom in the law, we should also recognise other philosophical freedoms.\nSlutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_sport/content_16.html": "Washington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay.

Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade.

These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches. Next year, perhaps…\nFaster, Higher, Stranger\nThe Olympics continues to generate mixed feelings for me. Not so much the impending London Olympiad, more the whole concept of it. Or at least, what it has become.\nFact is, I love the idea of it. That the finest athletes from a round the globe can descend upon one city and give a showcase of their sport, and sport in general. Sport is an important thing; it is to the physical what science is to the mental, and what art is to the emotional. It can be as inspirational as science or art, and can promote confidence and team work just as much as science and art. It also has the obvious health benefits. To advertise sport on a global level, as the Olympics no doubt does, is therefore a good thing.\nThis idea of it being a celebration of elite sport, and perhaps sportsmanship, is one that has always been handed to us, by the media and society. And that’s how I viewed it when I first encountered the Olympics. That was the Seoul Olympiad of 1998, when I was ten. My single memory of that is Ben Johnson’s disqualification for the use of steroids. Completely against the idea of sportsmanship, obviously, but the disqualification seemed to me to show that sportsmanship was the central value of the Olympics. Transgressors would be found and punished, and sporting integrity would reign supreme once more.\nThe 1992 and 1996 Olympics, as far as my teenage self was concerned, were also good, enjoyable sporting events that showcased sport, and presented it in the right light. Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell shone in 1992, and it proved to me for the first time how good the Olympics was at highlighting fringe sports. I have memories of watching Simon Terry win bronze for Britain in the Archery (he’s back this year, too). I’m sure around this period, the Winter Olympics had me hooked on Curling as well.\nBut as we went through the games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing, things seemed to change. More and more, athletes were being caught by the doping people. These would often be followed by denials, rightly or wrongly. In any case, the amount of these cases hardly helped the Olympics to retain its reputation for sportsmanship.\nAnd as we’ve become accustomed in this day and age, the sponsorship seems to be increasingly ludicrous. Official thises-and-thats of each Olympiad take up advertising space in any medium that’ll have it. I’ll not be surprised to see allegations of ambush marketing at London 2012, as we saw in the South Africa World Cup in 2010. And we’ve already heard stories saying that spectators will be searched for their own food and drink before being allowed entry to events.\nWhich brings me to London 2012. From ludicrous ticket pricing systems (computer took ten minutes to tell me a ticket was available for football, THEN told me I’d have to pay £6 for postage. I declined.) to residents of London tower block putting in complaints about artillery being placed on top of their buildings, much of the preparation for this Olympiad has seemed little more than a ridiculous farce. And I’m not confident that this image will be shaken off during or after the games.\nThis said, I’ll no doubt still end up watching a fair bit of it (the Archery schedules have already been bookmarked). The basic principles of the Olympics, or what I considered them to be, will not entirely have dissipated. We will still have top class athletes who want fair competition, so it seems unfair to deny them the chance to show us their capabilities just because the powers that be might have porridge for brains. Unfortunately, when you have fools at the top, their foolishness blinds them from their foolishness, so it might be a while before things change. Oh well.\nEuro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nDeaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nPoppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_writing/content_70.html": "A Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nOut of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_08_31_edinburgh-fringe-2009/content_197.html": "Edinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_theatre/content_187.html": "Apples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nRuth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nApples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nFive Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.\nSoldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!\nStand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nArtistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_stuff-i-do-2/content_128.html": "Apples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nNorth East Skinny Dip 2013\nSeeing as last year’s event was so much fun, I’ve once again signed up to do the fabulous North East Skinny Dip!\nThis year, the event takes place on Sunday September 21st at sunrise, at the beautiful Druridge Bay in Northumberland.\nThis time around I can attest to how fantastic an experience it is. The water wasn’t particularly cold, and believe me, you don’t have to worry about anyone judging your imperfect body – if one thing is obvious at these events, it’s that nobody is perfect. It’s all about having some free-spirited fun, and raising some cash for charity.\nWanna join us? If so, here’s the registration page. It only costs a £10 to register.\nIf you don’t quite think you have the bottle, but still want to support the excellent mental health charity Mind, then here’s the oversized attention-seeking link:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nGo on, you only live once.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nRetrospection\nNo plays performed in front of major international stars this year, but you can’t have everything. Still, a lot of good stuff to look back upon.\nJanuary: Back to panto action, with the Washington Theatre Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.\nFebruary: Trip to Liverpool for the Green Party conference and some tourism.\nMarch: About forty different birthday booze-ups for Nigel’s 40th. Seemed like that anyway.\nApril: Performed in a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker. Took a trip into Darkest Yorkshire, too – somehow returning with a lot of beer.\nMay: Trip to London for a birthday. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that cake. I think I winced when the knife went in. Any man would. That should give you an idea of what shape it was.\nJune: Attempted a weekend break in Grizedale, but rain contrived to have half the campsite flooded. Despite this, a memorable trip if only for that wonderful game pie at the Eagle’s Head – the highlight of the 13-hour holiday. Performed this poem at the launch event for the Middlesbrough Literary Festival.\nJuly: A second camping trip, this time around the Northumbrian Coast, proved more successful. Great weather all over the place, and the fish and chips from Beadnell Bay are highly recommended.\nAugust: Took part in an anti-NF demo in Sunderland. The star of the NF show was the guy in the Chelsea shirt with “Essien” on the back. Michael Essien, a black foreigner, an immigrant with a job. Love the logic there.\nSeptember: Highlight of the year: The North-East Skinny Dip. Yes, jumping in the North Sea at 7 in the morning is the best thing that happened to me this year. Believe it or else. Flag bearer at Sunderland Pride, too. And interviewed by the same Sky reporter and both events.\nOctober: Unexpectedly found myself performing in The Edge of Darkness at The Royalty after an actor had to drop out due to illness on the final night. Scary experience, and an ironic one – I’m the smartarse who always knows his lines first, and I had to do the entire performance with a script.\nNovember: Started archery lessons with Whitburn Archers.\nDecember: Directing The Day after the Fair. Coming to a theatre near you soon. If you’re near The Royalty.\nRoll on 2013.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now. Anyway, in honour of the recent North-East Skinny Dip, an Anacreontic ode (good for upbeat celebration of something so free-spirited) on the fun we had…\nEau Naturel\nTwenty-second of September!\nWhat a morning to remember!\nScores of people in the nip,\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\nThere we stood at Druridge Bay,\nAt the very break of day.\nWaiting on the icy sand,\nDipping hour close at hand.\nFinally we got the call:\n“Okay, dippers – bear it all!”\nOff it came, right then and there,\nEverybody’s underwear.\nLiberated from our clothes,\nOff we ran, with frozen toes\nStraight into the foaming brine,\nAs the sun began to shine.\nHordes of people filled the sea,\nIn the name of charity.\nMen and women, young and old,\nBody sizes manifold.\nDodging waves, we swam about,\nFree and easy, wearing nowt.\nAll around were laughs and hoots,\nFrom the folk in birthday suits.\nProud to show their naked forms,\nChallenging the social norms.\nNot a body part seemed rude,\nWith so many in the nude.\nOnce we all had swum enough,\nOut we stumbled, in the buff.\nClothed and warm, we got some scran\nFrom the handy burger van.\nThis much needed body heat\nPut some feeling in my feet.\nBack home, I was pleased to find\nLoads of money raised for Mind;\nTV, radio and papers\nCovering our naked capers.\nBest of all, I think I’ve grown,\nChallenging my comfort zone –\nFor I’d had the guts to strip\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\n© John Appleton 2012\nNude Glorious Nude\n(Oliver-based title pun, ‘cos the production currently at Newcastle Theatre Royal is very worth seeing. But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.\nRid of You\nSo, this is the film what I made last year. Enjoy.\nUpdate: The video’s been removed; I’ll keep an eye out to see if it appears again.\nNorth-East Skinny Dip\nYes. You read that right. Hopefully it’ll be a world record for the biggest number of naked idiots jumping into the sea at once. That’s gotta be worth a few sponsorship pounds.\nThe North-East Skinny Dip is taking place on Saturday 22nd September at very silly o’clock in the morning, in the North Sea (see idiots comment earlier). We’re doing it for a very worthy charity (MIND, a national mental health charity), as well as for an cracking answer to the question, “So, done anything interesting lately?”. I think it’s difficult to beat.\nBut here’s the important bit where I try to get you to part with your hard-earned: There’s a single sponsorship page (under one person’s name, but it all goes to the same charity), so that we don’t all have to mess about with creating hundreds of JustGiving pages (and so that if you know more than one of us but want to sponsor us all, that’s easier). Anyway, to make the sponsorship link nice and easy to spot, here it is in stupidly big format:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nThanks in advance if you do choose to donate some cash to this very worthy cause. Alternatively, if you’d actually like to take part, the registration site is here (and see the link to the Facebook event page above – invite your friends – or your enemies). Wish us luck!\nFaster, Higher, Stranger\nThe Olympics continues to generate mixed feelings for me. Not so much the impending London Olympiad, more the whole concept of it. Or at least, what it has become.\nFact is, I love the idea of it. That the finest athletes from a round the globe can descend upon one city and give a showcase of their sport, and sport in general. Sport is an important thing; it is to the physical what science is to the mental, and what art is to the emotional. It can be as inspirational as science or art, and can promote confidence and team work just as much as science and art. It also has the obvious health benefits. To advertise sport on a global level, as the Olympics no doubt does, is therefore a good thing.\nThis idea of it being a celebration of elite sport, and perhaps sportsmanship, is one that has always been handed to us, by the media and society. And that’s how I viewed it when I first encountered the Olympics. That was the Seoul Olympiad of 1998, when I was ten. My single memory of that is Ben Johnson’s disqualification for the use of steroids. Completely against the idea of sportsmanship, obviously, but the disqualification seemed to me to show that sportsmanship was the central value of the Olympics. Transgressors would be found and punished, and sporting integrity would reign supreme once more.\nThe 1992 and 1996 Olympics, as far as my teenage self was concerned, were also good, enjoyable sporting events that showcased sport, and presented it in the right light. Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell shone in 1992, and it proved to me for the first time how good the Olympics was at highlighting fringe sports. I have memories of watching Simon Terry win bronze for Britain in the Archery (he’s back this year, too). I’m sure around this period, the Winter Olympics had me hooked on Curling as well.\nBut as we went through the games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing, things seemed to change. More and more, athletes were being caught by the doping people. These would often be followed by denials, rightly or wrongly. In any case, the amount of these cases hardly helped the Olympics to retain its reputation for sportsmanship.\nAnd as we’ve become accustomed in this day and age, the sponsorship seems to be increasingly ludicrous. Official thises-and-thats of each Olympiad take up advertising space in any medium that’ll have it. I’ll not be surprised to see allegations of ambush marketing at London 2012, as we saw in the South Africa World Cup in 2010. And we’ve already heard stories saying that spectators will be searched for their own food and drink before being allowed entry to events.\nWhich brings me to London 2012. From ludicrous ticket pricing systems (computer took ten minutes to tell me a ticket was available for football, THEN told me I’d have to pay £6 for postage. I declined.) to residents of London tower block putting in complaints about artillery being placed on top of their buildings, much of the preparation for this Olympiad has seemed little more than a ridiculous farce. And I’m not confident that this image will be shaken off during or after the games.\nThis said, I’ll no doubt still end up watching a fair bit of it (the Archery schedules have already been bookmarked). The basic principles of the Olympics, or what I considered them to be, will not entirely have dissipated. We will still have top class athletes who want fair competition, so it seems unfair to deny them the chance to show us their capabilities just because the powers that be might have porridge for brains. Unfortunately, when you have fools at the top, their foolishness blinds them from their foolishness, so it might be a while before things change. Oh well.",

Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_12/content_132.html": "A Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nRetrospection\nIt’s been a hell of a year, if I’m honest. There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nFive Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_argentina/content_80.html": "Las Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_theatre/content_161.html": "Ruth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nApples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nFive Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.\nSoldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!\nStand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nArtistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_film/content_76.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nRid of You\nSo, this is the film what I made last year. Enjoy.\nUpdate: The video’s been removed; I’ll keep an eye out to see if it appears again.\nSoldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2016_06/content_134.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_12_10_university-fees/content_214.html": "University Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_08/content_50.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nNorth East Skinny Dip 2013\nSeeing as last year’s event was so much fun, I’ve once again signed up to do the fabulous North East Skinny Dip!\nThis year, the event takes place on Sunday September 21st at sunrise, at the beautiful Druridge Bay in Northumberland.\nThis time around I can attest to how fantastic an experience it is. The water wasn’t particularly cold, and believe me, you don’t have to worry about anyone judging your imperfect body – if one thing is obvious at these events, it’s that nobody is perfect. It’s all about having some free-spirited fun, and raising some cash for charity.\nWanna join us? If so, here’s the registration page.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_spiders/content_125.html": "Out of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_05/content_137.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_01/content_144.html": "To Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might. And to force a rule in this situation would be Linguistic Nazism, and I’ll have to truck with that.",

But not all of you will want to avoid me, especially if I owe you money or beer. Or, if you simply find me interesting, for which I can’t blame you. As such, you’ll find below a potted autobiography, that’ll hopefully give an insight into where I’ve been, what I’ve done, and why I shouldn’t always be taken seriously. Enjoy.\nThe Seventies\n1978: Born in Middlesbrough, England, to wild scenes of celebration across the country.\n1979: Discover that people are prepared to give me fruit pastilles to shut up. Waste no time in exploiting it.\nThe Eighties\n1980: Come second in Cutest Baby Competition at Butlin’s. Prize is giant inflatable orange mouse, which spends the next year or so frightening the shit out of me.\n1981: Family moves to South Africa to seek fortune, which didn’t turn out to be there. Orange mouse accompanies us.\n1982: Apparently, I liked Dolly Parton. This explains a few things.\n1983: Earliest memory of a fondness for humorous wordplay, after noticing that a “TO LET” sign appeared to have a letter missing. To be fair, in 80’s Johannesburg, it probably did.\n1984: Fall face-first onto kitchen floor. Teeth scattered far and wide. One later turns up in Boise, Idaho.\n1985: Family moves to Botswana after dad gets job in a diamond mine. Destined forever to be asked “Did you steal any diamonds?” by people who seriously think it’s that simple.\n1985: Become convinced that 1985 happened twice. No-one believes me.\n1986: Write first ever computer programme (mine, not humanity’s), which prints “TREVOR IS DAFT” down the screen ad infinitum. Highly amused. Uncle Trevor not quite so amused.\n1987: First ever stage role, as member of chorus singing Any Dream Will Do in Joseph. Costume includes beach towel with picture of yacht on, which was presumably de rigeur in ancient Canaan.\n1988: Open birthday present to discover it’s a box of tools to fix bike. Feel all manly. Open another present to discover it’s a Rick Astley tape. Brought back down to Earth.\n1989: School production of Zulu musical Ipi Tombi sees me playing the role of “Macho Man”. Twelve children and one teacher hospitalised with irony poisoning.\nThe Nineties\n1990: Play the back end of an elephant in school play. Twelve children and one teacher make full recovery. Move back to England and within three weeks, Margaret Thatcher resigns. Country owes me big time.\n1991: Go on holiday to Bognor Regis, staying at Butlin’s. Thankfully, not a bloody orange inflatable mouse in sight.\n1992: Move to Jarrow; once a centre of English Christianity, once a bastion of working class prosperity. Find much has changed.\n1993: Discover the Back to the Future trilogy. Years after everyone else, obviously, but it was probably just my density…\n1994: Leave school with 9 GCSEs. Have to decide between studying Performing Arts and IT at college. Foolishly take the sensible option.\n1995: Get drunk for the first time ever, aged 16 and 11 months. On two pints of lager. How times change.\n1996: Enrol at Sunderland University as computing student, but soon become student in drinking cheap beer, playing pool and skipping Friday afternoon lectures to drink cheap beer. And play pool.\n1997: Join the National Hat Society, a student drinking society of dubious advisability. Locking yourself out of your flat after a night on the drink is one thing. In Sunderland, another. On charity cross-dressing night, yet another.\n1998: Begin 1-year work placement at British Steel in Hartlepool, which is strangely bereft of monkeys. Or so I thought, until I met the apprentices.\n1999: Trip to Bridlington to visit some university friends during the summer. Walk along the beach unearths one of my teeth from 1984.\nThe Noughties\n2000: Graduate from University of Sunderland with honours degree in being able to fix anyone’s computer merely by being told, “Well, it’s coming up with this error”. Or so you’d think.\n2001: A weekend trip to Dublin leads to the legendary chef/roundabout story. Read it at your peril.\n2002: First trip to Whitby Goth Weekend. As you probably won’t want the mental image of me in PVC trousers, I promise not to mention them.\n2003: Become Musical Statues champion of Gateshead Storm ARLFC, a title I believe I still hold. Safe bet, I think.\n2004: Go on a stag weekend to Copenhagen, where we immediately immerse ourselves in Danish culture by going to a Scottish theme bar and eating at MacDonald’s. To date, Copenhagen is the only European capital in which I’ve played rugby at 2am, in the middle of a road, with a pineapple as a ball.\n2005: Move out of parents’ home. Dad immediately destroys bed to prevent me returning.\n2006: Witness acclaimed TV memory-feat bloke Derren Brown leave a London bar and forget his coat, on the same night that I win a meat platter in a raffle 300 miles away. Not sure such a thing will ever happen again in all of time.\n2007: Join Washington Theatre Group and end the year in the role of pantomime dame. Thankfully, no repeat of 1997.\n2008: Join Royalty Theatre and get cast as 8-stone Irish Jockey. Irony contamination leaves Sunderland uninhabitable, but nobody notices.\n2009: Mental note – when performing in a pantomime, remember to wear trousers with a functional zip.\nThe Tens\n2010: Chilean miners, trapped underground for 69 days, discover another tooth from 1984.\n2011: Fail to shut up about Ian McKellen coming to see me (and the rest of the cast, obviously) in Macbeth. Demonstrably still failing.\n2012: Attempt holiday in the Lake District, but flee before it becomes a holiday in the Atlantic, such was the weather.\nHave your say!",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_wtg/content_194.html": "Five Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_superheroes/content_152.html": "Flipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_08_13_desert-island-horror-movies/content_67.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nDesert Island Horror Movies | ChristianBookBarn.com said,\nAugust 13, 2013 at 12:27 pm\n[…] Recommended Article FROM https://oddbodd13.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/desert-island-horror-movies/ […]",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_religion/content_54.html": "Religion\nThis post has been inspired by a question asked on the Sunderland Green Party forum recently, and I thought it might be worth a blog post, as religion is something that interests me, in terms of how it affects me and society. The question is thus:\nWhat role should religion play…?\n1. In the lives of yourself and others\n2. In politics / public debate and policy\nThe first question: A simple answer is that it probably shouldn’t have to have any role, although even in this day and age, it doubtlessly will, even if by minor degrees. Days of the week, for instance, being named for deities. The England flags ubiquitous during international football tournaments have a Christian cross upon them. Streets, schools and other places are often named for saints or other religious figures. Of course, these are just roses by other names, and probably don’t have any influence on ourselves or society to any great extent.\nThen, of course, there are those aspects of religion that do have a part in our lives, and affect the things we do – even if we’re not religious. We take Good Friday and Easter Monday off work, for instance. In the past we’ve been restricted by Sunday trading laws. And I can confidently predict that later in the year, myself (a Pagan) and my friends Nigel (an atheist) and Charlotte (a Jew) will be sitting around a table in a pub swapping Christmas presents. We also have some very major religious influences. Extremism, terrorism, war – in this way, religion has affected everybody from Holocaust victims to those people prevented from taking liquids onto aeroplanes. In vastly different ways, of course, but religion has been there; if not as a direct cause, then as an excuse. These are roles that religion plays in our lives regardless of whether or not one has a religion. Where a person does subscribe to a faith, however, its influence will be even more profound – though not necessarily on the same level. It really depends upon how a person sees their religion.\nSome will see their religion as a philosophy, or set of philosophies, to explain life, the universe and everything. In this respect, it probably differs only from atheism in the presence of some supreme being or entity. This may be enough to play a serious role in a person’s life. Reverence of nature is part of Druid belief, and subscription to that faith may well encourage somebody to be more kind to nature. But there is also a legislative aspect to many religions. Christianity has many laws, for want of a better word. The best known of these are the Ten Commandments, though the bible, in particular the Old Testament, is full of many others. Many will see it important to keep to such tenets, as a way of keeping faith or attaining some higher station (entering Heaven, for instance). This can be a positive thing if it encourages such things as friendliness and respect, but not so good if it represses natural tendencies, such as alternate sexualities.\nReligious law, however, raises a good question concerning personal freedom. Yes, a person has freedom of religion – but should a person be free to believe in something that prevents them from being themselves (and therefore even more free)? The argument over niqabs is a classic example – is it a woman’s right to subscribe to a religion that compels her to wear one, or is it a woman’s right to bear her face in public regardless?\nHowever, the second question is a little different. I’d agree that people have a right to religion (you can’t stop people believing what they want anyway, metaphysical or otherwise), though I don’t think it has a place in politics. Religion is, after all, a belief, not a proven fact, and it would be highly irresponsible of any government to allow blind faith to affect its decisions. Any metaphysical theory has only a minute chance of ever being correct, and faith itself is very arbitrary. Therefore, laws enacted in the name of faith are arbitrary. In Tudor England, for example, Catholics were executed as heretics when Protestants were in power; when the Catholics ruled, Protestants were executed. Clearly, government cannot be fair if it is based upon the unproven beliefs of whomever might be in power. Such beliefs do not even have to be religious, of course – McCarthyism brought the same sort of issues as the Salem Witch Trials.\nGovernment must work upon what is known. We know that condoms prevent death and disease. We do not know if there is a deity out there who will banish us unto eternal torment for using them. In reality, it’s just as possible (and as improbable) that there is a deity out there ready to grant us eternal paradise for the same thing. If there were proof, of course, that Hell awaited us for such an act, there’d be reason for our government to protect our eternal souls. But unless we have that, we cannot make laws on blind assumptions – religious or not.\nOf course, this isn’t to say that a state’s laws should not make any reference to religion at all. It should still be realised that people have a right to religion, and a right to practise it. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people can do so equally. I’ve long thought it a shame that the Bank Holiday schedule in England is mostly based around Christian festivals (even if they’re only there to suppress Pagan ones). A Muslim might be happy to be given Easter off, if for no other reason than a break from work, but would that same person be happy to be working through Ramadan? (if you’re a Muslim, I’d be interested in your thoughts on that – not being one, I can’t answer it. You get the idea, anyway).\nHaving said this, it often irritates me that religion is often given an untouchable status, whereas other forms of philosophy are not. For example, if an employee refused to work a Sunday to attend church, many employers would submit to that, for fear of being labelled politically incorrect (at best). But I doubt the same would apply to somebody who wished to attend a political event, no matter how fervent their belief. If we recognise religious freedom in the law, we should also recognise other philosophical freedoms.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_07/content_52.html": "Apples on Tour – The Northumbrian Coast\nThere are three principal reasons that I think the North of England rocks. These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches. Next year, perhaps…\nFaster, Higher, Stranger\nThe Olympics continues to generate mixed feelings for me. Not so much the impending London Olympiad, more the whole concept of it. Or at least, what it has become.\nFact is, I love the idea of it. That the finest athletes from a round the globe can descend upon one city and give a showcase of their sport, and sport in general. Sport is an important thing; it is to the physical what science is to the mental, and what art is to the emotional. It can be as inspirational as science or art, and can promote confidence and team work just as much as science and art. It also has the obvious health benefits. To advertise sport on a global level, as the Olympics no doubt does, is therefore a good thing.\nThis idea of it being a celebration of elite sport, and perhaps sportsmanship, is one that has always been handed to us, by the media and society. And that’s how I viewed it when I first encountered the Olympics. That was the Seoul Olympiad of 1998, when I was ten. My single memory of that is Ben Johnson’s disqualification for the use of steroids. Completely against the idea of sportsmanship, obviously, but the disqualification seemed to me to show that sportsmanship was the central value of the Olympics. Transgressors would be found and punished, and sporting integrity would reign supreme once more.\nThe 1992 and 1996 Olympics, as far as my teenage self was concerned, were also good, enjoyable sporting events that showcased sport, and presented it in the right light. Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell shone in 1992, and it proved to me for the first time how good the Olympics was at highlighting fringe sports. I have memories of watching Simon Terry win bronze for Britain in the Archery (he’s back this year, too). I’m sure around this period, the Winter Olympics had me hooked on Curling as well.\nBut as we went through the games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing, things seemed to change. More and more, athletes were being caught by the doping people. These would often be followed by denials, rightly or wrongly. In any case, the amount of these cases hardly helped the Olympics to retain its reputation for sportsmanship.\nAnd as we’ve become accustomed in this day and age, the sponsorship seems to be increasingly ludicrous. Official thises-and-thats of each Olympiad take up advertising space in any medium that’ll have it. I’ll not be surprised to see allegations of ambush marketing at London 2012, as we saw in the South Africa World Cup in 2010. And we’ve already heard stories saying that spectators will be searched for their own food and drink before being allowed entry to events.\nWhich brings me to London 2012. From ludicrous ticket pricing systems (computer took ten minutes to tell me a ticket was available for football, THEN told me I’d have to pay £6 for postage. I declined.) to residents of London tower block putting in complaints about artillery being placed on top of their buildings, much of the preparation for this Olympiad has seemed little more than a ridiculous farce. And I’m not confident that this image will be shaken off during or after the games.\nThis said, I’ll no doubt still end up watching a fair bit of it (the Archery schedules have already been bookmarked). The basic principles of the Olympics, or what I considered them to be, will not entirely have dissipated. We will still have top class athletes who want fair competition, so it seems unfair to deny them the chance to show us their capabilities just because the powers that be might have porridge for brains. Unfortunately, when you have fools at the top, their foolishness blinds them from their foolishness, so it might be a while before things change. Oh well.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_12_09_nelson-mandela/content_233.html": "Nelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.\nTony Appleton said,\nDecember 9, 2013 at 6:41 am\nVery well put, Forgive but don’t forget.\nbtrowes63 said,\nJanuary 8, 2014 at 8:18 pm\nFinally found you, Apples.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_02_27_apples-on-tour-liverpool/content_227.html": "Apples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop. No time to visit Anfield, unfortunately, but I did at least get to watch Liverpool’s penalty shoot-out win in the League Cup Final. Come on you Reds.\nSo, I have not been disappointed by this eagerly-awaited trip. There’s probably a lot more to discover about Liverpool, as there always will be with any place. So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.\nNeen said,\nFebruary 28, 2012 at 11:19 pm\n🙂\nRetrospection « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 28, 2012 at 4:08 pm\n[…] Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.

Preferring to keep an open mind on this grand claim, I took to reading it. At this point it might be prudent to describe my political leanings at the time I began reading. Swinging both ways, really – of the opinion that neither Capitalism nor Socialism held all of the answers.\nFor those unfamiliar with the book, it depicts the lives of a group of workers for a painting and decorating firm in the South of England, in the very early 20th century. We see the conditions under which the men have to work, often oppressed by their profit-minded masters – forced to work as shoddily and cheaply as possible to maximise profits. We see the men’s home lives, and how their poverty affects their wives, parents and children – very little to eat, or indeed to wear. We see the opposite side, the corrupt, yet affluent, lives of the masters – affected Christianity and corrupt control of the means of production and of council business.\nThe book itself is an engaging enough novel, with its occasional comedy and tragedy. But its intent is certainly to be more than entertaining. Throughout the book we are treated to the vision of Owen, one of the labourers, trying to convert his fellow workers to Socialist ideals. The workers themselves, by and large, dismiss these ideas, despite the obvious benefits they’d reap from such a system. Such is the indoctrination of these people that they believe that the status quo should remain because it’s simply the way things are. This is something I see all the time – workers will often happily accept the status quo because they don’t think that they have the authority, or the right, to question it. And it happens in other spheres of society, too. How long have people repressed homosexuality for fear that it wasn’t normal – and how many women have stayed at home to look after the kids and do the housework, because “that’s what’s supposed to happen”?\nThe book therefore, has a clear agenda – to promote Socialism. It would be very harsh to call it propaganda, but it is clearly didactic. And to very good effect. Socialism is not a term I’ve always understood. Dictionary definitions are usually too vague, the nature of dictionaries limiting defintions to a few lines. Encyclopaedic sources, even the internet kind without the limit of paper space, are often written academically, to be understood by those with a good knowledge of political or socio-economic jargon. Allegories, such as Animal Farm, can seem a bit too distant from the world of the reader, and so do not really afford any pathos. The explanations given in the book are perfectly understandable, and the setting of the novel around a group of working men, facing situations that even myself, as a white-collar worker, can relate to.\nMore importantly, the arguments for Socialism are convincing.\nIf they do want for anything, it is that the book portrays Socialism in the greatest light possible. It presents a dream of an almost Utopian world, with peace, harmony and utter contentment everywhere. Perhaps I’m cynical, but whatever benefits might arise from Socialism, I doubt that it would lead to a perfect world. A better world, quite possibly, but not perfect. Another problem, though not at all insurmountable, is the difference between the book’s world and the world of today. The two are very different, so perhaps the vision of Socialism presented to us by Tressell might not be fully workable in this day and age, but that’s no reason to simply give it up as a bad job.\nSo where am I politically now? More to the left, certainly. More questioning of the status quo. And undoubtedly more aware of the effects of Capitalism on society – I’m becoming more aware of the Co-operative and Fairtrade movements, and the benefits that such things provide. When you’ve grown up all of your life in a Capitalist society, as I have, it’s often difficult to miss them. I’m glad I can see things from another angle now.\nJennieB said,\nNovember 9, 2009 at 2:28 pm\nI’m so, so glad that you enjoyed this book; it was certainly a political eye-opener for me (and I am of an anarchic bent when it comes to politics).\nI think the one thing in the book that doesn’t really get highlighted – and I have these discussion with people who call themselves socialists today – is what happens after we’ve gained this socialist utopia? Tressell would be spinning in his grave to see what the original Trade Union strong Labour party has become (it’s argued that the party was set up with this book as an influencial, central tome).\nAs for possibilities for society: there’s lots of recent thinking (again mostly academic) on social ‘movements’, rather than a fixed formula for societal contextualisation (there’s some good stuff on the Autonomous Geographies website about some of the projects: http://www.autonomousgeographies.org).\nAnd I agree with you about not ‘giving it up as a bad job’. In my opinion, there’s no reason to give up on wanting to create a more equitable society that has principles not based on wealth, but on creating happiness and community cohesion; a society that has human, animal, and nature rights at its heart.\noddbodd13 said,\nNovember 23, 2009 at 10:28 pm\nYou’re quite right to question what happens afterwards. So many revolutions are just that – they go full circle, with the victors becoming as bad as the original oppressors. It’s not just something we see in Animal Farm. Look at Cromwell – Within four years of defeating the royalists, he was sole ruler of England, dissolving Parliament at will, as Charles I had done so often.\nOf course, since it’s England, that wasn’t revolution. Civil War, obviously.

But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.\nhomeclothesfree said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 1:31 pm\nReblogged this on home clothes free.\noddbodd13 said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 11:25 pm\nMany thanks for that.\nhomeclothesfree said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 11:30 pm\nHey it was a good post ending reading thank you for sharing we need more honest expressions of nudist experiences\nsassycoupleok said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 4:34 pm\nBroadening one’s horizons thru simple nudity or group nudity can be quite energizing!\nRetrospection « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 28, 2012 at 4:08 pm\n[…] foreigner, an immigrant with a job.

The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nSoldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!",

And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nHave your say!",

There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday.

Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_06_19_alan-turings-centenary/content_169.html": "Alan Turing’s Centenary\nHe might have been 100 this coming weekend. You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2014_06_19_washington-redskins-back-to-the-present/content_226.html": "Washington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nHave your say!",

The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nMonica Weller FRPS (@WellerMonica) said,\nMarch 7, 2015 at 11:10 pm\nI saw Amanda’s play when it was performed in 2013 at St James’s Theatre in London. As the ghost writer of RUTH ELLIS MY SISTER’S SECRET LIFE I was asked to write a piece for the programme that was on sale at the theatre. You are right in that the story needs to be told. You are not correct though in saying “There’s no doubt she committed the crime”.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_10_04_stand-up-comedy/content_200.html": "Stand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_07/content_188.html": "Flipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_05_03_the-2015-general-election/content_81.html": "The 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nHave your say!",

Please come along if you can.\nApples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04_22_apples-on-tour-todmorden-et-al/content_135.html": "Apples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nRetrospection « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 28, 2012 at 4:08 pm\n[…] a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker.

And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_03_16_night-of-the-living-chefs/content_96.html": "Night of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_07_22_faster-higher-stranger/content_206.html": "Faster, Higher, Stranger\nThe Olympics continues to generate mixed feelings for me. Not so much the impending London Olympiad, more the whole concept of it. Or at least, what it has become.\nFact is, I love the idea of it. That the finest athletes from a round the globe can descend upon one city and give a showcase of their sport, and sport in general. Sport is an important thing; it is to the physical what science is to the mental, and what art is to the emotional. It can be as inspirational as science or art, and can promote confidence and team work just as much as science and art. It also has the obvious health benefits. To advertise sport on a global level, as the Olympics no doubt does, is therefore a good thing.\nThis idea of it being a celebration of elite sport, and perhaps sportsmanship, is one that has always been handed to us, by the media and society. And that’s how I viewed it when I first encountered the Olympics. That was the Seoul Olympiad of 1998, when I was ten. My single memory of that is Ben Johnson’s disqualification for the use of steroids. Completely against the idea of sportsmanship, obviously, but the disqualification seemed to me to show that sportsmanship was the central value of the Olympics. Transgressors would be found and punished, and sporting integrity would reign supreme once more.\nThe 1992 and 1996 Olympics, as far as my teenage self was concerned, were also good, enjoyable sporting events that showcased sport, and presented it in the right light. Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell shone in 1992, and it proved to me for the first time how good the Olympics was at highlighting fringe sports. I have memories of watching Simon Terry win bronze for Britain in the Archery (he’s back this year, too). I’m sure around this period, the Winter Olympics had me hooked on Curling as well.\nBut as we went through the games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing, things seemed to change. More and more, athletes were being caught by the doping people. These would often be followed by denials, rightly or wrongly. In any case, the amount of these cases hardly helped the Olympics to retain its reputation for sportsmanship.\nAnd as we’ve become accustomed in this day and age, the sponsorship seems to be increasingly ludicrous. Official thises-and-thats of each Olympiad take up advertising space in any medium that’ll have it. I’ll not be surprised to see allegations of ambush marketing at London 2012, as we saw in the South Africa World Cup in 2010. And we’ve already heard stories saying that spectators will be searched for their own food and drink before being allowed entry to events.\nWhich brings me to London 2012. From ludicrous ticket pricing systems (computer took ten minutes to tell me a ticket was available for football, THEN told me I’d have to pay £6 for postage. I declined.) to residents of London tower block putting in complaints about artillery being placed on top of their buildings, much of the preparation for this Olympiad has seemed little more than a ridiculous farce. And I’m not confident that this image will be shaken off during or after the games.\nThis said, I’ll no doubt still end up watching a fair bit of it (the Archery schedules have already been bookmarked). The basic principles of the Olympics, or what I considered them to be, will not entirely have dissipated. We will still have top class athletes who want fair competition, so it seems unfair to deny them the chance to show us their capabilities just because the powers that be might have porridge for brains. Unfortunately, when you have fools at the top, their foolishness blinds them from their foolishness, so it might be a while before things change. Oh well.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_12_29_a-novel-idea/content_115.html": "A Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_05_03_apples-on-tour-cambridge-and-east-anglia/content_127.html": "Apples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nHave your say!",

The water wasn’t particularly cold, and believe me, you don’t have to worry about anyone judging your imperfect body – if one thing is obvious at these events, it’s that nobody is perfect. It’s all about having some free-spirited fun, and raising some cash for charity.\nWanna join us? If so, here’s the registration page.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_11_08_poppies-and-the-england-team/content_133.html": "Poppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_04_24_paulo-di-canio-and-feminism/content_95.html": "Paulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_05_05_the-2010-general-election/content_7.html": "The 2010 General Election\nIt feels like there’s something important about tomorrow’s General Election. Perhaps it’s simply because over the past year or so, I’ve been more acutely aware of politics in Britain, and indeed the world. Not just from a point of view of Westminster/Capitol Hill, but also from a point of view of the grass roots of society, and how they’re treated by the higher classes. Perhaps it’s because there have been some major events that transcended the purely political and the ordinary – The economic crisis is seen on the streets, it’s talked of in Whitehall as a major issue. Barrack Obama’s healthcare reforms have divided America, from the unemployed to the whatever the US might consider their aristocracy. Perhaps, it’s just because we look like we’re in for a change of government, and for the first time I can remember, it’s not just a two-horse race. The Liberal Democrats appear to have got a foot in the door, and from a Northeast perspective, I’m seeing the Greens field more candidates than I can recall in a previous election.\nMy personal politics have swung sharply to the left over the last year – see the earlier post on The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists for at least one reason. The book was an eye-opener for me, not just to left-wing politics, but also, indirectly, to other spheres of alternative culture – social justice and sustainability, to name a couple. The Greens, therefore, should be the party for whom I’m voting. Alas, the good old First-Past-The-Post system ensures that I, and doubtless many other Northeasterners who aren’t lucky enough to live on Tyneside, cannot show the support to this party that I’d wish. It’s at least thankful that I do have this option in the local elections, also taking place tomorrow.\nSo to whom will I be giving my support?\nThe Conservative Party have appeared, over this campaign, to be the antithesis of what I believe in. David Cameron rarely appears to be genuine; merely a person who knows what to say, but only when it’s scripted and he’s been able to prepare. In thinking on his feet, he has faltered. He might have some talent for rhetoric, scrub up well, and look the part – but there’s a word for that – Acting. Sure, he’s good at it, but that’s not the mark of a statesperson. More to the point, I’m not a capitalist. “Traditional values” are not something that I prize for the sake of tradition. I care not for fox-hunting; I don’t want its ban repealed. I care not for marriage, and the Conservative plans to put marriage on a pedestal in the tax system are unfair to both those who don’t wish to be married, and to those who find relationships difficult to obtain or sustain. The terrible truth is that such people are left to feel bad about themselves when marriage is promoted as the good, proper thing to do.\nFurthermore, the nature of the Conservatives’ attitude to sexual freedom has been widely criticised over the campaign, not least because of this person, which was only one of many stories in the press showing Conservatives, some very senior, to be fairly homophobic. I can only hope this hasn’t gone unnoticed by too many.\nThe Labour Party have had thirteen years to change the country, after promising the same for four General Elections. It wasn’t a surprise that they won in 1997 – a whole generation of voters had grown up under Conservative rule, which became increasingly unpopular, and the relatively young, energetic persona of Tony Blair was always going to defeat the grey-faced, dull image of John Major, whatever you may have thought of either. But the Blairite (or perhaps Blair-Right) politics of New Labour looked distinctly Conservative, so no major change occurred. But this had been on the cards, some might have felt, after the removal of Clause IV from Labour’s constitution, which saw the party move from being one with explicit socialist aims, to one paying mere lip-service to the working classes. Thirteen years with no change. Or perhaps that’s not true. In 1997 the economy was relatively stable, and we weren’t in any deeply unpopular wars. Change, indeed. So, no vote for Labour either.\nAny party with nationalist agendas (UKIP, the BNP, the National Front, and the English Democrats) will never get my vote. I know well the value of a multicultural society. Those who impugn it are simply, in my opinion, ignorant.\nSo, it’s the Liberal Democrats. Something of a protest vote, something of a tactical vote, something of a belief that the two main parties are resembling the pigs and farmers at the end of Animal Farm, and something does need to change. It maybe that a Liberal government would end up not offering such; in fact, if the television debates have changed my mind about anything, it’s that Nick Clegg appears as scripted as the other two leaders. But without the Green option, it appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament, and all that really changes is the voting system, as some commentators have speculated.\nBut in spirit, I’ll be backing the Green Party.\nThe 2015 General Election | Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nMay 3, 2015 at 5:44 pm\n[…] before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the […]",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_education/content_99.html": "Poetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nUniversity Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_writing/content_55.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nTo Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might. And to force a rule in this situation would be Linguistic Nazism, and I’ll have to truck with that.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now.

It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nOut of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010\nVoices\nBeen a while since I posted. Time for a poem, I think.\nVoices\nI have some voices in my head\nThat tell me what to do.\nTheir names are Jub, and Flib, and Xed,\nThere’s Grimp and Weeble, too.\nOne day the voices said to me,\n“Hey Johnny, listen close,\nYou have to make a cup of tea,\nAnd then some buttered toast”.\nSo off I went to make my drink,\nObedient and dumb,\nI never even stopped to think\nWhat harm to me might come.\nBut ‘cos the tea had been so nice,\nThe voices gained my trust.\nEach day I’d hear from them twice,\nDid what they said I must.\nBut then one fateful day, they said,\n“Hey Johnny, listen here:\nYou must shoot someone in the head,\nAnd we’ll give you some beer.”\nI found a gun with perfect ease.\nAnd then a victim, too.\nI gave the trigger such a squeeze\nIt turned my fingers blue.\nThe fellow’s brains went everywhere,\nThe room was red as hell.\nThe took me into special care –\nA private padded cell.\nNow you might ask me if I rue\nThe mess that got me here.\nAnd I would say, “Of course I do –\nI never got the beer!”\n© John Appleton 2010\nThe Zombie King\nI’m quite liking the sestina verse form – the same six words (or syllables) are used, in a specific pattern, to end the lines of each stanza, and also have a specific placing in the envoi. It’s like poetic sudoku. Here’s a vague attempt…\nThe Zombie King\nIt was a dark and stormy night,\nAnd shuffling in his earthy grave,\nThe figure of the Zombie King\nWas baying for a feast of blood.\nThe Grand High Priest of all the dead\nWould soon arise to seek his prey.\n‘Twas weeks since last he’d taken prey;\nAt last, a storm had come that night.\nThe wet ground stirred the Evil Dead,\nand made them restless in the grave.\nAnd one was hungry for some blood:\nIt was, of course, the Zombie King.\nAnd on the prowl, the Zombie King\nAt last had spotted tasty prey.\nA pure soul, whose virgin blood\nWould be a feast to make his night.\nThe girl stood by her father’s grave,\nAnd cried, and wished he wasn’t dead.\nBut now the Lord of all Undead,\nThe evil, mindless Zombie King,\nCrept silently toward the grave,\nWith eyes set firmly on his prey.\nIt was to be her final night;\nHe licked his lips: at last, some blood!\nHe pounced on her, it chilled her blood.\nHer screams amused the living dead,\nWhose laughter echoed through the night.\nAnd while she lay there, panicking,\nShe had one choice: to hope and pray\nShe wouldn’t die on Daddy’s grave.\nHe pinned his victim to the grave,\nWith yellow fangs he drew her blood.\nA tasty meal, his virgin prey,\nAnd soon the hapless girl was dead.\nA triumph for the Zombie King,\nUpon that dark and stormy night.\nBack in the grave, the Evil Dead\nWere drunk on blood, and hailed their King,\nAnd prayed for more another night.\n© John Appleton 2009",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04_15_deaths-in-sport/content_186.html": "Deaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nHave your say!",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_uncategorized/content_151.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nApples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nDesert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nTo Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might. And to force a rule in this situation would be Linguistic Nazism, and I’ll have to truck with that.\nDesert Island Albums\nOne problem with the whole desert-island-whatever thing is that, if you knew you were going to be stranded, possibly for years, with only about ten records, books, or whatever, you’d have to be pragmatic. Although the idea is that you choose your favourite ten, common sense would suggest otherwise. You’d probably want a bit of variety. You might be a big Led Zeppelin fan, for instance, but surely, for the whole time you were stuck on that island, you wouldn’t want all nine of their studio albums plus a compilation. You’d want something different on occasion. II and IV would probably suffice, possibly with Physical Graffiti if you didn’t think you could live without Kashmir.\nSo, this list of albums isn’t necessarily my 10 favourites. It’s probably closer to a list of favoured artists. I’ve made a few rules for this: firstly, no compilation albums. Greatest Hitses, Very Best Ofs and Now That’s What I Calls all feel a bit like cheating here. Secondly, no box sets, as they similarly feel like they don’t hit the spirit of the thing.\nAnd I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The reserves will be those that, should I find myself about to be stranded on a desert island with my record collection in front of me, I’d take if any of the main ten couldn’t be found. That seems fair. So, in no particular order:\nGeneration Terrorist – Manic Street Preachers\nFor those poor souls who think the Manics’ career began when A Design For Life made it big, let me educate you on something. That single was from their fourth album – which saw the beginning of the band’s slow collapse into nice commercial tunes. Before that, much of their creative genius came from Richey Edwards – a man often described as “troubled” by the press (not without cause – look up the 4 REAL incident), and who is now missing, presumed dead. And this first album might surprise those who so loved the strings and nice, friendly, pop guitars of their Everything Must Go offering. Because it’s brash, and full of anti-establishment sentiment. Motorcycle Emptiness will always be its best-known track, but You Love Us and Little Baby Nothing are right up there with it.\nA Night at the Opera – Queen\nEven if Greatest Hitses were allowed, this would still come in front of any of Queen’s compilations, for me. It was the album that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody (everybody’s favourite headbanging-in-cars tune), You’re My Best Friend and the questionable I’m in Love with my Car. But even these won’t stand out to everyone as the best – Death on Two Legs is wonderfully angry, and will probably remind you of every boss you ever hated. The Prophet’s Song is the ultimate murder-ballad, being eerie and apocalyptic. To counter these, we have the more jolly Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendezvous. It’s hard to imagine an album with a greater variety (especially as Bo-Rap itself has about six musical genres in one song). There’s not a bad track on the whole album, and to add to its brilliance, Brian May even plays ukulele on Good Company.\nMonster – R.E.M.\nNow then.\nTo my mind, this is the finest album ever made. And it will always remain so. No arguments, final word, no phoning a friend. Many will disagree – there were numerous music critics who thought that because it didn’t have the mainstream appeal of Out of Time or Automatic for the People, it wasn’t worth bothering about. Morons, I say. It’s certainly rockier than the previous two offerings, but hey, good bands should always be versatile. Crush with Eyeliner is my stand-out track, a gorgeous anti-love ballad, if that makes any sense. We have the better-known What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?, probably the only song ever based on a line shouted at a CBS anchorman by someone assaulting him with a bat. We have the lovely falsetto Tongue, Strange Currencies and number of other songs on themes of love, sex and identity, all as grungy and decadent as a diesel cheesecake. Buy it, now.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – David Bowie\nSo many Bowie albums to choose from, that I would be tempted to break the Greatest Hits rule. But if I had to pick one, it’d be this long-titled offering from the King of Glam. Even the cover of the LP is iconic, our Dave in his glam gear in Heddon Street, London. Ziggy Stardust, one of my favourite Bowie tracks, is the best on this album, but it’s in good company with Suffragette City and Starman – who can forgot the controversy this song caused when Bowie sang it on Top of the Pops, having the audacity to put his arm around Mick Ronson WHEN KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING. What sick filth, call the Daily Mail immediately. Before house prices drop or this blog gives you cancer.\nTwo Penny Opera – The Tiger Lillies\nA little-known band, but one with a worldwide following, and probably the band I’ve seen live the most. This is just one of the nigh-on thirty albums of theirs so far. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who might be easily offended, or might want to play the record in front of children, churchgoers or potential employers – especially if you’re after a Sunday School job. Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.\nNorth-East Skinny Dip\nYes. You read that right. Hopefully it’ll be a world record for the biggest number of naked idiots jumping into the sea at once. That’s gotta be worth a few sponsorship pounds.\nThe North-East Skinny Dip is taking place on Saturday 22nd September at very silly o’clock in the morning, in the North Sea (see idiots comment earlier). We’re doing it for a very worthy charity (MIND, a national mental health charity), as well as for an cracking answer to the question, “So, done anything interesting lately?”. I think it’s difficult to beat.\nBut here’s the important bit where I try to get you to part with your hard-earned: There’s a single sponsorship page (under one person’s name, but it all goes to the same charity), so that we don’t all have to mess about with creating hundreds of JustGiving pages (and so that if you know more than one of us but want to sponsor us all, that’s easier). Anyway, to make the sponsorship link nice and easy to spot, here it is in stupidly big format:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nThanks in advance if you do choose to donate some cash to this very worthy cause. Alternatively, if you’d actually like to take part, the registration site is here (and see the link to the Facebook event page above – invite your friends – or your enemies). Wish us luck!\nDeaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nLas Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?\nNational Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_swimming/content_179.html": "Apples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nNorth East Skinny Dip 2013\nSeeing as last year’s event was so much fun, I’ve once again signed up to do the fabulous North East Skinny Dip!\nThis year, the event takes place on Sunday September 21st at sunrise, at the beautiful Druridge Bay in Northumberland.\nThis time around I can attest to how fantastic an experience it is. The water wasn’t particularly cold, and believe me, you don’t have to worry about anyone judging your imperfect body – if one thing is obvious at these events, it’s that nobody is perfect. It’s all about having some free-spirited fun, and raising some cash for charity.\nWanna join us? If so, here’s the registration page. It only costs a £10 to register.\nIf you don’t quite think you have the bottle, but still want to support the excellent mental health charity Mind, then here’s the oversized attention-seeking link:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nGo on, you only live once.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now. Anyway, in honour of the recent North-East Skinny Dip, an Anacreontic ode (good for upbeat celebration of something so free-spirited) on the fun we had…\nEau Naturel\nTwenty-second of September!\nWhat a morning to remember!\nScores of people in the nip,\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\nThere we stood at Druridge Bay,\nAt the very break of day.\nWaiting on the icy sand,\nDipping hour close at hand.\nFinally we got the call:\n“Okay, dippers – bear it all!”\nOff it came, right then and there,\nEverybody’s underwear.\nLiberated from our clothes,\nOff we ran, with frozen toes\nStraight into the foaming brine,\nAs the sun began to shine.\nHordes of people filled the sea,\nIn the name of charity.\nMen and women, young and old,\nBody sizes manifold.\nDodging waves, we swam about,\nFree and easy, wearing nowt.\nAll around were laughs and hoots,\nFrom the folk in birthday suits.\nProud to show their naked forms,\nChallenging the social norms.\nNot a body part seemed rude,\nWith so many in the nude.\nOnce we all had swum enough,\nOut we stumbled, in the buff.\nClothed and warm, we got some scran\nFrom the handy burger van.\nThis much needed body heat\nPut some feeling in my feet.\nBack home, I was pleased to find\nLoads of money raised for Mind;\nTV, radio and papers\nCovering our naked capers.\nBest of all, I think I’ve grown,\nChallenging my comfort zone –\nFor I’d had the guts to strip\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\n© John Appleton 2012\nNude Glorious Nude\n(Oliver-based title pun, ‘cos the production currently at Newcastle Theatre Royal is very worth seeing. But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_baseball/content_87.html": "Boardroom Quotas\nNovember 17, 2015 at 4:11 pm (Politics) (Baseball, Politics, Racism, Sexism, Social Justice, Sport)\nThe idea of boardroom quotas, or any kind of employment quotas for women, will probably always be contentious. Accusations of “positive discrimination” will fly around, even from progressive people. I can understand both sides of this argument.\nBut let’s look at the idea of quotas from another angle.\nBack in the 1940s, Major League Baseball in the US had an unofficial colour bar. There was nothing in the laws of the sport to prevent a Major League team from playing a black man, but it was something that just didn’t happen. There were many black players, but these men had to content themsleves with playing in the Negro leagues.\nHowever, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, knew that there was a vast amount of talent in the Negro leagues, and thought it foolish that he couldn’t use their talent due to an unwritten rule of the sport. So he decided that he would sign a single black player, to prove that their inclusion could benefit the game, rather than spoil it.\nThe player he chose was Jackie Robinson. On April 15th 1947, Robinson made his Major League debut. The debut was not a remarkable one (regarding his performance at least), but over the summer he grew to be a hit with fans and media. Other clubs took notice. Slowly, the colour bar crumbled and fell. Today, April 15th is celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day, his shirt number (42) is the only one retired from all MLB teams, and to look at any Major League team, no-one would imagine that there was ever an issue with racial inclusion in the sport.\nBranch Rickey had essentially given himself a quota. One might say this was positive discrimination, that a white man might have lost his place in the team due to tokenism. One might also argue that Jackie Robinson might have been as good, or better than that white man, and was therefore deserving of his place. But this is a major point in my argument – it was important for Rickey to find a black player who would be a success and who could honestly say that he’d earned the right to be part of the team. Had he chosen just any black player for the sake of inclusion, that player might have proved a bad choice – which would have set the whole issue far back.\nThe issue of female quotas bears little difference to this – if a woman’s skills prove that she is good enough, a quota should not be an issue. It may indeed prevent a man from getting the same job because of his gender – but what’s often forgotten is that to redress any inequality, one must take an action that is itself unequal. Looking at it mathematically, if we have two numbers, 3 and 5, which we want to make equal, we must do something to one number that we don’t do to the other.\nThis is why we have International Women’s Day but don’t really bother with the male equivalent. It’s why we have an LGBT rights movement and not a straight/cis rights movement. Use the term “positive discrimination” all you like, but take a moment to remember what “positive” means. It’s not necessarily a bad thing.",

Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_01_08_to-think-upon-thy-words/content_36.html": "To Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might. And to force a rule in this situation would be Linguistic Nazism, and I’ll have to truck with that.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_05_30_euro-2012-a-cynics-predictions/content_65.html": "Euro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_06/content_68.html": "Artistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.\nThe English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.\nLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate…\nRight, just a random post to establish some sort of presence. There will be something with actual substance posted later.\nBy way of an explanation, the title here is apparently from the original Italian of Dante’s Divine Comedy. “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” Possibly more portentous than need be, but they can both be recited in iambic pentameter if you try hard enough. Rock.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_11/content_47.html": "Boardroom Quotas\nNovember 17, 2015 at 4:11 pm (Politics) (Baseball, Politics, Racism, Sexism, Social Justice, Sport)\nThe idea of boardroom quotas, or any kind of employment quotas for women, will probably always be contentious. Accusations of “positive discrimination” will fly around, even from progressive people. I can understand both sides of this argument.\nBut let’s look at the idea of quotas from another angle.\nBack in the 1940s, Major League Baseball in the US had an unofficial colour bar. There was nothing in the laws of the sport to prevent a Major League team from playing a black man, but it was something that just didn’t happen. There were many black players, but these men had to content themsleves with playing in the Negro leagues.\nHowever, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, knew that there was a vast amount of talent in the Negro leagues, and thought it foolish that he couldn’t use their talent due to an unwritten rule of the sport. So he decided that he would sign a single black player, to prove that their inclusion could benefit the game, rather than spoil it.\nThe player he chose was Jackie Robinson. On April 15th 1947, Robinson made his Major League debut. The debut was not a remarkable one (regarding his performance at least), but over the summer he grew to be a hit with fans and media. Other clubs took notice. Slowly, the colour bar crumbled and fell. Today, April 15th is celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day, his shirt number (42) is the only one retired from all MLB teams, and to look at any Major League team, no-one would imagine that there was ever an issue with racial inclusion in the sport.\nBranch Rickey had essentially given himself a quota. One might say this was positive discrimination, that a white man might have lost his place in the team due to tokenism. One might also argue that Jackie Robinson might have been as good, or better than that white man, and was therefore deserving of his place. But this is a major point in my argument – it was important for Rickey to find a black player who would be a success and who could honestly say that he’d earned the right to be part of the team. Had he chosen just any black player for the sake of inclusion, that player might have proved a bad choice – which would have set the whole issue far back.\nThe issue of female quotas bears little difference to this – if a woman’s skills prove that she is good enough, a quota should not be an issue. It may indeed prevent a man from getting the same job because of his gender – but what’s often forgotten is that to redress any inequality, one must take an action that is itself unequal. Looking at it mathematically, if we have two numbers, 3 and 5, which we want to make equal, we must do something to one number that we don’t do to the other.\nThis is why we have International Women’s Day but don’t really bother with the male equivalent. It’s why we have an LGBT rights movement and not a straight/cis rights movement. Use the term “positive discrimination” all you like, but take a moment to remember what “positive” means. It’s not necessarily a bad thing.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2014_08_30_the-scottish-referendum/content_216.html": "The Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_10_31_out-of-date/content_221.html": "Out of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_football/content_49.html": "Paulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nEuro 2012 and Racism\nThe main element of bad press for Euro 2012 at the moment is racism. Not so much the whole John Terry/Rio Ferdinand story (personally, I’d have left both of them out of the squad; they’re past it now in my opinion); more the attitudes of the Polish and Ukrainian supporters. Racist attitudes, that is, of the sort that hasn’t been seen (to any great extent, at least) in English football since the 80s.\nAmong the numerous stories, we have players saying that they, or their whole teams, will leave the pitch if they receive racist abuse. We have Michel Platini stating that players will be booked if they do that (I believe that referees can book players for leaving the pitch without permission anyway). He’s had his critics for this, as one might expect – such a stance will always look soft on racism. But I’m not entirely sure that leaving the pitch (or indeed the entire tournament, as some have suggested) is the right thing to do. Let me explain.\nI’ll try to put this in some perspective first. Footballers will always, rightly or wrongly, receive abuse from fans. Indeed, I dished some out in my last blog post (though I would hope it’s taken as being tongue-in-cheek). And it needn’t be racist abuse. It might be to do with nationality, height, (perceived) sexuality, religion, weight, hair colour, criminal convictions, their invented illegitimacy, anything. Race is just one of these things. It just so happens that, for whatever reason, the general public in this country are more sensitive to racial abuse than to other forms – even though other forms of abuse can be taken to heart to the same extent that racism can be.\nBecause racism is seen to be worse, a footballer can be banned for numerous matches because of a racist taunt (as Luis Suárez was, for eight games, this season). But I’ve yet to see a player banned for any other sort of taunt to another player, and you’d have to be a fool to think that it doesn’t happen. Fans, too, can get bans or criminal convictions for racist abuse, but not for other forms. Players will make official complaints where racial taunting goes on, but again, not for other forms of abuse. On those occasions, they’d be expected to not let the abuse get to them, and to carry on the game as normal – whether the abuse comes from players or fans.\nIn my opinion, that’s the right attitude to take – don’t let it get to you. As children, we’re taught mantras such as “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We’re told to disregard bullies, as a reaction is exactly what they want. The racism problem of Euro 2012 is simply playground bullying writ large. Those handing out the abuse (who were probably the bullies in the playground, and probably haven’t grown up much since), whether players or fans, are looking for a reaction. They want to disrupt the rightful order of things for their own entertainment or gain. By giving a reaction, the racists are getting what they want. And if games are abandoned, we’d be punishing innocent people – those fans who have spent large amounts of flights, hotels, tickets, et cetera. The racists have their fun, the true fans lose their money and a chance to see their team, and the sports stars deny themselves their right to compete at the highest level in the continent. How can this be right in any way?\nThe point is this. Platini’s stance makes it sound like he wants to ignore racism entirely (and he might – I don’t exactly know him personally). But there’s a difference between ignoring something, and not allowing it to affect you. Teams certainly cannot ignore racism – but they can keep a cool head, maintain the moral high ground, and not allow the bastards to grind them down. The complaints can be made after the game, and we’d have to trust UEFA (I know that might be difficult) to mete out punishments to the FAs or clubs involved (as they did with Liverpool after the Heysel disaster). Theoretically, that should see the right people punished – not the true fans or the players.\nEuro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nPoppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_01_08_to-think-upon-thy-words/content_114.html": "To Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might.

I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nRetrospection | Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nFebruary 16, 2014 at 8:12 pm\n[…] A break in the Lake District, firstly staying in Keswick and seeing some of the finest theatre I’ve ever witnessed, at the […]",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_politics_page_2/content_160.html": "Euro 2012 and Racism\nThe main element of bad press for Euro 2012 at the moment is racism. Not so much the whole John Terry/Rio Ferdinand story (personally, I’d have left both of them out of the squad; they’re past it now in my opinion); more the attitudes of the Polish and Ukrainian supporters. Racist attitudes, that is, of the sort that hasn’t been seen (to any great extent, at least) in English football since the 80s.\nAmong the numerous stories, we have players saying that they, or their whole teams, will leave the pitch if they receive racist abuse. We have Michel Platini stating that players will be booked if they do that (I believe that referees can book players for leaving the pitch without permission anyway). He’s had his critics for this, as one might expect – such a stance will always look soft on racism. But I’m not entirely sure that leaving the pitch (or indeed the entire tournament, as some have suggested) is the right thing to do. Let me explain.\nI’ll try to put this in some perspective first. Footballers will always, rightly or wrongly, receive abuse from fans. Indeed, I dished some out in my last blog post (though I would hope it’s taken as being tongue-in-cheek). And it needn’t be racist abuse. It might be to do with nationality, height, (perceived) sexuality, religion, weight, hair colour, criminal convictions, their invented illegitimacy, anything. Race is just one of these things. It just so happens that, for whatever reason, the general public in this country are more sensitive to racial abuse than to other forms – even though other forms of abuse can be taken to heart to the same extent that racism can be.\nBecause racism is seen to be worse, a footballer can be banned for numerous matches because of a racist taunt (as Luis Suárez was, for eight games, this season). But I’ve yet to see a player banned for any other sort of taunt to another player, and you’d have to be a fool to think that it doesn’t happen. Fans, too, can get bans or criminal convictions for racist abuse, but not for other forms. Players will make official complaints where racial taunting goes on, but again, not for other forms of abuse. On those occasions, they’d be expected to not let the abuse get to them, and to carry on the game as normal – whether the abuse comes from players or fans.\nIn my opinion, that’s the right attitude to take – don’t let it get to you. As children, we’re taught mantras such as “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We’re told to disregard bullies, as a reaction is exactly what they want. The racism problem of Euro 2012 is simply playground bullying writ large. Those handing out the abuse (who were probably the bullies in the playground, and probably haven’t grown up much since), whether players or fans, are looking for a reaction. They want to disrupt the rightful order of things for their own entertainment or gain. By giving a reaction, the racists are getting what they want. And if games are abandoned, we’d be punishing innocent people – those fans who have spent large amounts of flights, hotels, tickets, et cetera. The racists have their fun, the true fans lose their money and a chance to see their team, and the sports stars deny themselves their right to compete at the highest level in the continent. How can this be right in any way?\nThe point is this. Platini’s stance makes it sound like he wants to ignore racism entirely (and he might – I don’t exactly know him personally). But there’s a difference between ignoring something, and not allowing it to affect you. Teams certainly cannot ignore racism – but they can keep a cool head, maintain the moral high ground, and not allow the bastards to grind them down. The complaints can be made after the game, and we’d have to trust UEFA (I know that might be difficult) to mete out punishments to the FAs or clubs involved (as they did with Liverpool after the Heysel disaster). Theoretically, that should see the right people punished – not the true fans or the players.\nPoppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.\nReligion\nThis post has been inspired by a question asked on the Sunderland Green Party forum recently, and I thought it might be worth a blog post, as religion is something that interests me, in terms of how it affects me and society. The question is thus:\nWhat role should religion play…?\n1. In the lives of yourself and others\n2. In politics / public debate and policy\nThe first question: A simple answer is that it probably shouldn’t have to have any role, although even in this day and age, it doubtlessly will, even if by minor degrees. Days of the week, for instance, being named for deities. The England flags ubiquitous during international football tournaments have a Christian cross upon them. Streets, schools and other places are often named for saints or other religious figures. Of course, these are just roses by other names, and probably don’t have any influence on ourselves or society to any great extent.\nThen, of course, there are those aspects of religion that do have a part in our lives, and affect the things we do – even if we’re not religious. We take Good Friday and Easter Monday off work, for instance. In the past we’ve been restricted by Sunday trading laws. And I can confidently predict that later in the year, myself (a Pagan) and my friends Nigel (an atheist) and Charlotte (a Jew) will be sitting around a table in a pub swapping Christmas presents. We also have some very major religious influences. Extremism, terrorism, war – in this way, religion has affected everybody from Holocaust victims to those people prevented from taking liquids onto aeroplanes. In vastly different ways, of course, but religion has been there; if not as a direct cause, then as an excuse. These are roles that religion plays in our lives regardless of whether or not one has a religion. Where a person does subscribe to a faith, however, its influence will be even more profound – though not necessarily on the same level. It really depends upon how a person sees their religion.\nSome will see their religion as a philosophy, or set of philosophies, to explain life, the universe and everything. In this respect, it probably differs only from atheism in the presence of some supreme being or entity. This may be enough to play a serious role in a person’s life. Reverence of nature is part of Druid belief, and subscription to that faith may well encourage somebody to be more kind to nature. But there is also a legislative aspect to many religions. Christianity has many laws, for want of a better word. The best known of these are the Ten Commandments, though the bible, in particular the Old Testament, is full of many others. Many will see it important to keep to such tenets, as a way of keeping faith or attaining some higher station (entering Heaven, for instance). This can be a positive thing if it encourages such things as friendliness and respect, but not so good if it represses natural tendencies, such as alternate sexualities.\nReligious law, however, raises a good question concerning personal freedom. Yes, a person has freedom of religion – but should a person be free to believe in something that prevents them from being themselves (and therefore even more free)? The argument over niqabs is a classic example – is it a woman’s right to subscribe to a religion that compels her to wear one, or is it a woman’s right to bear her face in public regardless?\nHowever, the second question is a little different. I’d agree that people have a right to religion (you can’t stop people believing what they want anyway, metaphysical or otherwise), though I don’t think it has a place in politics. Religion is, after all, a belief, not a proven fact, and it would be highly irresponsible of any government to allow blind faith to affect its decisions. Any metaphysical theory has only a minute chance of ever being correct, and faith itself is very arbitrary. Therefore, laws enacted in the name of faith are arbitrary. In Tudor England, for example, Catholics were executed as heretics when Protestants were in power; when the Catholics ruled, Protestants were executed. Clearly, government cannot be fair if it is based upon the unproven beliefs of whomever might be in power. Such beliefs do not even have to be religious, of course – McCarthyism brought the same sort of issues as the Salem Witch Trials.\nGovernment must work upon what is known. We know that condoms prevent death and disease. We do not know if there is a deity out there who will banish us unto eternal torment for using them. In reality, it’s just as possible (and as improbable) that there is a deity out there ready to grant us eternal paradise for the same thing. If there were proof, of course, that Hell awaited us for such an act, there’d be reason for our government to protect our eternal souls. But unless we have that, we cannot make laws on blind assumptions – religious or not.\nOf course, this isn’t to say that a state’s laws should not make any reference to religion at all. It should still be realised that people have a right to religion, and a right to practise it. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people can do so equally. I’ve long thought it a shame that the Bank Holiday schedule in England is mostly based around Christian festivals (even if they’re only there to suppress Pagan ones). A Muslim might be happy to be given Easter off, if for no other reason than a break from work, but would that same person be happy to be working through Ramadan? (if you’re a Muslim, I’d be interested in your thoughts on that – not being one, I can’t answer it. You get the idea, anyway).\nHaving said this, it often irritates me that religion is often given an untouchable status, whereas other forms of philosophy are not. For example, if an employee refused to work a Sunday to attend church, many employers would submit to that, for fear of being labelled politically incorrect (at best). But I doubt the same would apply to somebody who wished to attend a political event, no matter how fervent their belief. If we recognise religious freedom in the law, we should also recognise other philosophical freedoms.\nSlutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.\nUniversity Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.\nThe 2010 General Election\nIt feels like there’s something important about tomorrow’s General Election. Perhaps it’s simply because over the past year or so, I’ve been more acutely aware of politics in Britain, and indeed the world. Not just from a point of view of Westminster/Capitol Hill, but also from a point of view of the grass roots of society, and how they’re treated by the higher classes. Perhaps it’s because there have been some major events that transcended the purely political and the ordinary – The economic crisis is seen on the streets, it’s talked of in Whitehall as a major issue. Barrack Obama’s healthcare reforms have divided America, from the unemployed to the whatever the US might consider their aristocracy. Perhaps, it’s just because we look like we’re in for a change of government, and for the first time I can remember, it’s not just a two-horse race. The Liberal Democrats appear to have got a foot in the door, and from a Northeast perspective, I’m seeing the Greens field more candidates than I can recall in a previous election.\nMy personal politics have swung sharply to the left over the last year – see the earlier post on The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists for at least one reason. The book was an eye-opener for me, not just to left-wing politics, but also, indirectly, to other spheres of alternative culture – social justice and sustainability, to name a couple. The Greens, therefore, should be the party for whom I’m voting. Alas, the good old First-Past-The-Post system ensures that I, and doubtless many other Northeasterners who aren’t lucky enough to live on Tyneside, cannot show the support to this party that I’d wish. It’s at least thankful that I do have this option in the local elections, also taking place tomorrow.\nSo to whom will I be giving my support?\nThe Conservative Party have appeared, over this campaign, to be the antithesis of what I believe in. David Cameron rarely appears to be genuine; merely a person who knows what to say, but only when it’s scripted and he’s been able to prepare. In thinking on his feet, he has faltered. He might have some talent for rhetoric, scrub up well, and look the part – but there’s a word for that – Acting. Sure, he’s good at it, but that’s not the mark of a statesperson. More to the point, I’m not a capitalist. “Traditional values” are not something that I prize for the sake of tradition. I care not for fox-hunting; I don’t want its ban repealed. I care not for marriage, and the Conservative plans to put marriage on a pedestal in the tax system are unfair to both those who don’t wish to be married, and to those who find relationships difficult to obtain or sustain. The terrible truth is that such people are left to feel bad about themselves when marriage is promoted as the good, proper thing to do.\nFurthermore, the nature of the Conservatives’ attitude to sexual freedom has been widely criticised over the campaign, not least because of this person, which was only one of many stories in the press showing Conservatives, some very senior, to be fairly homophobic. I can only hope this hasn’t gone unnoticed by too many.\nThe Labour Party have had thirteen years to change the country, after promising the same for four General Elections. It wasn’t a surprise that they won in 1997 – a whole generation of voters had grown up under Conservative rule, which became increasingly unpopular, and the relatively young, energetic persona of Tony Blair was always going to defeat the grey-faced, dull image of John Major, whatever you may have thought of either. But the Blairite (or perhaps Blair-Right) politics of New Labour looked distinctly Conservative, so no major change occurred. But this had been on the cards, some might have felt, after the removal of Clause IV from Labour’s constitution, which saw the party move from being one with explicit socialist aims, to one paying mere lip-service to the working classes. Thirteen years with no change. Or perhaps that’s not true. In 1997 the economy was relatively stable, and we weren’t in any deeply unpopular wars. Change, indeed. So, no vote for Labour either.\nAny party with nationalist agendas (UKIP, the BNP, the National Front, and the English Democrats) will never get my vote. I know well the value of a multicultural society. Those who impugn it are simply, in my opinion, ignorant.\nSo, it’s the Liberal Democrats. Something of a protest vote, something of a tactical vote, something of a belief that the two main parties are resembling the pigs and farmers at the end of Animal Farm, and something does need to change. It maybe that a Liberal government would end up not offering such; in fact, if the television debates have changed my mind about anything, it’s that Nick Clegg appears as scripted as the other two leaders. But without the Green option, it appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament, and all that really changes is the voting system, as some commentators have speculated.\nBut in spirit, I’ll be backing the Green Party.\nFree Speech\nFree Speech – a lovely phrase. A democratic ideal, but perhaps unconsciously to many, one of those concepts that can all too often trigger an “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” response. Whilst many people will state that they agree with the idea of Free Speech, some of these will nonetheless call for the censorship of extreme views with which they do not approve. Two recent media events have been examples of Free Speech being used as a platform for views with which I certainly do not agree. This, of course, challenged me to consider my opinions on Free Speech.\nThe first of these incidents was Jan Moir’s repugnant Daily Mail article about the nature (or “unnature”, as she might have it), surrounding the death of Stephen Gately. This article, despite the fact that neither police nor coroner have ever suggested anything other than a death from natural causes, blamed his death on his homosexuality. Not in so many words, obviously – but the suggestion was plastered over the article. A massive internet backlash, lead by (among others) Derren Brown, Stephen Fry and a wonderfully scathing article by Charlie Brooker lead to a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission, and withdrawal of advertisments from the Daily Mail‘s website.\nThe second event was Nick Griffin’s appearance on Question Time. The BBC’s decision was criticised by many who considered that it would give the BNP more of a standing as a political party. I do wonder how many of such people would otherwise have defended free speech. In the event, Nick Griffin simply ended up making himself look like the uneducated bigot that many consider him to be – in showing a blatant ignorance of basic history and culture.\nBoth Nick Griffin and Jan Moir have expressed, on a vast public stage, opinions that to me are utterly despicable. But should they still be allowed to make these opinions public?\nHell yes.\nNick Griffin made himself look a fool. Jan Moir may have made a name for herself (I hadn’t previously heard of her), but it’s muddier than a Mississippi Mud Pie that’s fallen in Mud. I’m not sure who stated that “It’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt”, but I think that if we let the fools speak, it’s easier for us to recognise who they are. Intellectual evolution, really.\nThe English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_06_17_poetry-in-school/content_248.html": "Poetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_12_20_desert-island-albums/content_103.html": "Desert Island Albums\nOne problem with the whole desert-island-whatever thing is that, if you knew you were going to be stranded, possibly for years, with only about ten records, books, or whatever, you’d have to be pragmatic. Although the idea is that you choose your favourite ten, common sense would suggest otherwise. You’d probably want a bit of variety. You might be a big Led Zeppelin fan, for instance, but surely, for the whole time you were stuck on that island, you wouldn’t want all nine of their studio albums plus a compilation. You’d want something different on occasion. II and IV would probably suffice, possibly with Physical Graffiti if you didn’t think you could live without Kashmir.\nSo, this list of albums isn’t necessarily my 10 favourites. It’s probably closer to a list of favoured artists. I’ve made a few rules for this: firstly, no compilation albums. Greatest Hitses, Very Best Ofs and Now That’s What I Calls all feel a bit like cheating here. Secondly, no box sets, as they similarly feel like they don’t hit the spirit of the thing.\nAnd I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The reserves will be those that, should I find myself about to be stranded on a desert island with my record collection in front of me, I’d take if any of the main ten couldn’t be found. That seems fair. So, in no particular order:\nGeneration Terrorist – Manic Street Preachers\nFor those poor souls who think the Manics’ career began when A Design For Life made it big, let me educate you on something. That single was from their fourth album – which saw the beginning of the band’s slow collapse into nice commercial tunes. Before that, much of their creative genius came from Richey Edwards – a man often described as “troubled” by the press (not without cause – look up the 4 REAL incident), and who is now missing, presumed dead. And this first album might surprise those who so loved the strings and nice, friendly, pop guitars of their Everything Must Go offering. Because it’s brash, and full of anti-establishment sentiment. Motorcycle Emptiness will always be its best-known track, but You Love Us and Little Baby Nothing are right up there with it.\nA Night at the Opera – Queen\nEven if Greatest Hitses were allowed, this would still come in front of any of Queen’s compilations, for me. It was the album that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody (everybody’s favourite headbanging-in-cars tune), You’re My Best Friend and the questionable I’m in Love with my Car. But even these won’t stand out to everyone as the best – Death on Two Legs is wonderfully angry, and will probably remind you of every boss you ever hated. The Prophet’s Song is the ultimate murder-ballad, being eerie and apocalyptic. To counter these, we have the more jolly Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendezvous. It’s hard to imagine an album with a greater variety (especially as Bo-Rap itself has about six musical genres in one song). There’s not a bad track on the whole album, and to add to its brilliance, Brian May even plays ukulele on Good Company.\nMonster – R.E.M.\nNow then.\nTo my mind, this is the finest album ever made. And it will always remain so. No arguments, final word, no phoning a friend. Many will disagree – there were numerous music critics who thought that because it didn’t have the mainstream appeal of Out of Time or Automatic for the People, it wasn’t worth bothering about. Morons, I say. It’s certainly rockier than the previous two offerings, but hey, good bands should always be versatile. Crush with Eyeliner is my stand-out track, a gorgeous anti-love ballad, if that makes any sense. We have the better-known What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?, probably the only song ever based on a line shouted at a CBS anchorman by someone assaulting him with a bat. We have the lovely falsetto Tongue, Strange Currencies and number of other songs on themes of love, sex and identity, all as grungy and decadent as a diesel cheesecake. Buy it, now.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – David Bowie\nSo many Bowie albums to choose from, that I would be tempted to break the Greatest Hits rule. But if I had to pick one, it’d be this long-titled offering from the King of Glam. Even the cover of the LP is iconic, our Dave in his glam gear in Heddon Street, London. Ziggy Stardust, one of my favourite Bowie tracks, is the best on this album, but it’s in good company with Suffragette City and Starman – who can forgot the controversy this song caused when Bowie sang it on Top of the Pops, having the audacity to put his arm around Mick Ronson WHEN KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING. What sick filth, call the Daily Mail immediately. Before house prices drop or this blog gives you cancer.\nTwo Penny Opera – The Tiger Lillies\nA little-known band, but one with a worldwide following, and probably the band I’ve seen live the most. This is just one of the nigh-on thirty albums of theirs so far. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who might be easily offended, or might want to play the record in front of children, churchgoers or potential employers – especially if you’re after a Sunday School job. Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_06_08_euro-2012-and-racism/content_82.html": "Euro 2012 and Racism\nThe main element of bad press for Euro 2012 at the moment is racism. Not so much the whole John Terry/Rio Ferdinand story (personally, I’d have left both of them out of the squad; they’re past it now in my opinion); more the attitudes of the Polish and Ukrainian supporters. Racist attitudes, that is, of the sort that hasn’t been seen (to any great extent, at least) in English football since the 80s.\nAmong the numerous stories, we have players saying that they, or their whole teams, will leave the pitch if they receive racist abuse. We have Michel Platini stating that players will be booked if they do that (I believe that referees can book players for leaving the pitch without permission anyway). He’s had his critics for this, as one might expect – such a stance will always look soft on racism. But I’m not entirely sure that leaving the pitch (or indeed the entire tournament, as some have suggested) is the right thing to do. Let me explain.\nI’ll try to put this in some perspective first. Footballers will always, rightly or wrongly, receive abuse from fans. Indeed, I dished some out in my last blog post (though I would hope it’s taken as being tongue-in-cheek). And it needn’t be racist abuse. It might be to do with nationality, height, (perceived) sexuality, religion, weight, hair colour, criminal convictions, their invented illegitimacy, anything. Race is just one of these things. It just so happens that, for whatever reason, the general public in this country are more sensitive to racial abuse than to other forms – even though other forms of abuse can be taken to heart to the same extent that racism can be.\nBecause racism is seen to be worse, a footballer can be banned for numerous matches because of a racist taunt (as Luis Suárez was, for eight games, this season). But I’ve yet to see a player banned for any other sort of taunt to another player, and you’d have to be a fool to think that it doesn’t happen. Fans, too, can get bans or criminal convictions for racist abuse, but not for other forms. Players will make official complaints where racial taunting goes on, but again, not for other forms of abuse. On those occasions, they’d be expected to not let the abuse get to them, and to carry on the game as normal – whether the abuse comes from players or fans.\nIn my opinion, that’s the right attitude to take – don’t let it get to you. As children, we’re taught mantras such as “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We’re told to disregard bullies, as a reaction is exactly what they want. The racism problem of Euro 2012 is simply playground bullying writ large. Those handing out the abuse (who were probably the bullies in the playground, and probably haven’t grown up much since), whether players or fans, are looking for a reaction. They want to disrupt the rightful order of things for their own entertainment or gain. By giving a reaction, the racists are getting what they want. And if games are abandoned, we’d be punishing innocent people – those fans who have spent large amounts of flights, hotels, tickets, et cetera. The racists have their fun, the true fans lose their money and a chance to see their team, and the sports stars deny themselves their right to compete at the highest level in the continent. How can this be right in any way?\nThe point is this. Platini’s stance makes it sound like he wants to ignore racism entirely (and he might – I don’t exactly know him personally). But there’s a difference between ignoring something, and not allowing it to affect you. Teams certainly cannot ignore racism – but they can keep a cool head, maintain the moral high ground, and not allow the bastards to grind them down. The complaints can be made after the game, and we’d have to trust UEFA (I know that might be difficult) to mete out punishments to the FAs or clubs involved (as they did with Liverpool after the Heysel disaster). Theoretically, that should see the right people punished – not the true fans or the players.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_05_19_apples-on-tour-south-manchester/content_13.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nHave your say!",

We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nThe Zombie King\nI’m quite liking the sestina verse form – the same six words (or syllables) are used, in a specific pattern, to end the lines of each stanza, and also have a specific placing in the envoi.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_12_10_university-fees/content_251.html": "University Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.\nHave your say!",

In 2009 I moved to The Guardian where I’ve been since.\nI have become part of the online cruciverbalist community, regularly entering the Crossword Centre Clue-Writing Competition, which I’ve won once, and in whose annual competition I have been placed as high as fifth.\nI’m also an occasional contributor to Fifteen Squared, a website providing solutions and explanations to a number of publications’ puzzles. I’ve attended one of their Sloggers and Betters events to date, where I’ve met a number of the celebrities of the genre – who in all likelihood, no-one else has heard of.\nHave your say!",

These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches. Next year, perhaps…",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_02_19_ruth-ellis/content_238.html": "Ruth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nMonica Weller FRPS (@WellerMonica) said,\nMarch 7, 2015 at 11:10 pm\nI saw Amanda’s play when it was performed in 2013 at St James’s Theatre in London. As the ghost writer of RUTH ELLIS MY SISTER’S SECRET LIFE I was asked to write a piece for the programme that was on sale at the theatre. You are right in that the story needs to be told. You are not correct though in saying “There’s no doubt she committed the crime”.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_humour/content_130.html": "Night of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nEuro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_04/content_129.html": "Paulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_history/content_3.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_05_03_apples-on-tour-cambridge-and-east-anglia/content_33.html": "Apples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_05_31_national-vegetarian-week/content_167.html": "National Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.\nMark Harrison said,\nMay 31, 2010 at 3:15 pm\nI know your problems, I am far from Veggy, in fact i don’t really think it’s a meal with out meat.\nBut my girlfriend is and with this comes the problem of I have to eat where she can eat.\nShe is also very fussy so this can involve looking at several menus to find something she can eat and will eat.\nI on the other hand just have to settle for what ever i want from the place she will eat.\nthis can take aloonnnng time.\njust thank god she not a F@*king Vegan!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2014_06/content_48.html": "Washington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_10_26_free-speech/content_232.html": "Free Speech\nFree Speech – a lovely phrase. A democratic ideal, but perhaps unconsciously to many, one of those concepts that can all too often trigger an “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” response. Whilst many people will state that they agree with the idea of Free Speech, some of these will nonetheless call for the censorship of extreme views with which they do not approve. Two recent media events have been examples of Free Speech being used as a platform for views with which I certainly do not agree. This, of course, challenged me to consider my opinions on Free Speech.\nThe first of these incidents was Jan Moir’s repugnant Daily Mail article about the nature (or “unnature”, as she might have it), surrounding the death of Stephen Gately. This article, despite the fact that neither police nor coroner have ever suggested anything other than a death from natural causes, blamed his death on his homosexuality. Not in so many words, obviously – but the suggestion was plastered over the article. A massive internet backlash, lead by (among others) Derren Brown, Stephen Fry and a wonderfully scathing article by Charlie Brooker lead to a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission, and withdrawal of advertisments from the Daily Mail‘s website.\nThe second event was Nick Griffin’s appearance on Question Time. The BBC’s decision was criticised by many who considered that it would give the BNP more of a standing as a political party. I do wonder how many of such people would otherwise have defended free speech. In the event, Nick Griffin simply ended up making himself look like the uneducated bigot that many consider him to be – in showing a blatant ignorance of basic history and culture.\nBoth Nick Griffin and Jan Moir have expressed, on a vast public stage, opinions that to me are utterly despicable. But should they still be allowed to make these opinions public?\nHell yes.\nNick Griffin made himself look a fool. Jan Moir may have made a name for herself (I hadn’t previously heard of her), but it’s muddier than a Mississippi Mud Pie that’s fallen in Mud. I’m not sure who stated that “It’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt”, but I think that if we let the fools speak, it’s easier for us to recognise who they are. Intellectual evolution, really.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_06_02_slutwalks-your-thoughts-please/content_246.html": "Slutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.\nJennieB said,\nJune 3, 2011 at 11:32 am\nHaving XX chromosomes I may not be the best person to answer on how men feel about this. However, I think, like any protest/demo, that if the message isn’t clear it will be lost on the majority of passers by – be they chauvinist or simply perplexed. Leaflets and banners will help!\nI like the Manchester Slut Walk manifesto: aimed at people who self-define as ‘slut’ or not, the key message is about the right to dress how you want to without fear of attack. The SOPHIE campaign has pretty much the same message after the horrid and pointless murder of beautiful Sophie Lancaster (http://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com).\nI don’t define myself as a slut – that’s my own personal take – but respect the decision of those who do. I do hope that men take part too in solidarity; men who choose to portray themselves differently can also be threatened. Finally, I believe that men can be feminists just as much as women can (it’s about equality y’all).\nGreat article John, and I would never question Alan Shearer’s parentage 😉",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_horse-racing/content_196.html": "Deaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.",

And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_06_14_the-english-democrats-freedom-fail/content_107.html": "The English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.\nWayne K Jones said,\nJuly 14, 2009 at 11:24 pm\nYou have to admit that the UK’s immigration policy needs to be changed, perhaps implement a points system like USA or Australia.\nYes I’ve heard the ridiculous argument “english people wont do the crap jobs, so we need immigrant workers”. The truth is simply that they don’t pay enough; if there is no-one willing to do a job for a set wage, then increase the wage – supply and demand; not import workers!\nIt is (has?) destroying the economy and housing market!\noddbodd13 said,\nJuly 17, 2009 at 9:05 am\nImmigration policy possibly isn’t perfect, but it has to be remembered that our membership of the EU prohibits us having an absolute say in Immigration. To my mind, it’s good to allow people the freedom to move between countries for business or personal reasons. The EU allows this between member states. If people wish to come to England and earn a living, I’ve nothing against that.\nWhatever effect it may have on the economy and housing market, though, I think is little compared to what our own government has been steadily doing to it for years.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/content_9.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nThe 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nApples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nRuth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nThe Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.\nWashington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nRetrospection\nThe usual end-of-year roundup. And not a bad one.\nJanuary: Performance of The Day after the Fair at The Royalty, directed by little old me. Supremely proud of the production and the response it got.\nFebruary: Saw The Mousetrap. Baffled as to why it’s so famous.\nMarch: Trip to York to see Tara Fitzgerald in The Winter’s Tale. Worth the trip.\nApril: Performed in Proof at The Royalty, playing a Mathematician with mental issues. Worth seeing the film if you can.\nMay: Trip to Manchester for poetry, art and theatre. And real ale and and Hats. That’s like a holy pentanity, or something.\nJune: In the tech box for once, running lights for Deathtrap with Washington Theatre Group.\nJuly: A camping and swimming trip, around the Northumbrian Coast. Swam at Low Newton and Sugar Sands, freezing cold but worth every penny of the wetsuit. Became vice-chair of the Royalty Theatre.\nAugust: A break in the Lake District, firstly staying in Keswick and seeing some of the finest theatre I’ve ever witnessed, at the Theatre by the Lake. This was followed by some camping in Grizedale, now becoming a favourite camping haunt. And some swims in Grasmere and Rydal water, on warm sunny days in beautiful surroundings. Played the Caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland with Washington Theatre Group.\nSeptember: Another North-East Skinny Dip, preceded by an evening swim around the Farne Islands surrounded by seals. Easily the best experience of the year. Also, a trip to Brighton.\nOctober: Playing Lennie in Of Mice and Men at The Royalty; easily the biggest acting challenge I’ve ever had. Still surprised that I got through it.\nNovember: Finish playing Lennie. Suprised I got through it.\nDecember: Crosswords turn 100. Well, it’s a big deal to me.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_06_14_the-english-democrats-freedom-fail/content_117.html": "The English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.\nWayne K Jones said,\nJuly 14, 2009 at 11:24 pm\nYou have to admit that the UK’s immigration policy needs to be changed, perhaps implement a points system like USA or Australia.\nYes I’ve heard the ridiculous argument “english people wont do the crap jobs, so we need immigrant workers”. The truth is simply that they don’t pay enough; if there is no-one willing to do a job for a set wage, then increase the wage – supply and demand; not import workers!\nIt is (has?) destroying the economy and housing market!\noddbodd13 said,\nJuly 17, 2009 at 9:05 am\nImmigration policy possibly isn’t perfect, but it has to be remembered that our membership of the EU prohibits us having an absolute say in Immigration. To my mind, it’s good to allow people the freedom to move between countries for business or personal reasons. The EU allows this between member states. If people wish to come to England and earn a living, I’ve nothing against that.\nWhatever effect it may have on the economy and housing market, though, I think is little compared to what our own government has been steadily doing to it for years.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_11/content_156.html": "Poppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_horror/content_44.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_11_17_boardroom-quotas/content_28.html": "Boardroom Quotas\nNovember 17, 2015 at 4:11 pm (Politics) (Baseball, Politics, Racism, Sexism, Social Justice, Sport)\nThe idea of boardroom quotas, or any kind of employment quotas for women, will probably always be contentious. Accusations of “positive discrimination” will fly around, even from progressive people. I can understand both sides of this argument.\nBut let’s look at the idea of quotas from another angle.\nBack in the 1940s, Major League Baseball in the US had an unofficial colour bar. There was nothing in the laws of the sport to prevent a Major League team from playing a black man, but it was something that just didn’t happen. There were many black players, but these men had to content themsleves with playing in the Negro leagues.\nHowever, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, knew that there was a vast amount of talent in the Negro leagues, and thought it foolish that he couldn’t use their talent due to an unwritten rule of the sport. So he decided that he would sign a single black player, to prove that their inclusion could benefit the game, rather than spoil it.\nThe player he chose was Jackie Robinson. On April 15th 1947, Robinson made his Major League debut. The debut was not a remarkable one (regarding his performance at least), but over the summer he grew to be a hit with fans and media. Other clubs took notice. Slowly, the colour bar crumbled and fell. Today, April 15th is celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day, his shirt number (42) is the only one retired from all MLB teams, and to look at any Major League team, no-one would imagine that there was ever an issue with racial inclusion in the sport.\nBranch Rickey had essentially given himself a quota. One might say this was positive discrimination, that a white man might have lost his place in the team due to tokenism. One might also argue that Jackie Robinson might have been as good, or better than that white man, and was therefore deserving of his place. But this is a major point in my argument – it was important for Rickey to find a black player who would be a success and who could honestly say that he’d earned the right to be part of the team. Had he chosen just any black player for the sake of inclusion, that player might have proved a bad choice – which would have set the whole issue far back.\nThe issue of female quotas bears little difference to this – if a woman’s skills prove that she is good enough, a quota should not be an issue. It may indeed prevent a man from getting the same job because of his gender – but what’s often forgotten is that to redress any inequality, one must take an action that is itself unequal. Looking at it mathematically, if we have two numbers, 3 and 5, which we want to make equal, we must do something to one number that we don’t do to the other.\nThis is why we have International Women’s Day but don’t really bother with the male equivalent. It’s why we have an LGBT rights movement and not a straight/cis rights movement. Use the term “positive discrimination” all you like, but take a moment to remember what “positive” means. It’s not necessarily a bad thing.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_02_27_apples-on-tour-liverpool/content_207.html": "Apples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop. No time to visit Anfield, unfortunately, but I did at least get to watch Liverpool’s penalty shoot-out win in the League Cup Final. Come on you Reds.\nSo, I have not been disappointed by this eagerly-awaited trip. There’s probably a lot more to discover about Liverpool, as there always will be with any place. So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.\nNeen said,\nFebruary 28, 2012 at 11:19 pm\n🙂\nRetrospection « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 28, 2012 at 4:08 pm\n[…] Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.

Preferring to keep an open mind on this grand claim, I took to reading it. At this point it might be prudent to describe my political leanings at the time I began reading. Swinging both ways, really – of the opinion that neither Capitalism nor Socialism held all of the answers.\nFor those unfamiliar with the book, it depicts the lives of a group of workers for a painting and decorating firm in the South of England, in the very early 20th century. We see the conditions under which the men have to work, often oppressed by their profit-minded masters – forced to work as shoddily and cheaply as possible to maximise profits. We see the men’s home lives, and how their poverty affects their wives, parents and children – very little to eat, or indeed to wear. We see the opposite side, the corrupt, yet affluent, lives of the masters – affected Christianity and corrupt control of the means of production and of council business.\nThe book itself is an engaging enough novel, with its occasional comedy and tragedy. But its intent is certainly to be more than entertaining. Throughout the book we are treated to the vision of Owen, one of the labourers, trying to convert his fellow workers to Socialist ideals. The workers themselves, by and large, dismiss these ideas, despite the obvious benefits they’d reap from such a system. Such is the indoctrination of these people that they believe that the status quo should remain because it’s simply the way things are. This is something I see all the time – workers will often happily accept the status quo because they don’t think that they have the authority, or the right, to question it. And it happens in other spheres of society, too. How long have people repressed homosexuality for fear that it wasn’t normal – and how many women have stayed at home to look after the kids and do the housework, because “that’s what’s supposed to happen”?\nThe book therefore, has a clear agenda – to promote Socialism. It would be very harsh to call it propaganda, but it is clearly didactic. And to very good effect. Socialism is not a term I’ve always understood. Dictionary definitions are usually too vague, the nature of dictionaries limiting defintions to a few lines. Encyclopaedic sources, even the internet kind without the limit of paper space, are often written academically, to be understood by those with a good knowledge of political or socio-economic jargon. Allegories, such as Animal Farm, can seem a bit too distant from the world of the reader, and so do not really afford any pathos. The explanations given in the book are perfectly understandable, and the setting of the novel around a group of working men, facing situations that even myself, as a white-collar worker, can relate to.\nMore importantly, the arguments for Socialism are convincing.\nIf they do want for anything, it is that the book portrays Socialism in the greatest light possible. It presents a dream of an almost Utopian world, with peace, harmony and utter contentment everywhere. Perhaps I’m cynical, but whatever benefits might arise from Socialism, I doubt that it would lead to a perfect world. A better world, quite possibly, but not perfect. Another problem, though not at all insurmountable, is the difference between the book’s world and the world of today. The two are very different, so perhaps the vision of Socialism presented to us by Tressell might not be fully workable in this day and age, but that’s no reason to simply give it up as a bad job.\nSo where am I politically now? More to the left, certainly. More questioning of the status quo. And undoubtedly more aware of the effects of Capitalism on society – I’m becoming more aware of the Co-operative and Fairtrade movements, and the benefits that such things provide. When you’ve grown up all of your life in a Capitalist society, as I have, it’s often difficult to miss them. I’m glad I can see things from another angle now.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_page_5/content_223.html": "Religion\nThis post has been inspired by a question asked on the Sunderland Green Party forum recently, and I thought it might be worth a blog post, as religion is something that interests me, in terms of how it affects me and society. The question is thus:\nWhat role should religion play…?\n1. In the lives of yourself and others\n2. In politics / public debate and policy\nThe first question: A simple answer is that it probably shouldn’t have to have any role, although even in this day and age, it doubtlessly will, even if by minor degrees. Days of the week, for instance, being named for deities. The England flags ubiquitous during international football tournaments have a Christian cross upon them. Streets, schools and other places are often named for saints or other religious figures. Of course, these are just roses by other names, and probably don’t have any influence on ourselves or society to any great extent.\nThen, of course, there are those aspects of religion that do have a part in our lives, and affect the things we do – even if we’re not religious. We take Good Friday and Easter Monday off work, for instance. In the past we’ve been restricted by Sunday trading laws. And I can confidently predict that later in the year, myself (a Pagan) and my friends Nigel (an atheist) and Charlotte (a Jew) will be sitting around a table in a pub swapping Christmas presents. We also have some very major religious influences. Extremism, terrorism, war – in this way, religion has affected everybody from Holocaust victims to those people prevented from taking liquids onto aeroplanes. In vastly different ways, of course, but religion has been there; if not as a direct cause, then as an excuse. These are roles that religion plays in our lives regardless of whether or not one has a religion. Where a person does subscribe to a faith, however, its influence will be even more profound – though not necessarily on the same level. It really depends upon how a person sees their religion.\nSome will see their religion as a philosophy, or set of philosophies, to explain life, the universe and everything. In this respect, it probably differs only from atheism in the presence of some supreme being or entity. This may be enough to play a serious role in a person’s life. Reverence of nature is part of Druid belief, and subscription to that faith may well encourage somebody to be more kind to nature. But there is also a legislative aspect to many religions. Christianity has many laws, for want of a better word. The best known of these are the Ten Commandments, though the bible, in particular the Old Testament, is full of many others. Many will see it important to keep to such tenets, as a way of keeping faith or attaining some higher station (entering Heaven, for instance). This can be a positive thing if it encourages such things as friendliness and respect, but not so good if it represses natural tendencies, such as alternate sexualities.\nReligious law, however, raises a good question concerning personal freedom. Yes, a person has freedom of religion – but should a person be free to believe in something that prevents them from being themselves (and therefore even more free)? The argument over niqabs is a classic example – is it a woman’s right to subscribe to a religion that compels her to wear one, or is it a woman’s right to bear her face in public regardless?\nHowever, the second question is a little different. I’d agree that people have a right to religion (you can’t stop people believing what they want anyway, metaphysical or otherwise), though I don’t think it has a place in politics. Religion is, after all, a belief, not a proven fact, and it would be highly irresponsible of any government to allow blind faith to affect its decisions. Any metaphysical theory has only a minute chance of ever being correct, and faith itself is very arbitrary. Therefore, laws enacted in the name of faith are arbitrary. In Tudor England, for example, Catholics were executed as heretics when Protestants were in power; when the Catholics ruled, Protestants were executed. Clearly, government cannot be fair if it is based upon the unproven beliefs of whomever might be in power. Such beliefs do not even have to be religious, of course – McCarthyism brought the same sort of issues as the Salem Witch Trials.\nGovernment must work upon what is known. We know that condoms prevent death and disease. We do not know if there is a deity out there who will banish us unto eternal torment for using them. In reality, it’s just as possible (and as improbable) that there is a deity out there ready to grant us eternal paradise for the same thing. If there were proof, of course, that Hell awaited us for such an act, there’d be reason for our government to protect our eternal souls. But unless we have that, we cannot make laws on blind assumptions – religious or not.\nOf course, this isn’t to say that a state’s laws should not make any reference to religion at all. It should still be realised that people have a right to religion, and a right to practise it. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people can do so equally. I’ve long thought it a shame that the Bank Holiday schedule in England is mostly based around Christian festivals (even if they’re only there to suppress Pagan ones). A Muslim might be happy to be given Easter off, if for no other reason than a break from work, but would that same person be happy to be working through Ramadan? (if you’re a Muslim, I’d be interested in your thoughts on that – not being one, I can’t answer it. You get the idea, anyway).\nHaving said this, it often irritates me that religion is often given an untouchable status, whereas other forms of philosophy are not. For example, if an employee refused to work a Sunday to attend church, many employers would submit to that, for fear of being labelled politically incorrect (at best). But I doubt the same would apply to somebody who wished to attend a political event, no matter how fervent their belief. If we recognise religious freedom in the law, we should also recognise other philosophical freedoms.\nSlutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.\nSoldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!\nRetrospection\nSo, farewell then, 2010, as E. J. Thribb might say. The year has been good fun, with mostly plus points. So for those who might be interested, here’s my 2010 summed up,\nJanuary: As per the previous two years, January was pantomime month with the Washington Theatre Group. This year saw me playing the downtrodden Blue Peter in Peter Pan: The Revenge of Hook.\nFebruary: Thought I’d give ballet a try (watching, not doing), in the shape of The Nutcracker, full of music I already thought wonderful. And I’d definitely see some again.\nMarch: A trip to the South coast to see the Tiger Lillies in Brighton with Billie and Jen. I must visit Brighton again one day.\nApril: A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies in a recorded showing of Shockheaded Peter at The V&A. The Lillies also made a trip to Durham, so I could see them without having to travel more than 20 miles.\nMay: Joined the Green Party, shortly after Caroline Lucas became their first MP. Tried vegetarianism for a week.\nJune: ROCKY HORROR! And Nigel actually remembers this one. Will wonders never cease?\nJuly: Welcome to the Jungle with the WTG, playing a couch potato and a doberman (“Strong, naturally dominant, fanatically loyal, and of course, highly intelligent” – just like me, then). One of the plays was also my inaugural attempt at directing. I’ve never been so nervous in the theatre as when that play was first performed.\nAugust: Much hilarity as a scorpion is found at the Arts Centre Washington and the place is closed for two days. Oh, for those halcyon days in Botswana when even a kid getting stung by a scorpion wouldn’t have the school closed for five minutes.\nSeptember: Plenty of theatre this month: Apples, Hairspray, The King & I and Blithe Spirit.\nOctober: Failed a driving test, but passed a stand-up comedy test after doing a turn for the Sunderland Green Party. Hopefully, it won’t be a the last.\nNovember: Performing at the Royalty in Journey’s End – great fun to do, and the moustache will live on in legend.\nDecember: Begun rehearsals of Macbeth at the Royalty, in some small but fun parts.\nBring on 2011.\nUniversity Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.\nStand-up Comedy\nDespite having been part of the glitzy, glamorous Wearside Am-Dram set for a few years now, it’s been only recently that I’ve considered what fun it might be to have a go at stand-up comedy. Not that it should be a logical conclusion for any amateur dramatician, more a logical conclusion for somebody as prone to deploying sarcasm and mockery as I am. But at some time earlier this year, I had a think about it. Yeah, I thought. I could give that a go? Why not?\nWhy not indeed. Probably because I’ve seen it done on numerous occasions, by both seasoned professionals and first-timers, and it’s always seemed quite scary. Granted, maybe not a scary as returning home to find that your house has been infested by flying tarantulas wielding surgical implements, but certainly enough to put so many butterflies in your stomach that you can’t floss without finding stray bits of Lepidoptera between your teeth.\nThe trouble seemed to be twofold: That you have nobody else to rely on but yourself, and if you mess something up, then it’s down purely to your own cunning improvisation skills to paddle your way out of that nefarious creek. Secondly – hecklers. They can be a cruel species, and you need to be able deal swiftly with anything they throw at you, particularly if it’s a bottle of Stella. Again, that’s where improvisation comes into play – not one of my stronger points.\nHowever, six weeks ago, an opportunity to try it came winging its way through cyberspace to me, in the form of an e-mail from the co-ordinator of the Sunderland branch of the Green Party. He asked if I’d be able to arrange a 20-minute comedy piece for the branch’s first birthday party. This could, it transpired, have been more or less anything I’d wished – sketches, stand-up, whatever. So I gave it a few days’ thought and decided I’d do it. A few more days, and I’d decided upon stand-up.\nIt was quite a scary prospect. However, I took comfort from the fact that I’ve been able to do monologues before in theatre, even comic stuff that could get people laughing. Also, being the event it was, there was little prospect of hecklers giving me a hard time (though that Doberman costume did get raised). Furthermore, when I’d first thought about it, I’d already written some material for it.\nSo the groundwork was there, it just needed practice. This was quite fun; I had a policy of not sticking rigidly to the script, but that proved to be a good thing – each rehearsal seemed to bring a new joke/punchline. If there’s one thing I think I’ve learned from this, it’s that you can’t get too much practice – even if it’s in the local park and you look like an idiot waving his arms about and talking to himself.\nAnd on Saturday, the moment of truth arrived. At around 16.55, I took to the stage. I’m glad to say it went pretty much as planned. I didn’t expect people to be dying from laughter, though I also didn’t imagine that I’d be sending any tumbleweed flying through the pub. The laughs came pretty much in the right places, which was gratifying. This is, of course, a problem with stand-up: You can instantly judge what your performance is like because nobody can really be forced into laughing. If you’re in a play, even if you make a production of Hamlet look like Battlefield Earth, people will clap at the end. Which is always nice. But if you do bad stand-up and nobody laughs, that’s immediately telling.\nThankfully, that didn’t happen to me. But I’ve managed to do it, and whilst Izzard and co won’t be fearing for their jobs anytime soon, I’ll definitely give it a go again if I get the chance. He who dares, Rodders, he who dares…\nVoices\nBeen a while since I posted. Time for a poem, I think.\nVoices\nI have some voices in my head\nThat tell me what to do.\nTheir names are Jub, and Flib, and Xed,\nThere’s Grimp and Weeble, too.\nOne day the voices said to me,\n“Hey Johnny, listen close,\nYou have to make a cup of tea,\nAnd then some buttered toast”.\nSo off I went to make my drink,\nObedient and dumb,\nI never even stopped to think\nWhat harm to me might come.\nBut ‘cos the tea had been so nice,\nThe voices gained my trust.\nEach day I’d hear from them twice,\nDid what they said I must.\nBut then one fateful day, they said,\n“Hey Johnny, listen here:\nYou must shoot someone in the head,\nAnd we’ll give you some beer.”\nI found a gun with perfect ease.\nAnd then a victim, too.\nI gave the trigger such a squeeze\nIt turned my fingers blue.\nThe fellow’s brains went everywhere,\nThe room was red as hell.\nThe took me into special care –\nA private padded cell.\nNow you might ask me if I rue\nThe mess that got me here.\nAnd I would say, “Of course I do –\nI never got the beer!”\n© John Appleton 2010\nNational Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.\nThe 2010 General Election\nIt feels like there’s something important about tomorrow’s General Election. Perhaps it’s simply because over the past year or so, I’ve been more acutely aware of politics in Britain, and indeed the world. Not just from a point of view of Westminster/Capitol Hill, but also from a point of view of the grass roots of society, and how they’re treated by the higher classes. Perhaps it’s because there have been some major events that transcended the purely political and the ordinary – The economic crisis is seen on the streets, it’s talked of in Whitehall as a major issue. Barrack Obama’s healthcare reforms have divided America, from the unemployed to the whatever the US might consider their aristocracy. Perhaps, it’s just because we look like we’re in for a change of government, and for the first time I can remember, it’s not just a two-horse race. The Liberal Democrats appear to have got a foot in the door, and from a Northeast perspective, I’m seeing the Greens field more candidates than I can recall in a previous election.\nMy personal politics have swung sharply to the left over the last year – see the earlier post on The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists for at least one reason. The book was an eye-opener for me, not just to left-wing politics, but also, indirectly, to other spheres of alternative culture – social justice and sustainability, to name a couple. The Greens, therefore, should be the party for whom I’m voting. Alas, the good old First-Past-The-Post system ensures that I, and doubtless many other Northeasterners who aren’t lucky enough to live on Tyneside, cannot show the support to this party that I’d wish. It’s at least thankful that I do have this option in the local elections, also taking place tomorrow.\nSo to whom will I be giving my support?\nThe Conservative Party have appeared, over this campaign, to be the antithesis of what I believe in. David Cameron rarely appears to be genuine; merely a person who knows what to say, but only when it’s scripted and he’s been able to prepare. In thinking on his feet, he has faltered. He might have some talent for rhetoric, scrub up well, and look the part – but there’s a word for that – Acting. Sure, he’s good at it, but that’s not the mark of a statesperson. More to the point, I’m not a capitalist. “Traditional values” are not something that I prize for the sake of tradition. I care not for fox-hunting; I don’t want its ban repealed. I care not for marriage, and the Conservative plans to put marriage on a pedestal in the tax system are unfair to both those who don’t wish to be married, and to those who find relationships difficult to obtain or sustain. The terrible truth is that such people are left to feel bad about themselves when marriage is promoted as the good, proper thing to do.\nFurthermore, the nature of the Conservatives’ attitude to sexual freedom has been widely criticised over the campaign, not least because of this person, which was only one of many stories in the press showing Conservatives, some very senior, to be fairly homophobic. I can only hope this hasn’t gone unnoticed by too many.\nThe Labour Party have had thirteen years to change the country, after promising the same for four General Elections. It wasn’t a surprise that they won in 1997 – a whole generation of voters had grown up under Conservative rule, which became increasingly unpopular, and the relatively young, energetic persona of Tony Blair was always going to defeat the grey-faced, dull image of John Major, whatever you may have thought of either. But the Blairite (or perhaps Blair-Right) politics of New Labour looked distinctly Conservative, so no major change occurred. But this had been on the cards, some might have felt, after the removal of Clause IV from Labour’s constitution, which saw the party move from being one with explicit socialist aims, to one paying mere lip-service to the working classes. Thirteen years with no change. Or perhaps that’s not true. In 1997 the economy was relatively stable, and we weren’t in any deeply unpopular wars. Change, indeed. So, no vote for Labour either.\nAny party with nationalist agendas (UKIP, the BNP, the National Front, and the English Democrats) will never get my vote. I know well the value of a multicultural society. Those who impugn it are simply, in my opinion, ignorant.\nSo, it’s the Liberal Democrats. Something of a protest vote, something of a tactical vote, something of a belief that the two main parties are resembling the pigs and farmers at the end of Animal Farm, and something does need to change. It maybe that a Liberal government would end up not offering such; in fact, if the television debates have changed my mind about anything, it’s that Nick Clegg appears as scripted as the other two leaders. But without the Green option, it appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament, and all that really changes is the voting system, as some commentators have speculated.\nBut in spirit, I’ll be backing the Green Party.\nRetrospection\nMore an excuse to make a post than anything else, really. A quick review of the fun stuff this year.\nJanuary: Snow White and the Magic Mirror with the Washington Theatre Group. I still think I owe some revenge upon who thought up the final night trick they played on me.\nFebruary: Not fun. Moving swiftly on…\nMarch: The renewal of an old acquaintance that would have an effect on my thoughts on politics, my confidence, and led to a greater appreciation of poetry and music from a participative perspective. Say that twenty times fast.\nApril: Three birthday parties.\nMay: London, Manchester, Sunderland, London and Harrogate were where I spent Saturday nights – Enjoying the Tiger Lillies, Rebecca Newman, The Fab Café and Breathing Corpses at the Royalty.\nJune: Playing four parts in The Graduate at the Royalty.\nJuly: Visits to the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery.\nAugust: Hanging around South London for a change. And a first full weekend at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nSeptember: Manchester weekend of pink and blackness.\nOctober: Grized Ale, a lovely Lake District beer. A weekend in the Lake District, with no lakes. But that didn’t spoil it. And, a paid acting job. Thirty whole quid.\nNovember: The month of the housewarming party, of which there were two. And I had to go and resort to gin, didn’t I?\nDecember: First niece, Eloise Jennifer, born. A fifth London trip, and one to York. And, I think, a first completion of an Araucaria crossword.\nGood year, all told.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_beer/content_140.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_europe/content_100.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_cynicism/content_122.html": "Night of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nEuro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nGull Lover’s Travails.\nI have nothing against animal rights, nor indeed against those who wish to be nice to all things great and small. Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening. I’m hoping this won’t be the case.",

Worth the trip.\nApril: Performed in Proof at The Royalty, playing a Mathematician with mental issues. Worth seeing the film if you can.\nMay: Trip to Manchester for poetry, art and theatre. And real ale and and Hats. That’s like a holy pentanity, or something.\nJune: In the tech box for once, running lights for Deathtrap with Washington Theatre Group.\nJuly: A camping and swimming trip, around the Northumbrian Coast. Swam at Low Newton and Sugar Sands, freezing cold but worth every penny of the wetsuit. Became vice-chair of the Royalty Theatre.\nAugust: A break in the Lake District, firstly staying in Keswick and seeing some of the finest theatre I’ve ever witnessed, at the Theatre by the Lake. This was followed by some camping in Grizedale, now becoming a favourite camping haunt. And some swims in Grasmere and Rydal water, on warm sunny days in beautiful surroundings. Played the Caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland with Washington Theatre Group.\nSeptember: Another North-East Skinny Dip, preceded by an evening swim around the Farne Islands surrounded by seals. Easily the best experience of the year. Also, a trip to Brighton.\nOctober: Playing Lennie in Of Mice and Men at The Royalty; easily the biggest acting challenge I’ve ever had. Still surprised that I got through it.\nNovember: Finish playing Lennie. Suprised I got through it.\nDecember: Crosswords turn 100.

Despite this, a memorable trip if only for that wonderful game pie at the Eagle’s Head – the highlight of the 13-hour holiday. Performed this poem at the launch event for the Middlesbrough Literary Festival.\nJuly: A second camping trip, this time around the Northumbrian Coast, proved more successful. Great weather all over the place, and the fish and chips from Beadnell Bay are highly recommended.\nAugust: Took part in an anti-NF demo in Sunderland. The star of the NF show was the guy in the Chelsea shirt with “Essien” on the back. Michael Essien, a black foreigner, an immigrant with a job.

Scary experience, and an ironic one – I’m the smartarse who always knows his lines first, and I had to do the entire performance with a script.\nNovember: Started archery lessons with Whitburn Archers.\nDecember: Directing The Day after the Fair. Coming to a theatre near you soon. If you’re near The Royalty.\nRoll on 2013.\nRetrospection\nIt’s been a hell of a year, if I’m honest. There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nRetrospection\nSo, farewell then, 2010, as E. J. Thribb might say. The year has been good fun, with mostly plus points. So for those who might be interested, here’s my 2010 summed up,\nJanuary: As per the previous two years, January was pantomime month with the Washington Theatre Group. This year saw me playing the downtrodden Blue Peter in Peter Pan: The Revenge of Hook.\nFebruary: Thought I’d give ballet a try (watching, not doing), in the shape of The Nutcracker, full of music I already thought wonderful. And I’d definitely see some again.\nMarch: A trip to the South coast to see the Tiger Lillies in Brighton with Billie and Jen. I must visit Brighton again one day.\nApril: A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies in a recorded showing of Shockheaded Peter at The V&A. The Lillies also made a trip to Durham, so I could see them without having to travel more than 20 miles.\nMay: Joined the Green Party, shortly after Caroline Lucas became their first MP. Tried vegetarianism for a week.\nJune: ROCKY HORROR! And Nigel actually remembers this one. Will wonders never cease?\nJuly: Welcome to the Jungle with the WTG, playing a couch potato and a doberman (“Strong, naturally dominant, fanatically loyal, and of course, highly intelligent” – just like me, then). One of the plays was also my inaugural attempt at directing. I’ve never been so nervous in the theatre as when that play was first performed.\nAugust: Much hilarity as a scorpion is found at the Arts Centre Washington and the place is closed for two days. Oh, for those halcyon days in Botswana when even a kid getting stung by a scorpion wouldn’t have the school closed for five minutes.\nSeptember: Plenty of theatre this month: Apples, Hairspray, The King & I and Blithe Spirit.\nOctober: Failed a driving test, but passed a stand-up comedy test after doing a turn for the Sunderland Green Party. Hopefully, it won’t be a the last.\nNovember: Performing at the Royalty in Journey’s End – great fun to do, and the moustache will live on in legend.\nDecember: Begun rehearsals of Macbeth at the Royalty, in some small but fun parts.\nBring on 2011.\nRetrospection\nMore an excuse to make a post than anything else, really. A quick review of the fun stuff this year.\nJanuary: Snow White and the Magic Mirror with the Washington Theatre Group. I still think I owe some revenge upon who thought up the final night trick they played on me.\nFebruary: Not fun. Moving swiftly on…\nMarch: The renewal of an old acquaintance that would have an effect on my thoughts on politics, my confidence, and led to a greater appreciation of poetry and music from a participative perspective. Say that twenty times fast.\nApril: Three birthday parties.\nMay: London, Manchester, Sunderland, London and Harrogate were where I spent Saturday nights – Enjoying the Tiger Lillies, Rebecca Newman, The Fab Café and Breathing Corpses at the Royalty.\nJune: Playing four parts in The Graduate at the Royalty.\nJuly: Visits to the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery.\nAugust: Hanging around South London for a change. And a first full weekend at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nSeptember: Manchester weekend of pink and blackness.\nOctober: Grized Ale, a lovely Lake District beer. A weekend in the Lake District, with no lakes. But that didn’t spoil it. And, a paid acting job. Thirty whole quid.\nNovember: The month of the housewarming party, of which there were two. And I had to go and resort to gin, didn’t I?\nDecember: First niece, Eloise Jennifer, born. A fifth London trip, and one to York. And, I think, a first completion of an Araucaria crossword.\nGood year, all told.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_social-justice/content_42.html": "Boardroom Quotas\nNovember 17, 2015 at 4:11 pm (Politics) (Baseball, Politics, Racism, Sexism, Social Justice, Sport)\nThe idea of boardroom quotas, or any kind of employment quotas for women, will probably always be contentious. Accusations of “positive discrimination” will fly around, even from progressive people. I can understand both sides of this argument.\nBut let’s look at the idea of quotas from another angle.\nBack in the 1940s, Major League Baseball in the US had an unofficial colour bar. There was nothing in the laws of the sport to prevent a Major League team from playing a black man, but it was something that just didn’t happen. There were many black players, but these men had to content themsleves with playing in the Negro leagues.\nHowever, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, knew that there was a vast amount of talent in the Negro leagues, and thought it foolish that he couldn’t use their talent due to an unwritten rule of the sport. So he decided that he would sign a single black player, to prove that their inclusion could benefit the game, rather than spoil it.\nThe player he chose was Jackie Robinson. On April 15th 1947, Robinson made his Major League debut. The debut was not a remarkable one (regarding his performance at least), but over the summer he grew to be a hit with fans and media. Other clubs took notice. Slowly, the colour bar crumbled and fell. Today, April 15th is celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day, his shirt number (42) is the only one retired from all MLB teams, and to look at any Major League team, no-one would imagine that there was ever an issue with racial inclusion in the sport.\nBranch Rickey had essentially given himself a quota. One might say this was positive discrimination, that a white man might have lost his place in the team due to tokenism. One might also argue that Jackie Robinson might have been as good, or better than that white man, and was therefore deserving of his place. But this is a major point in my argument – it was important for Rickey to find a black player who would be a success and who could honestly say that he’d earned the right to be part of the team. Had he chosen just any black player for the sake of inclusion, that player might have proved a bad choice – which would have set the whole issue far back.\nThe issue of female quotas bears little difference to this – if a woman’s skills prove that she is good enough, a quota should not be an issue. It may indeed prevent a man from getting the same job because of his gender – but what’s often forgotten is that to redress any inequality, one must take an action that is itself unequal. Looking at it mathematically, if we have two numbers, 3 and 5, which we want to make equal, we must do something to one number that we don’t do to the other.\nThis is why we have International Women’s Day but don’t really bother with the male equivalent. It’s why we have an LGBT rights movement and not a straight/cis rights movement. Use the term “positive discrimination” all you like, but take a moment to remember what “positive” means. It’s not necessarily a bad thing.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_06_23_artistic-justification/content_218.html": "Artistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.\nHave your say!",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_10_31_out-of-date/content_181.html": "Out of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_06_30_religion/content_155.html": "Religion\nThis post has been inspired by a question asked on the Sunderland Green Party forum recently, and I thought it might be worth a blog post, as religion is something that interests me, in terms of how it affects me and society. The question is thus:\nWhat role should religion play…?\n1. In the lives of yourself and others\n2. In politics / public debate and policy\nThe first question: A simple answer is that it probably shouldn’t have to have any role, although even in this day and age, it doubtlessly will, even if by minor degrees. Days of the week, for instance, being named for deities. The England flags ubiquitous during international football tournaments have a Christian cross upon them. Streets, schools and other places are often named for saints or other religious figures. Of course, these are just roses by other names, and probably don’t have any influence on ourselves or society to any great extent.\nThen, of course, there are those aspects of religion that do have a part in our lives, and affect the things we do – even if we’re not religious. We take Good Friday and Easter Monday off work, for instance. In the past we’ve been restricted by Sunday trading laws. And I can confidently predict that later in the year, myself (a Pagan) and my friends Nigel (an atheist) and Charlotte (a Jew) will be sitting around a table in a pub swapping Christmas presents. We also have some very major religious influences. Extremism, terrorism, war – in this way, religion has affected everybody from Holocaust victims to those people prevented from taking liquids onto aeroplanes. In vastly different ways, of course, but religion has been there; if not as a direct cause, then as an excuse. These are roles that religion plays in our lives regardless of whether or not one has a religion. Where a person does subscribe to a faith, however, its influence will be even more profound – though not necessarily on the same level. It really depends upon how a person sees their religion.\nSome will see their religion as a philosophy, or set of philosophies, to explain life, the universe and everything. In this respect, it probably differs only from atheism in the presence of some supreme being or entity. This may be enough to play a serious role in a person’s life. Reverence of nature is part of Druid belief, and subscription to that faith may well encourage somebody to be more kind to nature. But there is also a legislative aspect to many religions. Christianity has many laws, for want of a better word. The best known of these are the Ten Commandments, though the bible, in particular the Old Testament, is full of many others. Many will see it important to keep to such tenets, as a way of keeping faith or attaining some higher station (entering Heaven, for instance). This can be a positive thing if it encourages such things as friendliness and respect, but not so good if it represses natural tendencies, such as alternate sexualities.\nReligious law, however, raises a good question concerning personal freedom. Yes, a person has freedom of religion – but should a person be free to believe in something that prevents them from being themselves (and therefore even more free)? The argument over niqabs is a classic example – is it a woman’s right to subscribe to a religion that compels her to wear one, or is it a woman’s right to bear her face in public regardless?\nHowever, the second question is a little different. I’d agree that people have a right to religion (you can’t stop people believing what they want anyway, metaphysical or otherwise), though I don’t think it has a place in politics. Religion is, after all, a belief, not a proven fact, and it would be highly irresponsible of any government to allow blind faith to affect its decisions. Any metaphysical theory has only a minute chance of ever being correct, and faith itself is very arbitrary. Therefore, laws enacted in the name of faith are arbitrary. In Tudor England, for example, Catholics were executed as heretics when Protestants were in power; when the Catholics ruled, Protestants were executed. Clearly, government cannot be fair if it is based upon the unproven beliefs of whomever might be in power. Such beliefs do not even have to be religious, of course – McCarthyism brought the same sort of issues as the Salem Witch Trials.\nGovernment must work upon what is known. We know that condoms prevent death and disease. We do not know if there is a deity out there who will banish us unto eternal torment for using them. In reality, it’s just as possible (and as improbable) that there is a deity out there ready to grant us eternal paradise for the same thing. If there were proof, of course, that Hell awaited us for such an act, there’d be reason for our government to protect our eternal souls. But unless we have that, we cannot make laws on blind assumptions – religious or not.\nOf course, this isn’t to say that a state’s laws should not make any reference to religion at all. It should still be realised that people have a right to religion, and a right to practise it. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people can do so equally. I’ve long thought it a shame that the Bank Holiday schedule in England is mostly based around Christian festivals (even if they’re only there to suppress Pagan ones). A Muslim might be happy to be given Easter off, if for no other reason than a break from work, but would that same person be happy to be working through Ramadan? (if you’re a Muslim, I’d be interested in your thoughts on that – not being one, I can’t answer it. You get the idea, anyway).\nHaving said this, it often irritates me that religion is often given an untouchable status, whereas other forms of philosophy are not. For example, if an employee refused to work a Sunday to attend church, many employers would submit to that, for fear of being labelled politically incorrect (at best). But I doubt the same would apply to somebody who wished to attend a political event, no matter how fervent their belief. If we recognise religious freedom in the law, we should also recognise other philosophical freedoms.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_politics_page_2/content_220.html": "Deaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nLas Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?\nPoppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.\nSlutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.\nUniversity Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.\nThe 2010 General Election\nIt feels like there’s something important about tomorrow’s General Election. Perhaps it’s simply because over the past year or so, I’ve been more acutely aware of politics in Britain, and indeed the world. Not just from a point of view of Westminster/Capitol Hill, but also from a point of view of the grass roots of society, and how they’re treated by the higher classes. Perhaps it’s because there have been some major events that transcended the purely political and the ordinary – The economic crisis is seen on the streets, it’s talked of in Whitehall as a major issue. Barrack Obama’s healthcare reforms have divided America, from the unemployed to the whatever the US might consider their aristocracy. Perhaps, it’s just because we look like we’re in for a change of government, and for the first time I can remember, it’s not just a two-horse race. The Liberal Democrats appear to have got a foot in the door, and from a Northeast perspective, I’m seeing the Greens field more candidates than I can recall in a previous election.\nMy personal politics have swung sharply to the left over the last year – see the earlier post on The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists for at least one reason. The book was an eye-opener for me, not just to left-wing politics, but also, indirectly, to other spheres of alternative culture – social justice and sustainability, to name a couple. The Greens, therefore, should be the party for whom I’m voting. Alas, the good old First-Past-The-Post system ensures that I, and doubtless many other Northeasterners who aren’t lucky enough to live on Tyneside, cannot show the support to this party that I’d wish. It’s at least thankful that I do have this option in the local elections, also taking place tomorrow.\nSo to whom will I be giving my support?\nThe Conservative Party have appeared, over this campaign, to be the antithesis of what I believe in. David Cameron rarely appears to be genuine; merely a person who knows what to say, but only when it’s scripted and he’s been able to prepare. In thinking on his feet, he has faltered. He might have some talent for rhetoric, scrub up well, and look the part – but there’s a word for that – Acting. Sure, he’s good at it, but that’s not the mark of a statesperson. More to the point, I’m not a capitalist. “Traditional values” are not something that I prize for the sake of tradition. I care not for fox-hunting; I don’t want its ban repealed. I care not for marriage, and the Conservative plans to put marriage on a pedestal in the tax system are unfair to both those who don’t wish to be married, and to those who find relationships difficult to obtain or sustain. The terrible truth is that such people are left to feel bad about themselves when marriage is promoted as the good, proper thing to do.\nFurthermore, the nature of the Conservatives’ attitude to sexual freedom has been widely criticised over the campaign, not least because of this person, which was only one of many stories in the press showing Conservatives, some very senior, to be fairly homophobic. I can only hope this hasn’t gone unnoticed by too many.\nThe Labour Party have had thirteen years to change the country, after promising the same for four General Elections. It wasn’t a surprise that they won in 1997 – a whole generation of voters had grown up under Conservative rule, which became increasingly unpopular, and the relatively young, energetic persona of Tony Blair was always going to defeat the grey-faced, dull image of John Major, whatever you may have thought of either. But the Blairite (or perhaps Blair-Right) politics of New Labour looked distinctly Conservative, so no major change occurred. But this had been on the cards, some might have felt, after the removal of Clause IV from Labour’s constitution, which saw the party move from being one with explicit socialist aims, to one paying mere lip-service to the working classes. Thirteen years with no change. Or perhaps that’s not true. In 1997 the economy was relatively stable, and we weren’t in any deeply unpopular wars. Change, indeed. So, no vote for Labour either.\nAny party with nationalist agendas (UKIP, the BNP, the National Front, and the English Democrats) will never get my vote. I know well the value of a multicultural society. Those who impugn it are simply, in my opinion, ignorant.\nSo, it’s the Liberal Democrats. Something of a protest vote, something of a tactical vote, something of a belief that the two main parties are resembling the pigs and farmers at the end of Animal Farm, and something does need to change. It maybe that a Liberal government would end up not offering such; in fact, if the television debates have changed my mind about anything, it’s that Nick Clegg appears as scripted as the other two leaders. But without the Green option, it appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament, and all that really changes is the voting system, as some commentators have speculated.\nBut in spirit, I’ll be backing the Green Party.\nFree Speech\nFree Speech – a lovely phrase. A democratic ideal, but perhaps unconsciously to many, one of those concepts that can all too often trigger an “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” response. Whilst many people will state that they agree with the idea of Free Speech, some of these will nonetheless call for the censorship of extreme views with which they do not approve. Two recent media events have been examples of Free Speech being used as a platform for views with which I certainly do not agree. This, of course, challenged me to consider my opinions on Free Speech.\nThe first of these incidents was Jan Moir’s repugnant Daily Mail article about the nature (or “unnature”, as she might have it), surrounding the death of Stephen Gately. This article, despite the fact that neither police nor coroner have ever suggested anything other than a death from natural causes, blamed his death on his homosexuality. Not in so many words, obviously – but the suggestion was plastered over the article. A massive internet backlash, lead by (among others) Derren Brown, Stephen Fry and a wonderfully scathing article by Charlie Brooker lead to a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission, and withdrawal of advertisments from the Daily Mail‘s website.\nThe second event was Nick Griffin’s appearance on Question Time. The BBC’s decision was criticised by many who considered that it would give the BNP more of a standing as a political party. I do wonder how many of such people would otherwise have defended free speech. In the event, Nick Griffin simply ended up making himself look like the uneducated bigot that many consider him to be – in showing a blatant ignorance of basic history and culture.\nBoth Nick Griffin and Jan Moir have expressed, on a vast public stage, opinions that to me are utterly despicable. But should they still be allowed to make these opinions public?\nHell yes.\nNick Griffin made himself look a fool. Jan Moir may have made a name for herself (I hadn’t previously heard of her), but it’s muddier than a Mississippi Mud Pie that’s fallen in Mud. I’m not sure who stated that “It’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt”, but I think that if we let the fools speak, it’s easier for us to recognise who they are. Intellectual evolution, really.\nThe English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.",

Intellectual evolution, really.\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nThe Zombie King\nI’m quite liking the sestina verse form – the same six words (or syllables) are used, in a specific pattern, to end the lines of each stanza, and also have a specific placing in the envoi. It’s like poetic sudoku. Here’s a vague attempt…\nThe Zombie King\nIt was a dark and stormy night,\nAnd shuffling in his earthy grave,\nThe figure of the Zombie King\nWas baying for a feast of blood.\nThe Grand High Priest of all the dead\nWould soon arise to seek his prey.\n‘Twas weeks since last he’d taken prey;\nAt last, a storm had come that night.\nThe wet ground stirred the Evil Dead,\nand made them restless in the grave.\nAnd one was hungry for some blood:\nIt was, of course, the Zombie King.\nAnd on the prowl, the Zombie King\nAt last had spotted tasty prey.\nA pure soul, whose virgin blood\nWould be a feast to make his night.\nThe girl stood by her father’s grave,\nAnd cried, and wished he wasn’t dead.\nBut now the Lord of all Undead,\nThe evil, mindless Zombie King,\nCrept silently toward the grave,\nWith eyes set firmly on his prey.\nIt was to be her final night;\nHe licked his lips: at last, some blood!\nHe pounced on her, it chilled her blood.\nHer screams amused the living dead,\nWhose laughter echoed through the night.\nAnd while she lay there, panicking,\nShe had one choice: to hope and pray\nShe wouldn’t die on Daddy’s grave.\nHe pinned his victim to the grave,\nWith yellow fangs he drew her blood.\nA tasty meal, his virgin prey,\nAnd soon the hapless girl was dead.\nA triumph for the Zombie King,\nUpon that dark and stormy night.\nBack in the grave, the Evil Dead\nWere drunk on blood, and hailed their King,\nAnd prayed for more another night.\n© John Appleton 2009\nGull Lover’s Travails.\nI have nothing against animal rights, nor indeed against those who wish to be nice to all things great and small. Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening. I’m hoping this won’t be the case.\nArtistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.\nThe English Democrats – Freedom Fail\nA month or so ago, well before the recent European elections, a friend drew my attention to this new party. This friend of mine is relatively open-minded and fairly sensible, and a Party Political Broadcast of theirs had attracted her interest. For what reason, I cannot remember. I resolved, however, to look into them.\nWhen I got around to this, I took a look at their website. Even before that, I became worried about their agenda. Google’s facility to suggest searches based upon what you’ve already typed was returning numerous references to such things as the BNP and racism.\nTheir website’s homepage itself was enough to make me decide that they are not a party with whom I’d wish to bother. Put simply, they appear to be nationalists hiding behind tactile nice-sounding policies, such as the creation of an English Parliament. I may rant about that concept another time, but for now it would be mere digression.The phrase of theirs that really attracted my attention (and I’m copying and pasting this from the site directly) was, “We want English freedoms and values, not multiculturalism.”\nI have three major issues with this. Firstly, whoever picked such rhetoric clearly has no finger on the pulse of history. Since 44BCE, England has been invaded by pretty much any civilisation that could make boats. People from each such civilisation will have stayed around and bred with the indigenous population (which by the time of the Norman Conquest probably wasn’t purely indigenous). Our language, nominally Germanic, has vast influences from Gaelic, Scandinavian and Latin languages. For crying out loud, our country is named after a Germanic people. It is impossible to be English without being multicultural.\nSecondly, who decides what English freedoms and values are? Do these people refer to stiff-upper-lip, no-sex-please, big-red-buses stereotypes as our freedoms and values? If we are to live by stereotypes, we are not free. Freedom, surely, encapsulates the right to choose one’s own culture, and not be bound by prescribed roles.\nFinally, surely an anti-multiculturalist stance is always going to hint to racism. More than that, to homophobia, misogyny and sectarianism. It certainly doesn’t hint at a tolerant regime.\nDespite this, they have still managed to convince some people that they aren’t racist. However, their true colours appear to have been shown recently, in their attitude to Doncaster Pride. The party’s Peter Davies had the following to say: “I don’t think councils should be spending money on them parading through town advertising their sexuality.” I disagree very strongly with this. It is events such as Doncaster Pride that helps to make people aware that LGBT culture is not something that happens to other people, something that you only read about, something scandalous and low. It’s a part of life, and has been a lot longer than a great many aspects of our culture. It’s certainly been around a lot longer than “English freedoms and values”, whatever those may be. For Doncaster Council to spend money on this is a fine thing and should serve as an example to other councils.\nTheir nationalist agenda has too been aired. For instance, they’ve stated that they wish to cut funding for translation services for non-English speakers in Doncaster. Personally, I hope on his next foreign trip, Peter Davies is only ever dealt with by people who cannot speak English, but that of the country they’re in. I bet even getting directions to the beach or looking for the pen of his aunt would cause him problems.\nTo my mind, the English Democrats have no belief in freedom, English or not. They simply want the country to act the way they prescribe, and cut off from the rest of the world and all it has to offer. Well, that’s my vote they’re not getting.\nLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate…\nRight, just a random post to establish some sort of presence. There will be something with actual substance posted later.\nBy way of an explanation, the title here is apparently from the original Italian of Dante’s Divine Comedy. “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” Possibly more portentous than need be, but they can both be recited in iambic pentameter if you try hard enough.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_labour/content_83.html": "The 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_computing/content_171.html": "Alan Turing’s Centenary\nHe might have been 100 this coming weekend. You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_10_14_the-ragged-trousered-philanthropists/content_17.html": "The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists\nOctober 14, 2009 at 9:47 pm (Politics) (Books, Politics, Socialism)\n“If this doesn’t turn you into a raving Socialist,” she said, “Nothing will.” My friend was handing me a copy of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, by Irish workingman Robert Tressell. Preferring to keep an open mind on this grand claim, I took to reading it. At this point it might be prudent to describe my political leanings at the time I began reading. Swinging both ways, really – of the opinion that neither Capitalism nor Socialism held all of the answers.\nFor those unfamiliar with the book, it depicts the lives of a group of workers for a painting and decorating firm in the South of England, in the very early 20th century. We see the conditions under which the men have to work, often oppressed by their profit-minded masters – forced to work as shoddily and cheaply as possible to maximise profits. We see the men’s home lives, and how their poverty affects their wives, parents and children – very little to eat, or indeed to wear. We see the opposite side, the corrupt, yet affluent, lives of the masters – affected Christianity and corrupt control of the means of production and of council business.\nThe book itself is an engaging enough novel, with its occasional comedy and tragedy. But its intent is certainly to be more than entertaining. Throughout the book we are treated to the vision of Owen, one of the labourers, trying to convert his fellow workers to Socialist ideals. The workers themselves, by and large, dismiss these ideas, despite the obvious benefits they’d reap from such a system. Such is the indoctrination of these people that they believe that the status quo should remain because it’s simply the way things are. This is something I see all the time – workers will often happily accept the status quo because they don’t think that they have the authority, or the right, to question it. And it happens in other spheres of society, too. How long have people repressed homosexuality for fear that it wasn’t normal – and how many women have stayed at home to look after the kids and do the housework, because “that’s what’s supposed to happen”?\nThe book therefore, has a clear agenda – to promote Socialism. It would be very harsh to call it propaganda, but it is clearly didactic. And to very good effect. Socialism is not a term I’ve always understood. Dictionary definitions are usually too vague, the nature of dictionaries limiting defintions to a few lines. Encyclopaedic sources, even the internet kind without the limit of paper space, are often written academically, to be understood by those with a good knowledge of political or socio-economic jargon. Allegories, such as Animal Farm, can seem a bit too distant from the world of the reader, and so do not really afford any pathos. The explanations given in the book are perfectly understandable, and the setting of the novel around a group of working men, facing situations that even myself, as a white-collar worker, can relate to.\nMore importantly, the arguments for Socialism are convincing.\nIf they do want for anything, it is that the book portrays Socialism in the greatest light possible. It presents a dream of an almost Utopian world, with peace, harmony and utter contentment everywhere. Perhaps I’m cynical, but whatever benefits might arise from Socialism, I doubt that it would lead to a perfect world. A better world, quite possibly, but not perfect. Another problem, though not at all insurmountable, is the difference between the book’s world and the world of today. The two are very different, so perhaps the vision of Socialism presented to us by Tressell might not be fully workable in this day and age, but that’s no reason to simply give it up as a bad job.\nSo where am I politically now? More to the left, certainly. More questioning of the status quo. And undoubtedly more aware of the effects of Capitalism on society – I’m becoming more aware of the Co-operative and Fairtrade movements, and the benefits that such things provide. When you’ve grown up all of your life in a Capitalist society, as I have, it’s often difficult to miss them. I’m glad I can see things from another angle now.\nJennieB said,\nNovember 9, 2009 at 2:28 pm\nI’m so, so glad that you enjoyed this book; it was certainly a political eye-opener for me (and I am of an anarchic bent when it comes to politics).\nI think the one thing in the book that doesn’t really get highlighted – and I have these discussion with people who call themselves socialists today – is what happens after we’ve gained this socialist utopia? Tressell would be spinning in his grave to see what the original Trade Union strong Labour party has become (it’s argued that the party was set up with this book as an influencial, central tome).\nAs for possibilities for society: there’s lots of recent thinking (again mostly academic) on social ‘movements’, rather than a fixed formula for societal contextualisation (there’s some good stuff on the Autonomous Geographies website about some of the projects: http://www.autonomousgeographies.org).\nAnd I agree with you about not ‘giving it up as a bad job’. In my opinion, there’s no reason to give up on wanting to create a more equitable society that has principles not based on wealth, but on creating happiness and community cohesion; a society that has human, animal, and nature rights at its heart.\noddbodd13 said,\nNovember 23, 2009 at 10:28 pm\nYou’re quite right to question what happens afterwards. So many revolutions are just that – they go full circle, with the victors becoming as bad as the original oppressors. It’s not just something we see in Animal Farm. Look at Cromwell – Within four years of defeating the royalists, he was sole ruler of England, dissolving Parliament at will, as Charles I had done so often.\nOf course, since it’s England, that wasn’t revolution. Civil War, obviously.

We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_05_12_desert-island-books/content_35.html": "Desert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.\nDesert Island Albums « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 20, 2012 at 3:41 pm\n[…] I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The […]",

Still, a lot of good stuff to look back upon.\nJanuary: Back to panto action, with the Washington Theatre Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.\nFebruary: Trip to Liverpool for the Green Party conference and some tourism.\nMarch: About forty different birthday booze-ups for Nigel’s 40th. Seemed like that anyway.\nApril: Performed in a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker. Took a trip into Darkest Yorkshire, too – somehow returning with a lot of beer.\nMay: Trip to London for a birthday. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that cake. I think I winced when the knife went in. Any man would. That should give you an idea of what shape it was.\nJune: Attempted a weekend break in Grizedale, but rain contrived to have half the campsite flooded. Despite this, a memorable trip if only for that wonderful game pie at the Eagle’s Head – the highlight of the 13-hour holiday. Performed this poem at the launch event for the Middlesbrough Literary Festival.\nJuly: A second camping trip, this time around the Northumbrian Coast, proved more successful. Great weather all over the place, and the fish and chips from Beadnell Bay are highly recommended.\nAugust: Took part in an anti-NF demo in Sunderland. The star of the NF show was the guy in the Chelsea shirt with “Essien” on the back. Michael Essien, a black foreigner, an immigrant with a job.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04/content_22.html": "Apples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nDeaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nLas Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_06_02_slutwalks-your-thoughts-please/content_240.html": "Slutwalks…your thoughts, please.\nOver the past couple of months, protest marches dubbed “Slutwalks” have begun to occur in numerous places around the world. I have some concerns about these protests, which I shall explain shortly, but the purpose of this post is to invite opinions that I may not have considered. This is a feminist issue, and I fully realise that, being in possession of a Y-chromosome, there may be something that I’m missing. If so, I want to know what it is.\nFor some background on this, the movement began as a response to a remark from a Candian policeman that “women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised”, as well as similar sentiments from a Canadian Judge (Wikipedia gives greater detail on these incidents).\nNonsensical remarks, of course. Any person, man or woman, has the right to dress to be presentable, smart, attractive or even sexy. This might be for personal confidence, it may be to attract somebody, but it certainly isn’t to elicit attacks. If so, it’d be much easier to stick on a Sunderland shirt and run around the Bigg Market loudly questioning Alan Shearer’s parentage.\nAs a result of the remarks, the Slutwalks began. These involve many women (even though this may not have been the original idea) marching in scantily-clad outfits. The point of this is to show that women have a right to dress this way if they wish, without fear of being victimised. I don’t question the intent of the marches, nor the nobility of the message the marchers are trying to give. What concerns me is the efficacy of the protests. Will it have any effect on the chauvinists in society?\nI see it this way. I imagine most people in this day and age believe that the original remarks made no sense. To these people, the protests are preaching to the converted. It is those people of a misogynistic inclination whose minds the protestors are trying to change. But I can’t help thinking that the only thing these people will see is a group of scantily-clad women – sitting ducks for objectification, in their book. Assuming “objectification” isn’t too many syllables for them. Or “sitting”.\nIn short, I think the message will be lost on these people, as they won’t really be the type to look far enough beyond the surface of a person’s body to see their hearts or minds. In many ways, it seems like misogyny has won: the initial sexist comments have resulted in a mass of women, scantily clad, effectively providing cheap entertainment for chauvinists – whatever the actual intent. Does this help the cause?\nSo am I missing something? I honestly want to know if I am, so please challenge my views if you can. I’d also be interested to hear from men who have attended these marches – whichever side they were one. What effect do you think it’s had, if any at all? All comments absolutely welcome.\nJennieB said,\nJune 3, 2011 at 11:32 am\nHaving XX chromosomes I may not be the best person to answer on how men feel about this. However, I think, like any protest/demo, that if the message isn’t clear it will be lost on the majority of passers by – be they chauvinist or simply perplexed. Leaflets and banners will help!\nI like the Manchester Slut Walk manifesto: aimed at people who self-define as ‘slut’ or not, the key message is about the right to dress how you want to without fear of attack. The SOPHIE campaign has pretty much the same message after the horrid and pointless murder of beautiful Sophie Lancaster (http://www.sophielancasterfoundation.com).\nI don’t define myself as a slut – that’s my own personal take – but respect the decision of those who do. I do hope that men take part too in solidarity; men who choose to portray themselves differently can also be threatened. Finally, I believe that men can be feminists just as much as women can (it’s about equality y’all).\nGreat article John, and I would never question Alan Shearer’s parentage 😉",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_pointless-rants/content_177.html": "Gull Lover’s Travails.\nI have nothing against animal rights, nor indeed against those who wish to be nice to all things great and small. Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening. I’m hoping this won’t be the case.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_05_31_national-vegetarian-week/content_210.html": "National Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.\nMark Harrison said,\nMay 31, 2010 at 3:15 pm\nI know your problems, I am far from Veggy, in fact i don’t really think it’s a meal with out meat.\nBut my girlfriend is and with this comes the problem of I have to eat where she can eat.\nShe is also very fussy so this can involve looking at several menus to find something she can eat and will eat.\nI on the other hand just have to settle for what ever i want from the place she will eat.\nthis can take aloonnnng time.\njust thank god she not a F@*king Vegan!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_page_2/content_29.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nNorth East Skinny Dip 2013\nSeeing as last year’s event was so much fun, I’ve once again signed up to do the fabulous North East Skinny Dip!\nThis year, the event takes place on Sunday September 21st at sunrise, at the beautiful Druridge Bay in Northumberland.\nThis time around I can attest to how fantastic an experience it is. The water wasn’t particularly cold, and believe me, you don’t have to worry about anyone judging your imperfect body – if one thing is obvious at these events, it’s that nobody is perfect. It’s all about having some free-spirited fun, and raising some cash for charity.\nWanna join us? If so, here’s the registration page. It only costs a £10 to register.\nIf you don’t quite think you have the bottle, but still want to support the excellent mental health charity Mind, then here’s the oversized attention-seeking link:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nGo on, you only live once.\nFlipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nApples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nNight of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nTo Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might. And to force a rule in this situation would be Linguistic Nazism, and I’ll have to truck with that.\nRetrospection\nNo plays performed in front of major international stars this year, but you can’t have everything. Still, a lot of good stuff to look back upon.\nJanuary: Back to panto action, with the Washington Theatre Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.\nFebruary: Trip to Liverpool for the Green Party conference and some tourism.\nMarch: About forty different birthday booze-ups for Nigel’s 40th. Seemed like that anyway.\nApril: Performed in a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker. Took a trip into Darkest Yorkshire, too – somehow returning with a lot of beer.\nMay: Trip to London for a birthday. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that cake. I think I winced when the knife went in. Any man would. That should give you an idea of what shape it was.\nJune: Attempted a weekend break in Grizedale, but rain contrived to have half the campsite flooded. Despite this, a memorable trip if only for that wonderful game pie at the Eagle’s Head – the highlight of the 13-hour holiday. Performed this poem at the launch event for the Middlesbrough Literary Festival.\nJuly: A second camping trip, this time around the Northumbrian Coast, proved more successful. Great weather all over the place, and the fish and chips from Beadnell Bay are highly recommended.\nAugust: Took part in an anti-NF demo in Sunderland. The star of the NF show was the guy in the Chelsea shirt with “Essien” on the back. Michael Essien, a black foreigner, an immigrant with a job. Love the logic there.\nSeptember: Highlight of the year: The North-East Skinny Dip. Yes, jumping in the North Sea at 7 in the morning is the best thing that happened to me this year. Believe it or else. Flag bearer at Sunderland Pride, too. And interviewed by the same Sky reporter and both events.\nOctober: Unexpectedly found myself performing in The Edge of Darkness at The Royalty after an actor had to drop out due to illness on the final night. Scary experience, and an ironic one – I’m the smartarse who always knows his lines first, and I had to do the entire performance with a script.\nNovember: Started archery lessons with Whitburn Archers.\nDecember: Directing The Day after the Fair. Coming to a theatre near you soon. If you’re near The Royalty.\nRoll on 2013.\nDesert Island Albums\nOne problem with the whole desert-island-whatever thing is that, if you knew you were going to be stranded, possibly for years, with only about ten records, books, or whatever, you’d have to be pragmatic. Although the idea is that you choose your favourite ten, common sense would suggest otherwise. You’d probably want a bit of variety. You might be a big Led Zeppelin fan, for instance, but surely, for the whole time you were stuck on that island, you wouldn’t want all nine of their studio albums plus a compilation. You’d want something different on occasion. II and IV would probably suffice, possibly with Physical Graffiti if you didn’t think you could live without Kashmir.\nSo, this list of albums isn’t necessarily my 10 favourites. It’s probably closer to a list of favoured artists. I’ve made a few rules for this: firstly, no compilation albums. Greatest Hitses, Very Best Ofs and Now That’s What I Calls all feel a bit like cheating here. Secondly, no box sets, as they similarly feel like they don’t hit the spirit of the thing.\nAnd I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The reserves will be those that, should I find myself about to be stranded on a desert island with my record collection in front of me, I’d take if any of the main ten couldn’t be found. That seems fair. So, in no particular order:\nGeneration Terrorist – Manic Street Preachers\nFor those poor souls who think the Manics’ career began when A Design For Life made it big, let me educate you on something. That single was from their fourth album – which saw the beginning of the band’s slow collapse into nice commercial tunes. Before that, much of their creative genius came from Richey Edwards – a man often described as “troubled” by the press (not without cause – look up the 4 REAL incident), and who is now missing, presumed dead. And this first album might surprise those who so loved the strings and nice, friendly, pop guitars of their Everything Must Go offering. Because it’s brash, and full of anti-establishment sentiment. Motorcycle Emptiness will always be its best-known track, but You Love Us and Little Baby Nothing are right up there with it.\nA Night at the Opera – Queen\nEven if Greatest Hitses were allowed, this would still come in front of any of Queen’s compilations, for me. It was the album that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody (everybody’s favourite headbanging-in-cars tune), You’re My Best Friend and the questionable I’m in Love with my Car. But even these won’t stand out to everyone as the best – Death on Two Legs is wonderfully angry, and will probably remind you of every boss you ever hated. The Prophet’s Song is the ultimate murder-ballad, being eerie and apocalyptic. To counter these, we have the more jolly Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendezvous. It’s hard to imagine an album with a greater variety (especially as Bo-Rap itself has about six musical genres in one song). There’s not a bad track on the whole album, and to add to its brilliance, Brian May even plays ukulele on Good Company.\nMonster – R.E.M.\nNow then.\nTo my mind, this is the finest album ever made. And it will always remain so. No arguments, final word, no phoning a friend. Many will disagree – there were numerous music critics who thought that because it didn’t have the mainstream appeal of Out of Time or Automatic for the People, it wasn’t worth bothering about. Morons, I say. It’s certainly rockier than the previous two offerings, but hey, good bands should always be versatile. Crush with Eyeliner is my stand-out track, a gorgeous anti-love ballad, if that makes any sense. We have the better-known What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?, probably the only song ever based on a line shouted at a CBS anchorman by someone assaulting him with a bat. We have the lovely falsetto Tongue, Strange Currencies and number of other songs on themes of love, sex and identity, all as grungy and decadent as a diesel cheesecake. Buy it, now.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – David Bowie\nSo many Bowie albums to choose from, that I would be tempted to break the Greatest Hits rule. But if I had to pick one, it’d be this long-titled offering from the King of Glam. Even the cover of the LP is iconic, our Dave in his glam gear in Heddon Street, London. Ziggy Stardust, one of my favourite Bowie tracks, is the best on this album, but it’s in good company with Suffragette City and Starman – who can forgot the controversy this song caused when Bowie sang it on Top of the Pops, having the audacity to put his arm around Mick Ronson WHEN KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING. What sick filth, call the Daily Mail immediately. Before house prices drop or this blog gives you cancer.\nTwo Penny Opera – The Tiger Lillies\nA little-known band, but one with a worldwide following, and probably the band I’ve seen live the most. This is just one of the nigh-on thirty albums of theirs so far. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who might be easily offended, or might want to play the record in front of children, churchgoers or potential employers – especially if you’re after a Sunday School job. Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now. Anyway, in honour of the recent North-East Skinny Dip, an Anacreontic ode (good for upbeat celebration of something so free-spirited) on the fun we had…\nEau Naturel\nTwenty-second of September!\nWhat a morning to remember!\nScores of people in the nip,\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\nThere we stood at Druridge Bay,\nAt the very break of day.\nWaiting on the icy sand,\nDipping hour close at hand.\nFinally we got the call:\n“Okay, dippers – bear it all!”\nOff it came, right then and there,\nEverybody’s underwear.\nLiberated from our clothes,\nOff we ran, with frozen toes\nStraight into the foaming brine,\nAs the sun began to shine.\nHordes of people filled the sea,\nIn the name of charity.\nMen and women, young and old,\nBody sizes manifold.\nDodging waves, we swam about,\nFree and easy, wearing nowt.\nAll around were laughs and hoots,\nFrom the folk in birthday suits.\nProud to show their naked forms,\nChallenging the social norms.\nNot a body part seemed rude,\nWith so many in the nude.\nOnce we all had swum enough,\nOut we stumbled, in the buff.\nClothed and warm, we got some scran\nFrom the handy burger van.\nThis much needed body heat\nPut some feeling in my feet.\nBack home, I was pleased to find\nLoads of money raised for Mind;\nTV, radio and papers\nCovering our naked capers.\nBest of all, I think I’ve grown,\nChallenging my comfort zone –\nFor I’d had the guts to strip\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\n© John Appleton 2012",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_05_20_soldier-doctor-transsexual-copper/content_241.html": "Soldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!\nHave your say!",

Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.",

As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nVoices\nBeen a while since I posted. Time for a poem, I think.\nVoices\nI have some voices in my head\nThat tell me what to do.\nTheir names are Jub, and Flib, and Xed,\nThere’s Grimp and Weeble, too.\nOne day the voices said to me,\n“Hey Johnny, listen close,\nYou have to make a cup of tea,\nAnd then some buttered toast”.\nSo off I went to make my drink,\nObedient and dumb,\nI never even stopped to think\nWhat harm to me might come.\nBut ‘cos the tea had been so nice,\nThe voices gained my trust.\nEach day I’d hear from them twice,\nDid what they said I must.\nBut then one fateful day, they said,\n“Hey Johnny, listen here:\nYou must shoot someone in the head,\nAnd we’ll give you some beer.”\nI found a gun with perfect ease.\nAnd then a victim, too.\nI gave the trigger such a squeeze\nIt turned my fingers blue.\nThe fellow’s brains went everywhere,\nThe room was red as hell.\nThe took me into special care –\nA private padded cell.\nNow you might ask me if I rue\nThe mess that got me here.\nAnd I would say, “Of course I do –\nI never got the beer!”\n© John Appleton 2010",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_02/content_14.html": "Ruth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told.

The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_12_18_five-years-and-counting/content_244.html": "Five Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.\nHave your say!",

Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening.

As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nDesert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.",

As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better.

Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nGull Lover’s Travails.\nI have nothing against animal rights, nor indeed against those who wish to be nice to all things great and small. Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening. I’m hoping this won’t be the case.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_my-poetry/content_18.html": "My Poetry\nI consider poetry to be one of the finest art forms there is. It has something of an uncool image – though try going back in time and saying that to Byron’s face. But like any art form, poetry can be whatever you wish – angry, funny, sad, happy, weird, thought-provoking, dramatic, good, bad, avant-garde, lovey-dovey, dark, light, brainless, stupid, intelligent, uplifting or depressing. Most people will be able to think of examples of music for all of the above. No different with poetry.\nI began writing poetry back in my University days. I have to admit that I left a lot to be desired as a bard – a working knowledge of metre, for a start, though I was okay with rhyme. Yes, I know poetry needs neither – but that’s the sort of poetry that I generally prefer to read or write. I think it’s something to do with the puzzle element – trying to shape your thoughts so that they fit, as if it was some sort of lexical jigsaw puzzle. See this sestina of mine, for example.\nMy poetry was greatly improved a few years ago by the purchase of The Ode Less Travelled, by that lovely Stephen Fry. The book is written very much in his spoken style, with characteristic humour, but is also a very engaging tome upon metre, rhyme and form – and the understanding and practice thereof. It has exercises at every step – which I found very useful, some of which are now included in the body of my work.\nI’ve been much more fruitful poetically since reading that book. I now have seven sonnets, which makes me a 21th of the way to being the next Shakespeare. Hopefully, there’ll be a few more poems published here in the future.\nHave your say!",

The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nHave your say!",

Waste no time in exploiting it.\nThe Eighties\n1980: Come second in Cutest Baby Competition at Butlin’s. Prize is giant inflatable orange mouse, which spends the next year or so frightening the shit out of me.\n1981: Family moves to South Africa to seek fortune, which didn’t turn out to be there. Orange mouse accompanies us.\n1982: Apparently, I liked Dolly Parton. This explains a few things.\n1983: Earliest memory of a fondness for humorous wordplay, after noticing that a “TO LET” sign appeared to have a letter missing. To be fair, in 80’s Johannesburg, it probably did.\n1984: Fall face-first onto kitchen floor. Teeth scattered far and wide. One later turns up in Boise, Idaho.\n1985: Family moves to Botswana after dad gets job in a diamond mine. Destined forever to be asked “Did you steal any diamonds?” by people who seriously think it’s that simple.\n1985: Become convinced that 1985 happened twice. No-one believes me.\n1986: Write first ever computer programme (mine, not humanity’s), which prints “TREVOR IS DAFT” down the screen ad infinitum. Highly amused. Uncle Trevor not quite so amused.\n1987: First ever stage role, as member of chorus singing Any Dream Will Do in Joseph. Costume includes beach towel with picture of yacht on, which was presumably de rigeur in ancient Canaan.\n1988: Open birthday present to discover it’s a box of tools to fix bike. Feel all manly.

Have to decide between studying Performing Arts and IT at college. Foolishly take the sensible option.\n1995: Get drunk for the first time ever, aged 16 and 11 months. On two pints of lager. How times change.\n1996: Enrol at Sunderland University as computing student, but soon become student in drinking cheap beer, playing pool and skipping Friday afternoon lectures to drink cheap beer.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_03/content_153.html": "Night of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_falklands/content_108.html": "Las Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_06_30_religion/content_239.html": "Religion\nThis post has been inspired by a question asked on the Sunderland Green Party forum recently, and I thought it might be worth a blog post, as religion is something that interests me, in terms of how it affects me and society. The question is thus:\nWhat role should religion play…?\n1. In the lives of yourself and others\n2. In politics / public debate and policy\nThe first question: A simple answer is that it probably shouldn’t have to have any role, although even in this day and age, it doubtlessly will, even if by minor degrees. Days of the week, for instance, being named for deities. The England flags ubiquitous during international football tournaments have a Christian cross upon them. Streets, schools and other places are often named for saints or other religious figures. Of course, these are just roses by other names, and probably don’t have any influence on ourselves or society to any great extent.\nThen, of course, there are those aspects of religion that do have a part in our lives, and affect the things we do – even if we’re not religious. We take Good Friday and Easter Monday off work, for instance. In the past we’ve been restricted by Sunday trading laws. And I can confidently predict that later in the year, myself (a Pagan) and my friends Nigel (an atheist) and Charlotte (a Jew) will be sitting around a table in a pub swapping Christmas presents. We also have some very major religious influences. Extremism, terrorism, war – in this way, religion has affected everybody from Holocaust victims to those people prevented from taking liquids onto aeroplanes. In vastly different ways, of course, but religion has been there; if not as a direct cause, then as an excuse. These are roles that religion plays in our lives regardless of whether or not one has a religion. Where a person does subscribe to a faith, however, its influence will be even more profound – though not necessarily on the same level. It really depends upon how a person sees their religion.\nSome will see their religion as a philosophy, or set of philosophies, to explain life, the universe and everything. In this respect, it probably differs only from atheism in the presence of some supreme being or entity. This may be enough to play a serious role in a person’s life. Reverence of nature is part of Druid belief, and subscription to that faith may well encourage somebody to be more kind to nature. But there is also a legislative aspect to many religions. Christianity has many laws, for want of a better word. The best known of these are the Ten Commandments, though the bible, in particular the Old Testament, is full of many others. Many will see it important to keep to such tenets, as a way of keeping faith or attaining some higher station (entering Heaven, for instance). This can be a positive thing if it encourages such things as friendliness and respect, but not so good if it represses natural tendencies, such as alternate sexualities.\nReligious law, however, raises a good question concerning personal freedom. Yes, a person has freedom of religion – but should a person be free to believe in something that prevents them from being themselves (and therefore even more free)? The argument over niqabs is a classic example – is it a woman’s right to subscribe to a religion that compels her to wear one, or is it a woman’s right to bear her face in public regardless?\nHowever, the second question is a little different. I’d agree that people have a right to religion (you can’t stop people believing what they want anyway, metaphysical or otherwise), though I don’t think it has a place in politics. Religion is, after all, a belief, not a proven fact, and it would be highly irresponsible of any government to allow blind faith to affect its decisions. Any metaphysical theory has only a minute chance of ever being correct, and faith itself is very arbitrary. Therefore, laws enacted in the name of faith are arbitrary. In Tudor England, for example, Catholics were executed as heretics when Protestants were in power; when the Catholics ruled, Protestants were executed. Clearly, government cannot be fair if it is based upon the unproven beliefs of whomever might be in power. Such beliefs do not even have to be religious, of course – McCarthyism brought the same sort of issues as the Salem Witch Trials.\nGovernment must work upon what is known. We know that condoms prevent death and disease. We do not know if there is a deity out there who will banish us unto eternal torment for using them. In reality, it’s just as possible (and as improbable) that there is a deity out there ready to grant us eternal paradise for the same thing. If there were proof, of course, that Hell awaited us for such an act, there’d be reason for our government to protect our eternal souls. But unless we have that, we cannot make laws on blind assumptions – religious or not.\nOf course, this isn’t to say that a state’s laws should not make any reference to religion at all. It should still be realised that people have a right to religion, and a right to practise it. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people can do so equally. I’ve long thought it a shame that the Bank Holiday schedule in England is mostly based around Christian festivals (even if they’re only there to suppress Pagan ones). A Muslim might be happy to be given Easter off, if for no other reason than a break from work, but would that same person be happy to be working through Ramadan? (if you’re a Muslim, I’d be interested in your thoughts on that – not being one, I can’t answer it. You get the idea, anyway).\nHaving said this, it often irritates me that religion is often given an untouchable status, whereas other forms of philosophy are not. For example, if an employee refused to work a Sunday to attend church, many employers would submit to that, for fear of being labelled politically incorrect (at best). But I doubt the same would apply to somebody who wished to attend a political event, no matter how fervent their belief. If we recognise religious freedom in the law, we should also recognise other philosophical freedoms.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2014_08/content_64.html": "The Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.",

There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_10/content_185.html": "Free Speech – a lovely phrase. A democratic ideal, but perhaps unconsciously to many, one of those concepts that can all too often trigger an “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” response. Whilst many people will state that they agree with the idea of Free Speech, some of these will nonetheless call for the censorship of extreme views with which they do not approve. Two recent media events have been examples of Free Speech being used as a platform for views with which I certainly do not agree. This, of course, challenged me to consider my opinions on Free Speech.\nThe first of these incidents was Jan Moir’s repugnant Daily Mail article about the nature (or “unnature”, as she might have it), surrounding the death of Stephen Gately. This article, despite the fact that neither police nor coroner have ever suggested anything other than a death from natural causes, blamed his death on his homosexuality. Not in so many words, obviously – but the suggestion was plastered over the article. A massive internet backlash, lead by (among others) Derren Brown, Stephen Fry and a wonderfully scathing article by Charlie Brooker lead to a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission, and withdrawal of advertisments from the Daily Mail‘s website.\nThe second event was Nick Griffin’s appearance on Question Time. The BBC’s decision was criticised by many who considered that it would give the BNP more of a standing as a political party. I do wonder how many of such people would otherwise have defended free speech. In the event, Nick Griffin simply ended up making himself look like the uneducated bigot that many consider him to be – in showing a blatant ignorance of basic history and culture.\nBoth Nick Griffin and Jan Moir have expressed, on a vast public stage, opinions that to me are utterly despicable. But should they still be allowed to make these opinions public?\nHell yes.\nNick Griffin made himself look a fool. Jan Moir may have made a name for herself (I hadn’t previously heard of her), but it’s muddier than a Mississippi Mud Pie that’s fallen in Mud. I’m not sure who stated that “It’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt”, but I think that if we let the fools speak, it’s easier for us to recognise who they are. Intellectual evolution, really.\nPermalink\nLeave a Comment\n“If this doesn’t turn you into a raving Socialist,” she said, “Nothing will.” My friend was handing me a copy of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, by Irish workingman Robert Tressell. Preferring to keep an open mind on this grand claim, I took to reading it. At this point it might be prudent to describe my political leanings at the time I began reading. Swinging both ways, really – of the opinion that neither Capitalism nor Socialism held all of the answers.\nFor those unfamiliar with the book, it depicts the lives of a group of workers for a painting and decorating firm in the South of England, in the very early 20th century. We see the conditions under which the men have to work, often oppressed by their profit-minded masters – forced to work as shoddily and cheaply as possible to maximise profits. We see the men’s home lives, and how their poverty affects their wives, parents and children – very little to eat, or indeed to wear. We see the opposite side, the corrupt, yet affluent, lives of the masters – affected Christianity and corrupt control of the means of production and of council business.\nThe book itself is an engaging enough novel, with its occasional comedy and tragedy. But its intent is certainly to be more than entertaining. Throughout the book we are treated to the vision of Owen, one of the labourers, trying to convert his fellow workers to Socialist ideals. The workers themselves, by and large, dismiss these ideas, despite the obvious benefits they’d reap from such a system. Such is the indoctrination of these people that they believe that the status quo should remain because it’s simply the way things are. This is something I see all the time – workers will often happily accept the status quo because they don’t think that they have the authority, or the right, to question it. And it happens in other spheres of society, too. How long have people repressed homosexuality for fear that it wasn’t normal – and how many women have stayed at home to look after the kids and do the housework, because “that’s what’s supposed to happen”?\nThe book therefore, has a clear agenda – to promote Socialism. It would be very harsh to call it propaganda, but it is clearly didactic. And to very good effect. Socialism is not a term I’ve always understood. Dictionary definitions are usually too vague, the nature of dictionaries limiting defintions to a few lines. Encyclopaedic sources, even the internet kind without the limit of paper space, are often written academically, to be understood by those with a good knowledge of political or socio-economic jargon. Allegories, such as Animal Farm, can seem a bit too distant from the world of the reader, and so do not really afford any pathos. The explanations given in the book are perfectly understandable, and the setting of the novel around a group of working men, facing situations that even myself, as a white-collar worker, can relate to.\nMore importantly, the arguments for Socialism are convincing.\nIf they do want for anything, it is that the book portrays Socialism in the greatest light possible. It presents a dream of an almost Utopian world, with peace, harmony and utter contentment everywhere. Perhaps I’m cynical, but whatever benefits might arise from Socialism, I doubt that it would lead to a perfect world. A better world, quite possibly, but not perfect. Another problem, though not at all insurmountable, is the difference between the book’s world and the world of today. The two are very different, so perhaps the vision of Socialism presented to us by Tressell might not be fully workable in this day and age, but that’s no reason to simply give it up as a bad job.\nSo where am I politically now? More to the left, certainly. More questioning of the status quo. And undoubtedly more aware of the effects of Capitalism on society – I’m becoming more aware of the Co-operative and Fairtrade movements, and the benefits that such things provide. When you’ve grown up all of your life in a Capitalist society, as I have, it’s often difficult to miss them. I’m glad I can see things from another angle now.\nPermalink\n3 Comments",

But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_05_30_euro-2012-a-cynics-predictions/content_231.html": "Euro 2012 – A Cynic’s Predictions\nA cynic, of course, being what an optimist calls a realist. As the England team approaches the Euro 2012 competition, we can expect the usual waves of senseless optimism from the press and fans who’ve yet to learn any better. So to counteract this, I bring you the expectations of a hard-and-fast, dyed-in-the-wool cynic.\nLet’s start with the squad: We start the competition with a new man in charge, good old Roy Hodgson. A man who, admittedly, has some European pedigree, but also too much of a resemblance, in looks and demeanour, to Commandant Lassard out of Police Academy. This is quite apt, given that his caretaking predecessor in the hot-seat (Stuart Pearce) was a haircut away from being Zed from the same films, and Fabio Capello, the last full-time incumbent, was basically Sweetchuck with an accent. Hopefully, one day we’ll have a Tackleberry in charge, then we might actually get somewhere.\nAnd what a squad we’ve got. A week or so to go and players are already dropping like flies (or more accurately, like Christiano Ronaldo in a penalty box in injury time), ruling out Gareth Barry and others. But we do have Mr. Potato Head, aka Wayne Rooney, our star striker who’s banned for the first three matches (theoretically half the tournament, more likely three quarters of it, if we’re lucky). We have that indefatigable role model John Terry. Yes, you might think he’s a violent, mysoginstic, cheating, lying and smug racist, but he did win the Daddies Sauce Dad of the Year award in 2009 so that obviously makes everything okay. We have Captain Fantastic Steven Gerrard, who this season bravely led his team to 8th in the Premier League and a trophy that even Middlesbrough can win if they try hard enough, and I’m not talking about the North Riding Senior Cup. Gerrard is accompanied by his Liverpool team-mate Andy Carroll, a man who seems to model his looks, charm and general usefulness on Guy of Gisborne out of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Like Gisborne, Carroll was backed last season by a boss over-taxing his subjects (in that case, Kenny Dalglish taxing the minds of fans wondering why they’d spend £35 million for someone to stand in the penalty box, hoping that things bounce off him in the right direction now and again). There we have it – the Golden Generation, ready to bring that trophy back where it belongs. Because we invented football.\nSo now that we’re familiar with our set-up, onto the predictions. Firstly, the group stages:\nEngland vs France: France are the Old Enemy, when Scotland, Germany and Argentina aren’t around, that is. England fans will expect us to beat France, not just because we invented football, but because we’ll raise that fighting spirit that saw King Henry V and his tiny army defeat the French at Agincourt, and because we’re much more civilised than them – we don’t eat snails or frogs, and we don’t go on strike at the slightest things, like the government removing workers’ inalienable human rights (what children they are). The fact is, Agincourt was a tiny moment of light for England in the whole of the Hundred Years War (actually 116 years; they even had Fergie Time back then) and the French will simply muster the fighting spirit that saw them win the rest of it. I think England will actually do quite well on this one, they’ll be up for it: first game, grand opposition, and the team will pull their fingers out. A French goal in the first half will be cancelled out by an Ashley Young header in the second half after a decent spell of pressure from England. Thus it’ll finish 1-1. Post-match press conferences will state that it shows how well we can compete on a world stage, even though it’s really a North-west Europe stage. We’ll have lots of positives to draw from it, obviously, but hopefully not in the random drugs tests. In the other group match, Sweden will beat Ukraine 2-1. And so to…\nEngland vs Sweden: A team we’ve met in competitions on numerous occasions. England fans will expect us to beat Sweden, not just because we invented football, but because Sweden is a country made entirely of lakes (which would make it a sea, technically), and its only inhabitants are moose, flat-pack furniture makers and ABBA, and none of them are good at football (although Agnetha from ABBA allegedly had a trial at Doncaster Belles in her younger days. Seems she didn’t fare too well and kept asking what the Name of the Game was. Thankfully, a record producer was watching, and the rest is history). However, the same thing always seems to happen when we play Sweden, and I expect this to be no different. We’ll score after three minutes, and spurred on by that, go on to lose 3-1. Sweden’s first will come after 44 minutes, cueing footage of Roy Hodgson frantically scribbling a new half-time team talk. The next will come around the hour mark, and will be the token goalkeeper blooper that England are obliged to have in every tournament – a lame backpass from John Terry going through Joe Hart’s hands like an Audi through a 30mph zone. The final goal will come with about five minutes to spare, whereupon the England team will be looking at each other with incredulity, and hoping that Ukraine beat France. France will win, though, 2-0. So, France on four points, Sweden on six, Ukraine on none and the Golden Generation on a single, wondrous point.\nEngland vs Ukraine: So, we come to the crunch match. England have to win, and hope that France lose (which they won’t. 1-0 to Les Bleus). But of course, England fans will expect us to beat Ukraine, not just because we invented football, but because they have no points (compared to our awe-inspiring one), and their country has only existed for about 20 years. Nobody in England had heard of Ukraine before 1993, and that was only because Manchester United winger Andrei Kanchelskis happened to play for them. We’d heard of Chernobyl, but like anything East of Poland and North of those Arab countries, we thought it was Russia. We’d heard of Kiev, but only in the context of mechanically recovered chicken covered in breadcrumbs and stuffed with garlic-flavour cholesterol. So we’ll go into this game as cocky as you like, and proceed to trounce the former communists 0-0. To be fair, we’ll have a good share of chances, but these will all go to Andy Carroll, who’ll show the shooting skills of a blindfolded ostrich in a panic. The TV camera will shows numerous shots of Wayne Rooney, sitting there with his most tuberous po-face, wishing that he was out there, because he knows it wouldn’t be like this if he were playing. Commentators will point out that “this wasn’t in England’s script” as though it’s an entirely original metaphor. Post-match interviews will all include the phrase “Y’know, all credit to Ukraine, they really put in a shift”, without anyone actually willing to take any blame. Back home, the Daily Mail forecasts a slump in house prices in light of the deafeat.\nA day or two later, the England team are plastered all over the back pages arriving at Heathrow looking gloomier than Doncaster railway station. But the tournament isn’t over yet…\nQuarter and Semi-Finals: This year we seem to have two Groups of Death, and fearfully, Croatia and Portugal will be the teams falling at the first hurdle in each. Ireland will undergo their obligation to never do better than England (a pact reversed in the Eurovision Song Contest), so will slip out at the group stages too. Poland, despite being co-hosts, will simply be outdone, as will Denmark and Greece, leaving us with some usual suspects. Quarter-finals will see us lose Russia, the Czech Republic, Sweden and France, which will please some disgruntled English fans. The structure of the competition seems to work out so that semi-finalists might will have met each other at the group stages, so I’m expecting Germany to be playing the Netherlands, and Spain to play Italy. The first match will be won by Germany on Penalties, but not before Nigel de Jong has become the first player to be sent off three times in one game (and not because Graham Poll was refereeing). The first two red cards will be for the same “tackle”, just because it was so bad, and the third for a second yellow card after removing his shirt (how very dare he) as he walked off the pitch. Van Persie will miss the crucial penalty, sending Tottenham fans into raptures.\nThe second semi-final will be a stark contrast to the first, in that the first game was full of players you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley, and the second will be full of players you wouldn’t want your girlfriend to meet in a well-lit main street, just hours after you absent-mindedly hesitated on the “does-my-bum-look-big-in-this” question. It’ll be a hard-fought game between these two super-powers of world cuisine, only marred by Xabi Alonso’s constant attempts to better his record 70-yard goal, not realising that a fumble-footed Geordie bench-warmer isn’t between the sticks this time. Spain, however, will pull through, winning by a single goal.\nThe Final: Germany vs Spain. Germany, that country of super-efficency, methodical work and cars for people who want them to last. Spain, that country of cruelty to bulls, afternoon kips and cars for people who think The Fast and the Furious is compelling cinema. A true clash of European cultures. A perfect end to this grand tournament. Spain’s flair will show from the off, and within half an hour, they’ll grab the game’s first goal. However, their flair will not last much longer, as the Germans’ ruthless efficiency (nicked from the Spanish Inquisition, oddly) will begin to tell, and an equaliser will follow shortly after half-time. Then, with about fifteen minutes to go, Germany’s Schweinsteiger (which I’m sure was used as a euphemism for a gentleman’s member in Young Frankenstein) will grab the winner. Cue wild scenes of celebration from Berlin and Munich, and shots of Spanish fans, their faces painted in red and yellow, crying like Gazza after being kicked out of a kebab shop. Scores of English commentators will say, “well, we always say ‘Never write off the Germans'”, even though they wrote them off completely at the start of the tournament due to their age and lack of flair, as is traditional in British broadcasting. Adrian Chiles will sign-off the coverage with his trademark unfunny “witticism”, and that’ll be it for another couple of years.\nSo there you have it, another roallercoaster of a tournament, with the usual thrills, spills and other things that rhyme and might just about mean something appropriate. So my money’s going on Germany, and anyone who plays England. Let’s face it, we know it makes sense.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_nudity/content_5.html": "North East Skinny Dip 2013\nSeeing as last year’s event was so much fun, I’ve once again signed up to do the fabulous North East Skinny Dip!\nThis year, the event takes place on Sunday September 21st at sunrise, at the beautiful Druridge Bay in Northumberland.\nThis time around I can attest to how fantastic an experience it is. The water wasn’t particularly cold, and believe me, you don’t have to worry about anyone judging your imperfect body – if one thing is obvious at these events, it’s that nobody is perfect. It’s all about having some free-spirited fun, and raising some cash for charity.\nWanna join us? If so, here’s the registration page. It only costs a £10 to register.\nIf you don’t quite think you have the bottle, but still want to support the excellent mental health charity Mind, then here’s the oversized attention-seeking link:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nGo on, you only live once.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now. Anyway, in honour of the recent North-East Skinny Dip, an Anacreontic ode (good for upbeat celebration of something so free-spirited) on the fun we had…\nEau Naturel\nTwenty-second of September!\nWhat a morning to remember!\nScores of people in the nip,\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\nThere we stood at Druridge Bay,\nAt the very break of day.\nWaiting on the icy sand,\nDipping hour close at hand.\nFinally we got the call:\n“Okay, dippers – bear it all!”\nOff it came, right then and there,\nEverybody’s underwear.\nLiberated from our clothes,\nOff we ran, with frozen toes\nStraight into the foaming brine,\nAs the sun began to shine.\nHordes of people filled the sea,\nIn the name of charity.\nMen and women, young and old,\nBody sizes manifold.\nDodging waves, we swam about,\nFree and easy, wearing nowt.\nAll around were laughs and hoots,\nFrom the folk in birthday suits.\nProud to show their naked forms,\nChallenging the social norms.\nNot a body part seemed rude,\nWith so many in the nude.\nOnce we all had swum enough,\nOut we stumbled, in the buff.\nClothed and warm, we got some scran\nFrom the handy burger van.\nThis much needed body heat\nPut some feeling in my feet.\nBack home, I was pleased to find\nLoads of money raised for Mind;\nTV, radio and papers\nCovering our naked capers.\nBest of all, I think I’ve grown,\nChallenging my comfort zone –\nFor I’d had the guts to strip\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\n© John Appleton 2012\nNude Glorious Nude\n(Oliver-based title pun, ‘cos the production currently at Newcastle Theatre Royal is very worth seeing. But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.\nNorth-East Skinny Dip\nYes. You read that right. Hopefully it’ll be a world record for the biggest number of naked idiots jumping into the sea at once. That’s gotta be worth a few sponsorship pounds.\nThe North-East Skinny Dip is taking place on Saturday 22nd September at very silly o’clock in the morning, in the North Sea (see idiots comment earlier). We’re doing it for a very worthy charity (MIND, a national mental health charity), as well as for an cracking answer to the question, “So, done anything interesting lately?”. I think it’s difficult to beat.\nBut here’s the important bit where I try to get you to part with your hard-earned: There’s a single sponsorship page (under one person’s name, but it all goes to the same charity), so that we don’t all have to mess about with creating hundreds of JustGiving pages (and so that if you know more than one of us but want to sponsor us all, that’s easier). Anyway, to make the sponsorship link nice and easy to spot, here it is in stupidly big format:\nSPONSOR US HERE!!!!!!!\nThanks in advance if you do choose to donate some cash to this very worthy cause. Alternatively, if you’d actually like to take part, the registration site is here (and see the link to the Facebook event page above – invite your friends – or your enemies). Wish us luck!\nArtistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2014_06_19_washington-redskins-back-to-the-present/content_84.html": "Washington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_10_26_free-speech/content_230.html": "Free Speech\nFree Speech – a lovely phrase. A democratic ideal, but perhaps unconsciously to many, one of those concepts that can all too often trigger an “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” response. Whilst many people will state that they agree with the idea of Free Speech, some of these will nonetheless call for the censorship of extreme views with which they do not approve. Two recent media events have been examples of Free Speech being used as a platform for views with which I certainly do not agree. This, of course, challenged me to consider my opinions on Free Speech.\nThe first of these incidents was Jan Moir’s repugnant Daily Mail article about the nature (or “unnature”, as she might have it), surrounding the death of Stephen Gately. This article, despite the fact that neither police nor coroner have ever suggested anything other than a death from natural causes, blamed his death on his homosexuality. Not in so many words, obviously – but the suggestion was plastered over the article. A massive internet backlash, lead by (among others) Derren Brown, Stephen Fry and a wonderfully scathing article by Charlie Brooker lead to a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission, and withdrawal of advertisments from the Daily Mail‘s website.\nThe second event was Nick Griffin’s appearance on Question Time. The BBC’s decision was criticised by many who considered that it would give the BNP more of a standing as a political party. I do wonder how many of such people would otherwise have defended free speech. In the event, Nick Griffin simply ended up making himself look like the uneducated bigot that many consider him to be – in showing a blatant ignorance of basic history and culture.\nBoth Nick Griffin and Jan Moir have expressed, on a vast public stage, opinions that to me are utterly despicable. But should they still be allowed to make these opinions public?\nHell yes.\nNick Griffin made himself look a fool. Jan Moir may have made a name for herself (I hadn’t previously heard of her), but it’s muddier than a Mississippi Mud Pie that’s fallen in Mud. I’m not sure who stated that “It’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt”, but I think that if we let the fools speak, it’s easier for us to recognise who they are. Intellectual evolution, really.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_yorkshire/content_63.html": "Apples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_apples-on-tour/content_59.html": "Apples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nApples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nNight of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nApples on Tour – The Northumbrian Coast\nThere are three principal reasons that I think the North of England rocks. These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches. Next year, perhaps…\nApples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nApples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop. No time to visit Anfield, unfortunately, but I did at least get to watch Liverpool’s penalty shoot-out win in the League Cup Final. Come on you Reds.\nSo, I have not been disappointed by this eagerly-awaited trip. There’s probably a lot more to discover about Liverpool, as there always will be with any place. So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_hats/content_146.html": "Apples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_12/content_56.html": "Apples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_liverpool/content_41.html": "Apples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_05_20_soldier-doctor-transsexual-copper/content_213.html": "Soldier, Doctor, Transsexual, Copper.\nNot a lot of posts for a while here, but it’s been a busy year so far – mostly due to a number of acting commitments, each of which has been noteworthy, to me at any rate. As such, it seems a shame that they have yet to get any mention on this blog, so I’m going to try to make up for this.\nAt the beginning of the year, rehearsals for Macbeth, staged in an Edwardian dress at the Royalty, were in full swing. In this I had two parts – The Captain who dies as the start, and the Doctor who watches Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks. Not major parts, but, as the Bard says, “The play’s the thing”. At least the parts required something different – one a desperate soldier at death’s door, the other a calm and collected medic.\nThe part of the Captain was good for releasing some steam. It takes a bit more energy than normal to be in anguish for even a few minutes, but it’s fun. Covered in fake blood too – some corn-syrup concoction, which is very sticky. The shirt to which much of it was applied was ripping the hairs from my chest toward the end of the run. Once that was over, I could regenerate into the Doctor, and take to the stage for the sleepwalking. This was staged without the Gentlewoman; her lines and the Doctor’s were given to me to present as though giving a lecture, the audience being my students. Having watched Lady Mac slip into insanity, the remainder of my scenes were spent watching Macbeth do more or less the same.\nSo, much fun had, and that was one ambition realised – to do some Shakespeare. Memorable enough, for such a fan of his writing as I am. there was icing on this particular cake, however. The second performance was attended by Sir Ian McKellen – an actor whom many consider to be the finest practitioner of Shakespeare alive, and whom I’ve had the pleasure of seeing as King Lear. Thankfully, the adage that one should never meet their heroes was dealt a blow, as the good Sir Knight proved charming and friendly, mingling with the audience after the show and taking time to speak to the cast indivudally. This Shakespearean experience was topped off by a further performance of a few scenes to a school, a month or so later at Sunderland Museum.\nAfter that, I’d perhaps be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the year might be an anti-climax. But while it might be the abiding memory of the year, the next four months were not devoid of their own excitement. February saw me branch out a little further, getting the main part in a short student film, along with another member of the Washington Theatre Group. This film, Rid of You, is basically about a fellow who’s decided that he wants to spend the rest of his life as a woman.\nI was aware that this wouldn’t be entirely the same as stage work, and two major differences made themselves apparent very quickly. One is the detail. Close-up shots give every nuance of expression and movement the chance to be noticed. On stage, you’re often at least ten feet from any audience member, and a slight movement of the eyes won’t always be detected. On film, it can speak volumes.\nThen there was the stop-start nature of scenes. As a scene can be shot from numerous angles, there will be times when a shot might be less than three seconds. It’s not always easy to go straight into a character for the sake of a quick expression. On stage, you’re usually already in character when it’d needed. As I write, I’ve yet to see the final cut, but I hope that I’ve managed to handle these well enough.\nDoing this was enjoyable, and there are some experiences that’ll stay with me. Filming on a freezing cold beach in March, with feet in the water. The things I do for the craft, eh? There was also a scene in a bath (no nudity, you’ll be glad to know) and a very cool dream sequence which required some choreography – and looked quite spooky when I saw some shots of a rehersal. Oh yes, and then there was the make-up and stocking sequences. I won’t say too much about these, but I think some residents of Sunderland will be scarred for life. Humorous to think that the previous day, those people might even have been voting for me in the local elections.\nWhile this was winding down, I began to rehearse Funny Money at the Royalty. I played Detective Sergeant Davenport, a Cockney wide-boy policeman, none-too worried about taking the odd backhander. The play is a classic farce – confusion, mistaken identities, dead people turning up everywhere. And for myself, yet another stab at a genre I’d yet to encounter. Farce might be looked down upon by many, as comedy often is (how often do you see comedies getting the Best Picture Oscar?), but that doesn’t mean that it takes no skill. Far from it – the pace must be flawless, especially when things are getting frantic. In a more stoic play, an actor can get away with fumbling in his or her mind for a line and masking it as a dramatic pause, but there’s rarely scope for that in farce. So it certainly was a challenge – this was the biggest part I’d had at the Royalty. But the pace required actually helps. You get less time to remember that you’re an actor, and it’s easier to go through the motions as you remember them from so many rehearsals.\nSo yeah, a hectic time. But I am an amateur, and I do it because I enjoy it. Like most endeavours in life, you get from acting what you put into it. All this work has garnered new knowledge, skills, experiences and friends. Bring on some more of this!\nHave your say!",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_11_17_boardroom-quotas/content_90.html": "Boardroom Quotas\nNovember 17, 2015 at 4:11 pm (Politics) (Baseball, Politics, Racism, Sexism, Social Justice, Sport)\nThe idea of boardroom quotas, or any kind of employment quotas for women, will probably always be contentious. Accusations of “positive discrimination” will fly around, even from progressive people. I can understand both sides of this argument.\nBut let’s look at the idea of quotas from another angle.\nBack in the 1940s, Major League Baseball in the US had an unofficial colour bar. There was nothing in the laws of the sport to prevent a Major League team from playing a black man, but it was something that just didn’t happen. There were many black players, but these men had to content themsleves with playing in the Negro leagues.\nHowever, the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, knew that there was a vast amount of talent in the Negro leagues, and thought it foolish that he couldn’t use their talent due to an unwritten rule of the sport. So he decided that he would sign a single black player, to prove that their inclusion could benefit the game, rather than spoil it.\nThe player he chose was Jackie Robinson. On April 15th 1947, Robinson made his Major League debut. The debut was not a remarkable one (regarding his performance at least), but over the summer he grew to be a hit with fans and media. Other clubs took notice. Slowly, the colour bar crumbled and fell. Today, April 15th is celebrated as Jackie Robinson Day, his shirt number (42) is the only one retired from all MLB teams, and to look at any Major League team, no-one would imagine that there was ever an issue with racial inclusion in the sport.\nBranch Rickey had essentially given himself a quota. One might say this was positive discrimination, that a white man might have lost his place in the team due to tokenism. One might also argue that Jackie Robinson might have been as good, or better than that white man, and was therefore deserving of his place. But this is a major point in my argument – it was important for Rickey to find a black player who would be a success and who could honestly say that he’d earned the right to be part of the team. Had he chosen just any black player for the sake of inclusion, that player might have proved a bad choice – which would have set the whole issue far back.\nThe issue of female quotas bears little difference to this – if a woman’s skills prove that she is good enough, a quota should not be an issue. It may indeed prevent a man from getting the same job because of his gender – but what’s often forgotten is that to redress any inequality, one must take an action that is itself unequal. Looking at it mathematically, if we have two numbers, 3 and 5, which we want to make equal, we must do something to one number that we don’t do to the other.\nThis is why we have International Women’s Day but don’t really bother with the male equivalent. It’s why we have an LGBT rights movement and not a straight/cis rights movement. Use the term “positive discrimination” all you like, but take a moment to remember what “positive” means. It’s not necessarily a bad thing.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_travel/content_175.html": "Apples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.\nApples on Tour – South Manchester\n“What?” I hear you ask. “Manchester? For a holiday? Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nNight of the Living Chefs\nI often get asked to recount this story, whenever somebody finds out that something odd once happened involving a roundabout, men in chef’s outfits, and Ireland. And I’m happy to recount it, but I always have to give my audience a disclaimer: “You really had to be there”. However, this never cools their ardour for the story, and by the end of the tale, they’re covered in tumbleweed. So to avoid any more such unpleasantness, I’ll lay the tale before you all now.\nBut I’ll say it again: You had to be there. I can take no further responsibility. You’re free to leave now, and I won’t hold it at all against you.\nYou HAVE been warned. So, are you sitting comfortably?\nNight of the Living Chefs\nThat fateful Thursday in 2001, none of us could have predicted what would happen. We were simply four young people on a weekend away, far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, just hoping to have a good time. But we were completely unaware of what fate was to throw at us.\nWe’d taken a morning flight from Teesside to Dublin. It was a chilly, overcast day, but thankfully free of rain. We had landed in Dublin sometime around noon, and had hung around the city centre for a while until we were able to check into our hotel.\nThe Travelodge at Castleknock, about 5 miles outside of Dublin. How we still shiver at the memories.\nIt was a comfortable place, in truth, and cheap enough, that being the hallmark of the Travelodge. But this isn’t really about the hotel. It’s about THAT roundabout, the one where the M50 intersects with the N3. A roundabout that would forever be etched upon our minds, where the nightmare of men in chef’s outifts would eternally haunt us.\nHaving checked in at the hotel, we went to our rooms. Myself and Nigel in one (twin room, thank you), and Kirsty and Alison in the other. The girls decided to have a bit of a lie-down, But Nige and I, being young gentlemen in search of a good time, decided to venture forth to seek the pubs. We left the hotel, and headed for civilisation on the other side of the roundabout.\nAnd that’s when I saw the first one.\nStanding in the grassed area in the middle of the roundabout, by himself, with apparently no purpose, was a man in a chef’s outfit.\nHe was just standing there, looking around. Why, I wondered to myself, would a lone man, in a chef’s outfit, be standing in the middle of a roundabout on a busy road?\nIt sent shivers down my spine. And then I saw the second one.\nThe second man, also in a chef’s outfit. Also just looking around, apparently without purpose. No other obvious connection to the first man – but eerily, both dressed in the same style. Both doing nothing, but with a sense of foreboding. Like those Weeping Angels in Doctor Who. Only in chef’s outfits.\nCompose yourself, I told myself. This is Ireland. Maybe it’s just one of those things they do, like Gaelic football, or poteen, or taking the Pope seriously. As we wandered toward the roundabout, to cross the road, I saw the third.\nThe third man, in a chef’s outfit. But he was unlike the other two. He was carrying a tray. A silver tray. With nothing upon it. What’s more, he wasn’t simply standing and looking around. He was walking. Walking toward the second man. Walking, and pointing at him. And saying something, possibly in some long-forgotten chthonic language; the language of demons. Or maybe just English.\nWell, this was more than my mind could handle. I vowed to myself that nothing here could really hurt me, like Danny in The Shining. With great speed, Nigel and I crossed the busy road, avoiding these inhuman monsters, and headed for the nearest pub, stopping only to inquire of a couple of street urchins as to exactly where the nearest pub was.\nReaching the safety of this homely tavern, we refreshed our spirits with some fine local beverages, until we were ready to return to the hotel – fully aware that those men in chef’s outfits would be there. But we couldn’t let that stop us. Those Gourmets of Darkness could, at any moment, bear down upon the hotel in which our friends were innocently sleeping. We were their only hope. We had to return, and keep them safe from a terrible fate.\nWe left the tavern, the owner having provided us with rosary beads and crucifixes to protect us from any evil we might encounter. Our hearts thumping like a Citroën’s engine in the wrong gear, we advanced toward the roundabout. And there they were, the three of them, standing in the middle of the roundabout, a veritable hive of demonic activity. From a hatch in a van they were taking cups. And passing them to drivers. No doubt goblets of some vile potion, made to induce madness on humanity, whereupon these Epicurean demons would execute some infernal plan to take over God’s green Earth.\nI had to do something. I had wooden stakes, silver bullets and garlic bulbs, which had been sent to me in haste by my old university lecturer, Van Helsing of Amsterdam. One must admire the speed of the postal service. With the courage of Hercules, I strode toward one demon, and in a tremulous voice, asked him what his business among humanity was.\nBasically, they were handing out free pancakes to motorists as a promotion. So we got one each, and took some back for the lasses as well.\nSo…yeah.\nApples on Tour – The Northumbrian Coast\nThere are three principal reasons that I think the North of England rocks. These are, in no particular order:\na) The fish and chips\nb) The countryside\nc) It just does, so there.\nIn terms of the countryside, look at what we have – the Lake District. The North York Moors. The Yorkshire Dales. Northumberland National Park. The Peak District (ok, Midlandsish, but North enough). And right at the top of England, on its Easternmost extremity, is the Northumbrian coast. It’s designated as an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”, and rightly so, as I discovered this weekend. Sure, I’ve been to the odd bit of it now and again, but haven’t taken in the coastline to any great extent before.\nIt was the second attempt at a camping trip for us this Summer. I say attempt, as the last one was a bit of a failure, the campsite almost becoming the district’s newest lake after rain that would have had Noah cancelling the milk and papers for the next six weeks. This time, I wasn’t optimistic about it not happening again, as the BBC weather was predicting more rain. Thankfully, the BBC weather appeared to have been done by Mystic Meg. The reason for the trip was Kate’s birthday, and Kate being the swimming type, the reason for the location was for a bunch of people to get some sea swimming done.\nOur base camp, if you like, was the Beadnell Bay Camping and Caravan Club site, right on the coast, just south of Seahouses. Nige and I turned up at about half past two, got the tents up and sat down for a good, afternoon/evening’s drink, punctuated with a game of Boules. Seriously. When everybody had arrived, we got off to the pub, to discover that they’d stopped serving food at 9pm. Hence, tea was crisps.\nNext day, a bunch of the swimmers went off to Low Newton for a dip, as some of us landlubbers went on a beach walk up to seahouses. Glorious sunshine all the way. It was a good long walk that culminated in a car boot sale and a sausage sarnie, very much welcome after our limited tea. Then it was back to the campsite for lunch. Some chose to have a barbie, but I, keeping in mind item a) on the list above, headed for the chippy. Proper seaside fish and chips they were, thoroughly beautiful. Beadnell’s Fish and Chips, the place was, if you’re ever in the area.\nAfter lunch, we headed off to Lindisfarne, or Holy Island – some to swim, others to watch others swim and take in the sites. Not for us the castle, priory or locally-made crab sandwiches, no – a good long walk over the island took us to a beautiful clear beach with rocky outcrops reminiscent of the Giant’s Causeway, just without that hexagon look going on.\nWhile I wandered around the rocks trying to find interesting things, the swimmers were having a great time, surrounded by shoals of fish and curious seals, popping their heads above the water to find out who these odd creatures in the funny rubber suits were. After an hour or so, we were back off to the campsite, to ready ourselves for another evening in the pub. We were in time for food this time, and somehow managed to wangle free pudding thanks to Pamela. I was mocked for putting custard on my cheesecake, but it tasted pretty good, so I stand by my decision whole-heartedly. Entertainment was provided by a friend of Kate who was in the pub by sheer coincidence – electro-acoustic versions of various songs from days when music was good. Christ, that makes me sound old.\nSunday morning brought a further beach trip for (watching) swimming. This time it was Sugar Sands, just a short drive from Longhoughton – or a long one, given the lack of signage and the cunning access point that look like you’re about to drive into someone’s farm (you drive though it, actually). Another sunny day, another nice blue beach. Not so much rockery to look around this time, but we did get a good look at a Sea King helicopter doing its thing, presumably just making sure that nobody was in trouble. Nice to know, really. After that, it was off to Alnwick for a coffee and a scone (Grannie’s or something, it was), before heading back home.\nHaving recently tried swimming again for the first time in about 20 years, albeit in an indoor pool, I was quite jealous of all the swimming that got done in all these fabulous beaches. Next year, perhaps…\nApples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nApples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop. No time to visit Anfield, unfortunately, but I did at least get to watch Liverpool’s penalty shoot-out win in the League Cup Final. Come on you Reds.\nSo, I have not been disappointed by this eagerly-awaited trip. There’s probably a lot more to discover about Liverpool, as there always will be with any place. So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_07_22_faster-higher-stranger/content_159.html": "Faster, Higher, Stranger\nThe Olympics continues to generate mixed feelings for me. Not so much the impending London Olympiad, more the whole concept of it. Or at least, what it has become.\nFact is, I love the idea of it. That the finest athletes from a round the globe can descend upon one city and give a showcase of their sport, and sport in general. Sport is an important thing; it is to the physical what science is to the mental, and what art is to the emotional. It can be as inspirational as science or art, and can promote confidence and team work just as much as science and art. It also has the obvious health benefits. To advertise sport on a global level, as the Olympics no doubt does, is therefore a good thing.\nThis idea of it being a celebration of elite sport, and perhaps sportsmanship, is one that has always been handed to us, by the media and society. And that’s how I viewed it when I first encountered the Olympics. That was the Seoul Olympiad of 1998, when I was ten. My single memory of that is Ben Johnson’s disqualification for the use of steroids. Completely against the idea of sportsmanship, obviously, but the disqualification seemed to me to show that sportsmanship was the central value of the Olympics. Transgressors would be found and punished, and sporting integrity would reign supreme once more.\nThe 1992 and 1996 Olympics, as far as my teenage self was concerned, were also good, enjoyable sporting events that showcased sport, and presented it in the right light. Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell shone in 1992, and it proved to me for the first time how good the Olympics was at highlighting fringe sports. I have memories of watching Simon Terry win bronze for Britain in the Archery (he’s back this year, too). I’m sure around this period, the Winter Olympics had me hooked on Curling as well.\nBut as we went through the games in Athens, Sydney and Beijing, things seemed to change. More and more, athletes were being caught by the doping people. These would often be followed by denials, rightly or wrongly. In any case, the amount of these cases hardly helped the Olympics to retain its reputation for sportsmanship.\nAnd as we’ve become accustomed in this day and age, the sponsorship seems to be increasingly ludicrous. Official thises-and-thats of each Olympiad take up advertising space in any medium that’ll have it. I’ll not be surprised to see allegations of ambush marketing at London 2012, as we saw in the South Africa World Cup in 2010. And we’ve already heard stories saying that spectators will be searched for their own food and drink before being allowed entry to events.\nWhich brings me to London 2012. From ludicrous ticket pricing systems (computer took ten minutes to tell me a ticket was available for football, THEN told me I’d have to pay £6 for postage. I declined.) to residents of London tower block putting in complaints about artillery being placed on top of their buildings, much of the preparation for this Olympiad has seemed little more than a ridiculous farce. And I’m not confident that this image will be shaken off during or after the games.\nThis said, I’ll no doubt still end up watching a fair bit of it (the Archery schedules have already been bookmarked). The basic principles of the Olympics, or what I considered them to be, will not entirely have dissipated. We will still have top class athletes who want fair competition, so it seems unfair to deny them the chance to show us their capabilities just because the powers that be might have porridge for brains. Unfortunately, when you have fools at the top, their foolishness blinds them from their foolishness, so it might be a while before things change. Oh well.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_12_09_nelson-mandela/content_136.html": "Nelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.\nTony Appleton said,\nDecember 9, 2013 at 6:41 am\nVery well put, Forgive but don’t forget.\nbtrowes63 said,\nJanuary 8, 2014 at 8:18 pm\nFinally found you, Apples.

Hopefully it’ll be a world record for the biggest number of naked idiots jumping into the sea at once. That’s gotta be worth a few sponsorship pounds.\nThe North-East Skinny Dip is taking place on Saturday 22nd September at very silly o’clock in the morning, in the North Sea (see idiots comment earlier). We’re doing it for a very worthy charity (MIND, a national mental health charity), as well as for an cracking answer to the question, “So, done anything interesting lately?”.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_category_politics/content_85.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nThe 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nThe Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.\nWashington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.\nFlipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nAlan Turing’s Centenary\nHe might have been 100 this coming weekend. You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.\nPoetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_desert-island/content_105.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nDesert Island Albums\nOne problem with the whole desert-island-whatever thing is that, if you knew you were going to be stranded, possibly for years, with only about ten records, books, or whatever, you’d have to be pragmatic. Although the idea is that you choose your favourite ten, common sense would suggest otherwise. You’d probably want a bit of variety. You might be a big Led Zeppelin fan, for instance, but surely, for the whole time you were stuck on that island, you wouldn’t want all nine of their studio albums plus a compilation. You’d want something different on occasion. II and IV would probably suffice, possibly with Physical Graffiti if you didn’t think you could live without Kashmir.\nSo, this list of albums isn’t necessarily my 10 favourites. It’s probably closer to a list of favoured artists. I’ve made a few rules for this: firstly, no compilation albums. Greatest Hitses, Very Best Ofs and Now That’s What I Calls all feel a bit like cheating here. Secondly, no box sets, as they similarly feel like they don’t hit the spirit of the thing.\nAnd I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The reserves will be those that, should I find myself about to be stranded on a desert island with my record collection in front of me, I’d take if any of the main ten couldn’t be found. That seems fair. So, in no particular order:\nGeneration Terrorist – Manic Street Preachers\nFor those poor souls who think the Manics’ career began when A Design For Life made it big, let me educate you on something. That single was from their fourth album – which saw the beginning of the band’s slow collapse into nice commercial tunes. Before that, much of their creative genius came from Richey Edwards – a man often described as “troubled” by the press (not without cause – look up the 4 REAL incident), and who is now missing, presumed dead. And this first album might surprise those who so loved the strings and nice, friendly, pop guitars of their Everything Must Go offering. Because it’s brash, and full of anti-establishment sentiment. Motorcycle Emptiness will always be its best-known track, but You Love Us and Little Baby Nothing are right up there with it.\nA Night at the Opera – Queen\nEven if Greatest Hitses were allowed, this would still come in front of any of Queen’s compilations, for me. It was the album that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody (everybody’s favourite headbanging-in-cars tune), You’re My Best Friend and the questionable I’m in Love with my Car. But even these won’t stand out to everyone as the best – Death on Two Legs is wonderfully angry, and will probably remind you of every boss you ever hated. The Prophet’s Song is the ultimate murder-ballad, being eerie and apocalyptic. To counter these, we have the more jolly Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendezvous. It’s hard to imagine an album with a greater variety (especially as Bo-Rap itself has about six musical genres in one song). There’s not a bad track on the whole album, and to add to its brilliance, Brian May even plays ukulele on Good Company.\nMonster – R.E.M.\nNow then.\nTo my mind, this is the finest album ever made. And it will always remain so. No arguments, final word, no phoning a friend. Many will disagree – there were numerous music critics who thought that because it didn’t have the mainstream appeal of Out of Time or Automatic for the People, it wasn’t worth bothering about. Morons, I say. It’s certainly rockier than the previous two offerings, but hey, good bands should always be versatile. Crush with Eyeliner is my stand-out track, a gorgeous anti-love ballad, if that makes any sense. We have the better-known What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?, probably the only song ever based on a line shouted at a CBS anchorman by someone assaulting him with a bat. We have the lovely falsetto Tongue, Strange Currencies and number of other songs on themes of love, sex and identity, all as grungy and decadent as a diesel cheesecake. Buy it, now.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – David Bowie\nSo many Bowie albums to choose from, that I would be tempted to break the Greatest Hits rule. But if I had to pick one, it’d be this long-titled offering from the King of Glam. Even the cover of the LP is iconic, our Dave in his glam gear in Heddon Street, London. Ziggy Stardust, one of my favourite Bowie tracks, is the best on this album, but it’s in good company with Suffragette City and Starman – who can forgot the controversy this song caused when Bowie sang it on Top of the Pops, having the audacity to put his arm around Mick Ronson WHEN KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING. What sick filth, call the Daily Mail immediately. Before house prices drop or this blog gives you cancer.\nTwo Penny Opera – The Tiger Lillies\nA little-known band, but one with a worldwide following, and probably the band I’ve seen live the most. This is just one of the nigh-on thirty albums of theirs so far. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who might be easily offended, or might want to play the record in front of children, churchgoers or potential employers – especially if you’re after a Sunday School job. Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.\nDesert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04_22_apples-on-tour-todmorden-et-al/content_23.html": "Apples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nRetrospection « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 28, 2012 at 4:08 pm\n[…] a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker.

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_vegetarianism/content_170.html": "National Vegetarian Week\nHaving realised some time ago that National Vegetarian Week was on its way, I thought it might be fun to try to live as a vegetarian for the week. Not with any intention of becoming a vegetarian, it must be said – that’s probably as likely as the Pope marrying Elton John. It was more of a put-yourself-in-someone-else’s-shoes exercise. Here’s how I fared on a day-to-day basis:\nMonday 24th May: Lunch was fairly simple to do veggie-style. Normally the only meat in my packed lunch is in the sandwich, so this was replaced by “meat-style” soya slices, of a chicken and sage-and-onion flavour. It wasn’t bad; like most meat substitutes, it’s not quite the real thing, but nice enough. For tea, fish-style finger sarnies. I love real fish fingers, these weren’t too bad, but no substitute, really.\nTuesday 25th May: Lunch the same as the previous day, except with cheese in the sandwich as well. Tea proved my first real challenge, as I wasn’t at home and needed a sandwich or something on-the-go. A cheese pasty seemed a cop-out, as did a fast-food veggie burger. However, the sandwich shops still open in Newcastle has a ridiculous lack of choice for the herbivorous type – Either salad (never good in a sandwich), egg mayonnaise (a substance straight from Satan’s bottom) or coleslaw (what Satan spews after a night chewing Judas Iscariot). WH Smith came to my rescue, however, offering a carrot, hummus and rocket sandwich, which was palatable enough.\nWednesday 26th May: In the lunch sandwich, a veggie Brussels Pate. This was nicely like the real thing, though it might as well have been a gold ingot for its ease of spreading on bread. Tea was a vegetable pie and some fallafel.\nThursday 27th May: Thursday, at work, is the day when the students get sent out for sandwiches. The firm supplying them didn’t have much more on their menu than the sort of nonsense that faced me on Tuesday evening – however, they did have a cheese, tomato and onion panini, which was quite sufficient. For tea, tofu and mushroom rogan josh. Tofu, it seems, is good when marinated and cooked for long enough. I expect I’ll be having more of that in the future.\nFriday 28th May: Due to the rest of the bread I owned having turned blue, I couldn’t really make my own sandwiches for work. The sandwich shop offerings there were woeful to say the least. So it was off to the cafeteria, where I could at least get vegetable pizza and chips. The afternoon heralded a drinking session, wherein I imbibed that fabulous level of alcohol required to make take-away pizza seem like a terribly good idea. Thus it was that a spinach, artichoke and olive pizza entered my possession. Spinach is great on a pizza.\nSaturday 29th May: In the morning, vegetable pie and fallafel again. In the afternoon, braised tofu. Later on, it was off to Wetherspoons. I’ve had the veggie burger and five-bean chilli there before numerous times, so I thought that’d be a cop-out. Therefore, it was the spinach, chickpea and sweet potato curry that took my fancy. Very nice, too. And no sign of the ubiquitous cumin-flavoured grease that often serves as curry sauce in England.\nMonday 31st May: The sharp-eyed will notice that I’ve missed Sunday out. Sunday is usually dinner at the parents’ house, and I was always going to eat whatever they were good enough to put in front of me. Especially as it was lasagne and chips. The rest of the day was veggie, but to make up for this transgression, I stretched the week to eight days. Today, I had a go at making a pasta bake with soya mince. Not with the best results, but it’s the first attempt I’ve has at doing it with any sort of mince. Edible, though (by my standards anyway). And there’s some left over for tea, too.\nSo the conclusions? Well, the only difficulties were in finding decent sandwiches from shops. It’d be interesting to see if this attitude of providing only token veggie options extends also to restaurants and takeaways – something I’ll bear in mind when visiting such places in the future. It’s not difficult to find veggie food in supermarkets or chain stores like Holland & Barratt’s, but if you prefer to shop locally, not quite so easy. So I can see that for a vegetarian, especially in such a place as the north-east (which isn’t always among the first to catch onto cultural trends), it’s not always easy to feed yourself, but it’s possible. Possible, though, isn’t really good enough. But as predicted, I have no plans to become vegetarian, though I do reckon I’ll be having more veggie food in the future.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/content_1.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nThe 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nApples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.\nRuth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nThe Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.\nWashington Redskins – Back to the Present?\nInteresting developments in US sport. The US Patent Office has, as of June 18th 2014, annulled all trademarks of the Washington Redskins NFL team, stating that their name was “disparaging to Native Americans”. This covers all references to “redskins” that they own, including the intersectionality-tastic name of their cheer squad, the Redskinettes.\nThis probably doesn’t come as any surprise, regardless of which side of the fence you take in arguments about political correctness. Indeed, the real surprise to me is that this has taken so long. It’s been a constant source of morbid wonder to me that a team in the 21st century was still allowed to carry such a moniker. We’re all very sensitive these days, and rightly so, about using racial slang, often just in case it’s considered offensive.\nIt seems, though, that there’s been a movement for a name change for some time. It’s interesting to note that numerous polls have been conducted on the issue, often with a majority of Americans not favouring a change. the majority, one assumes, would not be Native American. In polls exlusively among the latter, however, it seems that the name and logo of the Washington Team have long caused upset to Native Americans. That’s something that really shouldn’t be ignored.\nHow the team will react to this, especially with (I assume) no further control over use of their names and logos and therefore their corporate identity, remains to be fully seen. It would interest me, however, if a name change would open the doors to further changes in American sport. You might not consider the Cleveland Indians or Atlanta Braves to be as extreme as this example, but that might not be your choice.\nI’d also be interested to see if this affected the Cleveland Browns – their name being a reference not to one of their early owners, Paul Brown, but to boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed by the white press of the day as “The Brown Bomber” – one of a number of sobriquets applied to him that included “Chocolate Chopper” and “Mahogany Mauler”. Again, you’ll have your own opinion on the acceptability of that case.\nBut it’s ironic that the sport which just drafted it s first openly gay player is still, in parts, stuck in Blazing Saddles-era America. I hope that the Washington franchise responds positively to this, listens to the concerns of the Native American community and thereby shows that American sport can be fully progressive.\nRetrospection\nThe usual end-of-year roundup. And not a bad one.\nJanuary: Performance of The Day after the Fair at The Royalty, directed by little old me. Supremely proud of the production and the response it got.\nFebruary: Saw The Mousetrap. Baffled as to why it’s so famous.\nMarch: Trip to York to see Tara Fitzgerald in The Winter’s Tale. Worth the trip.\nApril: Performed in Proof at The Royalty, playing a Mathematician with mental issues. Worth seeing the film if you can.\nMay: Trip to Manchester for poetry, art and theatre. And real ale and and Hats. That’s like a holy pentanity, or something.\nJune: In the tech box for once, running lights for Deathtrap with Washington Theatre Group.\nJuly: A camping and swimming trip, around the Northumbrian Coast. Swam at Low Newton and Sugar Sands, freezing cold but worth every penny of the wetsuit. Became vice-chair of the Royalty Theatre.\nAugust: A break in the Lake District, firstly staying in Keswick and seeing some of the finest theatre I’ve ever witnessed, at the Theatre by the Lake. This was followed by some camping in Grizedale, now becoming a favourite camping haunt. And some swims in Grasmere and Rydal water, on warm sunny days in beautiful surroundings. Played the Caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland with Washington Theatre Group.\nSeptember: Another North-East Skinny Dip, preceded by an evening swim around the Farne Islands surrounded by seals. Easily the best experience of the year. Also, a trip to Brighton.\nOctober: Playing Lennie in Of Mice and Men at The Royalty; easily the biggest acting challenge I’ve ever had. Still surprised that I got through it.\nNovember: Finish playing Lennie. Suprised I got through it.\nDecember: Crosswords turn 100. Well, it’s a big deal to me.\nApples on Tour – The Lake District\nJust realised I forgot to post this in August. I apologise sincerely to those whose lives have been irretrievably ruined by the transgression, and will undertake to have myself ritually flogged with an electric eel as soon as I can be bothered.\nI’ve been visiting the Lake District regularly (at least once a year) for the past few years now, though only for camping trips to Grizedale, set nicely between Coniston and Windermere in the South Lakes. Last year, the trip was memorable for the wrong reasons – it was abandoned after half of the campsite nearly ended up as part of Morcambe Bay after a downpour that even surprised the local farmer. This year we decided on August instead of June in the hope of better weather, but I’d decided to test the humour of the weather gods by adding a stay in the North Lakes – Keswick, to be precise. I’d been once before, but then only for an afternoon about fourteen years previously – and a town with its own pencil museum cannot be disregarded so lightly.\nThe journey from Sunderland began with the A1 south as an entrée that I’m quite used to by now, nothing spectacular there. The main course of the A66 over the Pennines was still familiar, but much more beautiful as the Backbone of England rose on either side. Once into Cumbria, dessert was sumptuous. Huge green hills and valleys to the left and right; I have to admit that I was keeping somewhat under the speed limit to be able to appreciate it all (while keeping eyes on the road, obviously). Past Penrith and heading toward Keswick, all else seemed dwarfed by Skiddaw and other local peaks. Just before hitting Keswick centre, I stopped at the Castlerigg stone circle – a prehistoric site of the Stonehenge sort, just with smaller stones and no crossbars (which changed prehistoric football forever). But of more interest is the view – mountains all around: Causey Pike, The Catbells, Blencathra, Castlerigg Fell and Helvellyn – the best name of an English mountain ever.\nThat evening saw the first of three trips I’d planned to the Theatre by the Lake – this for See How They Run, a classic farce by Philip King with the standard mistaken identities and fast-paced comings and goings. Plus a bishop who looked a little like Bishop Brennan. A very good production, and a humorous way to begin the holiday.\nWednesday morning saw a trip to the Pencil Museum, Keswick having been the first pencil-producing place on the planet. Small, but perfectly formed, which is more than you could say for the Puzzling Place – a small museum about optical illusions. Probably more for kids, to be fair. The weather put the kibosh on plans to do a bit of walking, but another trip to the theatre later on proved a treat – Vincent in Brixton, a studio play about Van Gogh’s early adulthood in London, has to be one the finest pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen – acting spot on, set perfectly detailed and a captivating story.\nThursday’s weather was a lot better, so I took a trip to Ullswater in the hope of seeing those daffodils of Wordsworth fame – failed there. Maybe the wrong time or the wrong place, but I wandered lonely as a cloud around Glenridding anyway. Stunning views around Ullswater in the bright sunshine. I really need to go back to the lakes at some point and do some proper fell walking. The evening saw a walk around the Derwent close to sunset, before a final trip to the theatre – this time for ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore – a revenge tragedy in the Shakespeare mould, but with more sex and violence. And blood. I’m sure that was a real heart and blood in the final scene, though we’ll assume not human. But effective nonetheless.\nSo, that was three plays in three nights, all excellent productions drawing upon similar casts (six plays to choose from over the week; a good number of their actors appeared in three shows each). If I’m ever back in Keswick, I’ll have to visit again.\nOn Friday I checked out of the hotel, and headed for Grizedale, with some Wordsworth tourism on the way. Grasmere is home to his grave, as well as those of a number of his family, including his noted sister Dorothy. I saw those, and then headed to Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both worth a look if you’re a fan of the poet, or even of Dorothy. Grasmere is also home to Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread shop. I’m no gingerbread connoisseur, but it was fine, fine gingerbread. Then, onto Grizedale to hope for great weather, which the BBC was not promising.\nBut the BBC weather people once again proved as useful as a sundial in Castle Dracula. Saturday was nice and sunny, so it was back off to Grasmere for a swim in the lake. Not too cold – certainly better than the North Sea was the previous month, and made all the better by beautiful mountainous surroundings. An hour’s dip was followed by pub lunch in the Eagle’s Head at Satterthwaite – the game pie there is one of the miracles of the modern world. It was the highlight of our ill-fated trip last year, and was no less wondrous this time around.\nThe downpours forecast by the BBC even stayed away on Sunday, when the weather was even better – only one cloud in the sky, wandering as lonely as Wordsworth. Thus a second swim in Rydal was enjoyed, again with mountains and trees and pastures and other assorted greenery all around. And again, followed by a pub lunch, and finally, the trip home. A wonderful few days spent in what I believe is the most beautiful part of the country.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_free-speech/content_199.html": "Free Speech\nFree Speech – a lovely phrase. A democratic ideal, but perhaps unconsciously to many, one of those concepts that can all too often trigger an “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others” response. Whilst many people will state that they agree with the idea of Free Speech, some of these will nonetheless call for the censorship of extreme views with which they do not approve. Two recent media events have been examples of Free Speech being used as a platform for views with which I certainly do not agree. This, of course, challenged me to consider my opinions on Free Speech.\nThe first of these incidents was Jan Moir’s repugnant Daily Mail article about the nature (or “unnature”, as she might have it), surrounding the death of Stephen Gately. This article, despite the fact that neither police nor coroner have ever suggested anything other than a death from natural causes, blamed his death on his homosexuality. Not in so many words, obviously – but the suggestion was plastered over the article. A massive internet backlash, lead by (among others) Derren Brown, Stephen Fry and a wonderfully scathing article by Charlie Brooker lead to a record number of complaints to the Press Complaints Commission, and withdrawal of advertisments from the Daily Mail‘s website.\nThe second event was Nick Griffin’s appearance on Question Time. The BBC’s decision was criticised by many who considered that it would give the BNP more of a standing as a political party. I do wonder how many of such people would otherwise have defended free speech. In the event, Nick Griffin simply ended up making himself look like the uneducated bigot that many consider him to be – in showing a blatant ignorance of basic history and culture.\nBoth Nick Griffin and Jan Moir have expressed, on a vast public stage, opinions that to me are utterly despicable. But should they still be allowed to make these opinions public?\nHell yes.\nNick Griffin made himself look a fool. Jan Moir may have made a name for herself (I hadn’t previously heard of her), but it’s muddier than a Mississippi Mud Pie that’s fallen in Mud. I’m not sure who stated that “It’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak up and remove all doubt”, but I think that if we let the fools speak, it’s easier for us to recognise who they are. Intellectual evolution, really.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2015_05/content_176.html": "The 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nApples on Tour – Cambridge and East Anglia\nIt’d been a while since I’d attended one of FifteenSquared.net‘s meet-and-greets, and a while since I’d visited Cambridge. My previous two visits had been flying ones, spent mostly in pubs. Granted, I’m not complaining about that, but some extra time to look around what was clearly a beautiful city would have been a bonus. So when I heard that the next gathering of cruciverbalists would be held there, the chance was leapt upon.\nBut with train prices being as hideous as they are, and coach journeys taking around 10 hours to get there via Birmingham, the car was the only viable option. The A1 isn’t the most inspiring drive, especially when you have four hours of it, but at least that could be punctuated by a stop at the Friendly Farmer, just off the junction of the A1 and A17. It’s a cafe and farmshop that I’ve been to before. The breakfasts are a topping hangover cure, though today I availed myself only of a sausage roll. A very nice one, at that. And a few bits and bobs from the shop before I left (looking forward to the Lincolnshire Poacher).\nAn hour or two later I was in my guest house, Tudor Cottage. Four star, and worthy of the rating – even better, £50 a night isn’t bad for Cambridge. Comfortable room with all the things you’d expect – TV, tea & coffee. But it’s the little things that make a difference. Free Wi-Fi offered by hotels or B&Bs is often intermittent, or only works in the lobby, or only works when it’s in the mood. No problems here. The tea choice was very good, too – as well as the usual, there were also others from the Twinings stable, one of mine being salted caramel green tea. Not unpleasant, but I’m not sure I’d consider my life incomplete if I never experience it again. The breakfasts too, were worth it, with plenty of choice on the menu. Proprietors were helpful and friendly, to boot.\nSo the Friday night was left over to a wander around Cambridge. Tea was a fish pie in The Eagle, former haunt of Crick and Watson. Expensive, but enjoyable. Then off to the Cambridge Arts Theatre for A Mad World, My Masters, adapted from the original Thomas Middleton text and set in 1950s Soho. Adapted, that is, by throwing in loads of knob gags and set in Soho by virtue of looking anywhere vaguely iniquitous. Ham acted, but it seemed to have been directed like that, so it was underwhelming to say the least. And that’s the RSC.\nSaturday had more promise. Because of the insistence of some museums and galleries in Cambridge to stay closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, I was going to have to do some of that on the Saturday. Except the God of Laziness had other plans, and so I only had time for a bit of a wander and a cup of tea before heading out to the crossword meet-up. That particular event was to be held at the Castle Inn, an Adnam’s pub with an apparently good reputation for food. A deserved reputation, one would say, from the quality of their Castle Burger. And a fine selection of real ales, too. The beer and crosswordy talk flowed for hours, culminating in a quiz mastered superbly by John Henderson, setter for the Guardian among others.\nI chose to leave after the quiz and venture forth to find some theatre or other entertainment, and found it at the ADC Theatre, in the guise of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams’s verbose but much-acclaimed classic. This was an amateur production by the Combined Actors of Cambridge, and a very well-worked one. The action of the play is mostly carried by three characters – Maggie, Brick and Big Daddy – who all have a scary amount to do and say. And they did it superbly. The technical side of things was equally impressive. Given what I experienced the previous night, I can only reiterate what I’ve said many times before – that often, the difference between amateur and professional theatre is that amateurs simply don’t get paid.\nSunday brought me even more time to mooch about, seeing sights. Which is good, because if I was seeing sounds, or smells, or tastes, I’d be worried. Cambridge is a beatiful place to look at, but one must be careful of just staring at the lovely tops of buildings for too long, lest a stray temporary road sign gets caught under one’s foot and sends them tumbling over. Thankfully, I had my wits about me and just about managed to keep my footing, though passing motorists probably had a chuckle. In the afternoon, I met up with my old friends Steve and Sarah, now residents of Cambridgeshire. Both are fans of the ale, so it was inevitable that our meeting would involve a trip to a local hostelry. About four or five of them in fact. Or six. After a while, it was hard to keep count. But much real ale was enjoyed.\nSomehow I managed to end up where I needed to be for that evening’s entertainment – Kathryn Roberts and Sean Lakeman at Cambridge Junction. I’ve seen Sean’s brother Seth a few times; they’re from a Cornish musical family who have a great line in folk music and have always been very much worth watching (and crucially for musicians, worth listening to). This was no exception, despite being a smaller-scale concert than Seth’s shows – but where folk music’s concerned, scale is hardly a major factor. Hattie Briggs, the support act, put on a fine show, too.\nMonday morning saw me leave the guest house and head back up north – but not before some further tourism. It’s a lesson I should have learnt a long time ago,but checking when museums are actually open is not my strong point, so I left Huntingdon having more experience of the local pie shop than the Cromwell Museum. So I wouldn’t say my time there was wasted. From there I headed to Peterborough, hoping to see their museum. Before that, however, I chose to have a look at their cathedral, knowing nothing of it. A beautiful building, as one expects from cathedrals, but I wasn’t expecting to see the grave of Catherine of Aragon, bearing the pomegranates (her symbol) put there by well-wishers. I’m no Monarchist, but to see the grave of someone of such importance to England’s history was moving.\nAfter finding that Peterborough’s museum was also closed, Lincoln was the next stop. Steve and Sarah had given me tips – a whisk(e)y shop and a cheese shop were among its attractions. Hence the Cheese Society and the Lincoln Whisky Shop both got a little extra custom that day. I had a brief look at the castle, whose modernisation in parts made it feel tacky, and also at the cathedral, who wanted £12 for me to look at it. It didn’t get it. The Usher Gallery at The Collection was the first chance I’d had to visit a gallery all weekend, and despite being fairly small, didn’t disappoint.\nBut that was it for me, and soon I was back on the A1 after a memorable weekend.",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_08_13_desert-island-horror-movies/content_79.html": "Desert Island Horror Movies\nI doubt I could really do this sort of thing for all movies, as there are just too many I wouldn’t fancy leaving out. So I thought I’d just do horror movies this time – my favourite film genre, and it leaves it open for me to work on another genre when ideas for the Desert-Islandy things begin to dry up.\nBut the seasoned film buff may sense a problem here, and that’s the openness to interpretation that the term “horror movie” attracts. Father Dougal, we must recall, found “a Volkswagen with a mind of its own” to be the stuff of nightmares, after all. However, here you’re just going to have to make do with what I decide is a horror movie. Let’s face it, it’s an unlikely enough scenario that I’d suddenly have to grab ten of my favourite horrors before being cast away on a desert island that presumably has a fully-working home cinema system and power supply, without having to add the notion of a customs official testing each film against a list of pre-ordained criteria. Let’s just leave reality out of this, okay?\nSo here we go, in no particular order (until the top three). Unlike my last couple of these things, no reserves, just a top ten.\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\nThere aren’t too many American movies that are at least partially set in the Yorkshire Moors, which really helps this one. You’ve got the classic dumb American teenagers who stumble into the Slaughtered Lamb pub (a great name if ever there was one), full of not entirely welcoming people who suddenly become bad at darts. But the intrepid young explorers are at least told to stay on the roads. That’s the last thing they do, obviously, and it’s not long before they both become a midnight snack for some hideous toothy beast. One of them dies, the other ends up having a fling with Jenny Agutter, which is a good recommendation for lycanthropic savagery in anybody’s book. However, he soon realises that he’s become a werewolf, and we’re treated to one of the better werewolf change scenes that cinema has produced. The film ends with his alter-ego going on the rampage in central London, where surprisingly, people actually notice, and the Met police actually try to do something about it. Look out for a young Rik Mayall playing chess in the pub scene at the beginning.\nTheatre of Blood (1973)\nIf you like your horror colourful, melodramatic and with Vincent Price in, look no further. Our Vinnie, the chap who gave us the creepy voice in Michael Jackson’s Thriller, plays Edward Lionheart, a has-been Shakespearean actor who has faked his own death, and plots revenge on the local critics’ circle who have not looked favourably upon his work. And the best part – he kills them all in the manner of Shakespearean deaths. There are lovely gory moments, like the surgical beheading of Captain Mainwairing, and the realisation of what’s happened to those poor, innocent poodles. Being melodrama, it’s camp and over the top, but knowingly so, which makes everything all right. Diana Dors is in it too, which helps any film. A must for any actor who has ever felt that they’d fancy shuffling a critic off their mortal coil. So a must for any actor.\nFrankenstein (1931)\nWe’re talking James Whale’s version here, from 1931. This is the film that gave us the iconic imagery we always associate with Frankenstein – The lumbering, square-headed creature with bolts in his neck that turned Boris Karloff into a movie legend, the electronic lab equipment and Colin Clive’s manic screams of “It’s Aliiiiiive!” on realising that his creature was aliiiiiive. Karloff is brilliant as the docile creature, though, and you can’t help but feel sorry for him – even after the very controversial scene with the girl and the flower, which even today you can’t watch without feeling some sense of utter dread. The sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is almost as good, and even has Katie Nana out of Mary Poppins as the creature’s intended. Odd that those are the two roles she’s best known for. Like many of Universal’s 1930s flagship horrors, it spawned numerous other sequels that weren’t nearly as good, but always either referred to a relative of the monster (“Aunt of Dracula!”) or some unlikely combo (“The Invisible Man Meets Frankenstein Meets The Wolfgirl!”). Best watched drunk, those ones.\nCarry on Screaming (1966)\nOkay, fair enough. Not really a horror. But I’m on a desert island, and some comedy now and then would be welcome, what with all the horror stuff I’ve brought along. This just about fits the bill as horror – It’s a spoof mostly of Hammer movies, but with nods to Universal horrors and one or two others. Here the villains – Kenneth Williams and (swoon) Fenella Fielding, are running a beastly operation to turn pretty young girls into mannequins, before selling them off to shops. The girls are abducted by Oddbodd – a boiler-suited half-Frankenstein’s-Monster-half-werewolf halfwit, whose body parts can regenerate with an electrical charge. Inspector Sidney Bung takes on the case of the missing women with his foolish sidekick, Slowbottom. It’s full of the usual Carry On stuff – pretty ladies, lusty fellas, innuendo and silly jokes. Oddly, no Sid James in this one, but Harry H. Corbett makes up for it in the role of the downtrodden Bung.\nThe Omen (1976)\nBoth The Omen and The Exorcist were gamechangers in the horror world when they came out, being set in the modern day, with spooky music, and having an element of Satanism within. Excuse me for a moment while I shoot myself in the face for having used the word “gamechangers”.\nOkay, done. Boy, did that hurt. Anyway – The Spawn of Satan is born, and some fool does the old switcheroo with the Prince of Darkness and a US diplomat’s kid. You initially wonder how anyone would notice, but it soon becomes strikingly obvious that he’s a bit odd – when he goes to church, he screams. When he visits the zoo, the monkeys scream. When he has a birthday party, his nanny hangs herself. Gregory Peck, the diplomat in question, realises something is wrong (you don’t say), and investigates it with the help of a photographer. In truth, this movie is best remembered (by me at any rate), for the crazy death scenes that fans of the Final Destination series should enjoy. There’s a priest impaled by a church lightning rod, and the photographer is decapitated by a pane of glass. Gritty and gory in a way that Hammer or Universal would never have dared. The 2006 remake had its charms, but this original will always stand out.\nThe Wolfman (1941)\nOften considered by the first werewolf film by people who’ve never seen the earlier Werewolf of London, this Universal horror from the early forties is the more famous of the two, and features Lon Chaney Jr. as the transmogrifying terror. He plays Larry Talbot who, thanks to a gypsy curse – one of those gypsies being Bela Lugosi – becomes very hairy and toothy, with a taste for liking his steaks very rare, at a full moon. Like any good werewolf flick, at first he doesn’t realise it’s him committing all the weird murders going on – making the goodie also the baddie, and making film students wonder just how they analyse the conflicts between protagonist and antagonist. The film also stars Claude Rains of The Invisible Man fame, making it one of the early horror ensemble casts.\nThe Nanny (1965)\nOkay, so this doesn’t sound like a horror, especially as Bette Davis is the title character. But it’s one of the most interesting Hammer movies about – perhaps because it doesn’t look at all like Hammer. In fact, had I not known it was a Hammer, I’d have thought it was Hitchcock. Possibly more suspense/thriller than horror, then, but it seems to deserve inclusion here.\nWe begin with a young boy being taken back home after a stay in some sort of institution for kids with behavioural problems. We don’t know quite what these were, but it’s clear that there’s some serious animosity toward the family’s nanny from the boy. He considers her evil. He’s considered a troublemaker. We don’t know quite what to believe. But as the film’s plot opens up, we begin to see why the tension’s there. We slowly discover who IS the malign influence. In some quite shocking detail, for a film of that age (and in black and white). A cinematic gem, but an unfortunately little-known one.\nBut now, we come to the top three. I’ve found it too difficult to rank these three, so I won’t put them in any sort of order. Oddly enough, they all star Christopher Lee. Which is only right.\nSleepy Hollow (1999)\nIt’s Tim Burton. And it stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lee. Plus Uncle Monty, Emperor Palpatine, Dumbledore (v2.0), Alfred the Butler (v2.0), Queenie from Blackadder, Winona Ryder’s dad out of Beetlejuice, Darth Maul and the guy out of Pulp Fiction who kept the watch up his arse. And more. How’s that for a cast?\nIt’s a looser-than-loose interpretation of Washington Irving’s story, putting Depp’s Ichabod Crane in the role of a detective sent to investigate some beheadings in upstate New York. Crane is a man of science, and disbelieves stories of ghosts and a Headless Horseman. But after he finds a strange tree that can only be a Tim Burton creation, and sees the horseman appear, he has other ideas. All this while he’s falling in love with Christina Ricci (who wouldn’t?) and she’s falling in love with him (who wouldn’t?), and the townsfolk are losing patience with him, as one or two others lose their heads, literally. And it’s filmed with a slightly blue tinge to give it even more of a gloomy, macabre look. It basically has everything – great cast, great direction, great script, and a big spider.\nDracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)\nYou’ve got to love Christopher Lee for this movie, not just because he’s the definitive Count (sorry, Bela), but also because he steadfastly refused to say any of the lines given to him – as he thought Bram Stoker would never have written them. It’s Christopher Lee’s second Hammer Dracula, and bears all of the hallmarks of the studio – filmed in that rich, saturated Eastman colour, with Bernard Robinson’s grand, lush sets and James Bernard’s cracking score. The plot is also very typical – four travellers in Transylvania end up at the mysterious castle that the locals (all from the West Country, it seems) refuse to acknowledge. It is, of course, Old Pointy Tooth’s castle, and when they’ve been told they can stay for dinner, they’re clearly misreading the signals. One throat-slitting and smoky transformation later, Drac’s out of his coffin and ready to sink his fangs into Barbara Shelley – you can’t dispute the man’s taste. But one fellow gets away and brings back a priest to sort out Dracula once and for all, at least until the next sequel that Hammer did. To my mind, it’s the best film Hammer ever did – and if you presume yourself to be a fan of Hammer, and haven’t seen it, then you can get out of my blog right now, thank you.\nThe Wicker Man (1973)\nOften considered the best British horror film, The Wicker Man is certainly different in horror terms. Nothing supernatural, a soundtrack of folk music, and religious ideology that’s more about pleasing the old gods than summoning Satan. Rowan Morrison has apparently gone missing from the Scottish island of Summerisle, and Edward Woodward is the copper sent from the mainland to find her. But what he finds is the locals denying her very existence, despite everything pointing to the fact that she does, or has existed. His inner Christian is further enraged by the pagan rituals, often involving sex or nudity, that prevail on the island. The seemingly affable Lord Summerisle, a part written for Christopher Lee, allows him the wherewithal to continue his investigations, but…no, I’m not going to spoil it. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee are excellent, and we have Ingrid Pitt (mmmmm) and Britt Ekland (mmmmm) too. The music is beautiful, being all folky and appearing out of place in such a sinister plot. And that final scene is just frabjous – The Wicker Man in full glory, the setting sun, and the Summerisle citizens singing joyously.\nAnd if, before reading this, you thought I was on about a Nicholas Cage film of the same name, get the Hell out of my internet.\nDesert Island Horror Movies | ChristianBookBarn.com said,\nAugust 13, 2013 at 12:27 pm\n[…] Recommended Article FROM https://oddbodd13.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/desert-island-horror-movies/ […]",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2013_07_23_flipping-genders/content_236.html": "Flipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nHave your say!",

And not a bad one.\nJanuary: Performance of The Day after the Fair at The Royalty, directed by little old me. Supremely proud of the production and the response it got.\nFebruary: Saw The Mousetrap. Baffled as to why it’s so famous.\nMarch: Trip to York to see Tara Fitzgerald in The Winter’s Tale. Worth the trip.\nApril: Performed in Proof at The Royalty, playing a Mathematician with mental issues. Worth seeing the film if you can.\nMay: Trip to Manchester for poetry, art and theatre. And real ale and and Hats. That’s like a holy pentanity, or something.\nJune: In the tech box for once, running lights for Deathtrap with Washington Theatre Group.\nJuly: A camping and swimming trip, around the Northumbrian Coast. Swam at Low Newton and Sugar Sands, freezing cold but worth every penny of the wetsuit. Became vice-chair of the Royalty Theatre.\nAugust: A break in the Lake District, firstly staying in Keswick and seeing some of the finest theatre I’ve ever witnessed, at the Theatre by the Lake. This was followed by some camping in Grizedale, now becoming a favourite camping haunt. And some swims in Grasmere and Rydal water, on warm sunny days in beautiful surroundings. Played the Caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland with Washington Theatre Group.\nSeptember: Another North-East Skinny Dip, preceded by an evening swim around the Farne Islands surrounded by seals. Easily the best experience of the year. Also, a trip to Brighton.\nOctober: Playing Lennie in Of Mice and Men at The Royalty; easily the biggest acting challenge I’ve ever had. Still surprised that I got through it.\nNovember: Finish playing Lennie. Suprised I got through it.\nDecember: Crosswords turn 100. Well, it’s a big deal to me.\nRetrospection\nNo plays performed in front of major international stars this year, but you can’t have everything. Still, a lot of good stuff to look back upon.\nJanuary: Back to panto action, with the Washington Theatre Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.\nFebruary: Trip to Liverpool for the Green Party conference and some tourism.\nMarch: About forty different birthday booze-ups for Nigel’s 40th. Seemed like that anyway.\nApril: Performed in a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker. Took a trip into Darkest Yorkshire, too – somehow returning with a lot of beer.\nMay: Trip to London for a birthday. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that cake. I think I winced when the knife went in. Any man would. That should give you an idea of what shape it was.\nJune: Attempted a weekend break in Grizedale, but rain contrived to have half the campsite flooded. Despite this, a memorable trip if only for that wonderful game pie at the Eagle’s Head – the highlight of the 13-hour holiday. Performed this poem at the launch event for the Middlesbrough Literary Festival.\nJuly: A second camping trip, this time around the Northumbrian Coast, proved more successful. Great weather all over the place, and the fish and chips from Beadnell Bay are highly recommended.\nAugust: Took part in an anti-NF demo in Sunderland. The star of the NF show was the guy in the Chelsea shirt with “Essien” on the back. Michael Essien, a black foreigner, an immigrant with a job. Love the logic there.\nSeptember: Highlight of the year: The North-East Skinny Dip. Yes, jumping in the North Sea at 7 in the morning is the best thing that happened to me this year. Believe it or else. Flag bearer at Sunderland Pride, too. And interviewed by the same Sky reporter and both events.\nOctober: Unexpectedly found myself performing in The Edge of Darkness at The Royalty after an actor had to drop out due to illness on the final night. Scary experience, and an ironic one – I’m the smartarse who always knows his lines first, and I had to do the entire performance with a script.\nNovember: Started archery lessons with Whitburn Archers.\nDecember: Directing The Day after the Fair. Coming to a theatre near you soon. If you’re near The Royalty.\nRoll on 2013.\nRetrospection\nIt’s been a hell of a year, if I’m honest. There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nRetrospection\nSo, farewell then, 2010, as E. J. Thribb might say. The year has been good fun, with mostly plus points. So for those who might be interested, here’s my 2010 summed up,\nJanuary: As per the previous two years, January was pantomime month with the Washington Theatre Group. This year saw me playing the downtrodden Blue Peter in Peter Pan: The Revenge of Hook.\nFebruary: Thought I’d give ballet a try (watching, not doing), in the shape of The Nutcracker, full of music I already thought wonderful. And I’d definitely see some again.\nMarch: A trip to the South coast to see the Tiger Lillies in Brighton with Billie and Jen. I must visit Brighton again one day.\nApril: A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies in a recorded showing of Shockheaded Peter at The V&A. The Lillies also made a trip to Durham, so I could see them without having to travel more than 20 miles.\nMay: Joined the Green Party, shortly after Caroline Lucas became their first MP. Tried vegetarianism for a week.\nJune: ROCKY HORROR! And Nigel actually remembers this one. Will wonders never cease?\nJuly: Welcome to the Jungle with the WTG, playing a couch potato and a doberman (“Strong, naturally dominant, fanatically loyal, and of course, highly intelligent” – just like me, then). One of the plays was also my inaugural attempt at directing. I’ve never been so nervous in the theatre as when that play was first performed.\nAugust: Much hilarity as a scorpion is found at the Arts Centre Washington and the place is closed for two days. Oh, for those halcyon days in Botswana when even a kid getting stung by a scorpion wouldn’t have the school closed for five minutes.\nSeptember: Plenty of theatre this month: Apples, Hairspray, The King & I and Blithe Spirit.\nOctober: Failed a driving test, but passed a stand-up comedy test after doing a turn for the Sunderland Green Party. Hopefully, it won’t be a the last.\nNovember: Performing at the Royalty in Journey’s End – great fun to do, and the moustache will live on in legend.\nDecember: Begun rehearsals of Macbeth at the Royalty, in some small but fun parts.\nBring on 2011.\nRetrospection\nMore an excuse to make a post than anything else, really. A quick review of the fun stuff this year.\nJanuary: Snow White and the Magic Mirror with the Washington Theatre Group. I still think I owe some revenge upon who thought up the final night trick they played on me.\nFebruary: Not fun. Moving swiftly on…\nMarch: The renewal of an old acquaintance that would have an effect on my thoughts on politics, my confidence, and led to a greater appreciation of poetry and music from a participative perspective. Say that twenty times fast.\nApril: Three birthday parties.\nMay: London, Manchester, Sunderland, London and Harrogate were where I spent Saturday nights – Enjoying the Tiger Lillies, Rebecca Newman, The Fab Café and Breathing Corpses at the Royalty.\nJune: Playing four parts in The Graduate at the Royalty.\nJuly: Visits to the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery.\nAugust: Hanging around South London for a change. And a first full weekend at the Edinburgh Fringe.\nSeptember: Manchester weekend of pink and blackness.\nOctober: Grized Ale, a lovely Lake District beer. A weekend in the Lake District, with no lakes. But that didn’t spoil it. And, a paid acting job. Thirty whole quid.\nNovember: The month of the housewarming party, of which there were two. And I had to go and resort to gin, didn’t I?\nDecember: First niece, Eloise Jennifer, born. A fifth London trip, and one to York. And, I think, a first completion of an Araucaria crossword.\nGood year, all told.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_las-malvinas/content_157.html": "Las Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_language/content_20.html": "To Think upon Thy Words\nFree speech is an inalienable human right. But it is not a duty. We have the right to say what we want, but it is always worth remembering that we can choose to use speech responsibly. Sometimes it might be more expedient to say nothing in a given situation; in others, it might be wise for us to choose our words correctly – particularly if we risk offending people.\nThis is known variously as tact, diplomacy, or political correctness. The latter is a phrase that we often love to complain about, when we hear about some jobsworth who has banned something for fear of insulting someone who probably doesn’t care. These are extreme examples, but political correctness is something that a lot of people take seriously, becuase they’re consciencious enough people to not wish to offend people. So I’m not about to talk about political correctness gone mad, more political correctness in its more sane form.\nBut it’s a minefield, this PC lark. It’s difficult to know what will offend other people. Even, it seems, when a term seems perfectly serviceable. As I found out this week, and the purpose of this post is to explore such a problem.\nIn a crossword yesterday, the word “handicapped” was used. It was a golfing reference, but the clue using it attempted to misdirect the solver by suggesting it to be a reference to disability. In the discussion that followed on a crossword blog, it was noted that “handicapped” is considered to be an offensive term.\nThat surprised me. A quick consultation of the Delphic Oracle (Chambers Dictionary) makes no mention of the word being offensive or vulgar. Among its definitions are “Any physical, mental or social disability”. That’s how I’d always seen the word in that sense, and the definition doesn’t point toward any intent to offend.\nBut then I was presented with this link to a BBC poll to find words considered offensive by the disabled community. In short, here are the top ten:\n1. Retard\n2. Spastic\n3. Window-licker\n4. Mong\n5. Special\n6. Brave\n7. Cripple\n8. Psycho\n9. Handicapped\n10. Wheelchair-bound\nNow, the inclusion of some of these is perfectly understandable. 3, 4, and 8 are phrases that, as far as I know, have never been part of medical parlance and have only ever been used offensively. 1, 2 and 7 probably have been medical terms in the past, but due to increased use as offensive terms, have become almost exclusively that. And it’s easy to see how 5 and 6 could be considered patronising.\nHowever, I don’t think that I’ve ever heard 9 or 10 to be used offensively. They seem to be phrases that correctly describe a situation. No more or less than “disabled” does. But, according to the BBC poll, it’s more about perceived connotations to the word – “handicapped”, although semantically no different to “disabled”, appears to have greater stigma attached to it. Some see “handicapped” as offensive as “nigger” – even though the latter has never had a valid, unoffensive, non-pejorative sense.\nSo this causes a problem for the person who wants to be PC. If a phrase is semantically accurate, should we allow ourselves to be bound by a stigma that might only be seen by certain people, or should we feel free to use such a term? If another person, for whatever reason, thinks that such an accurate term has connotations they don’t like, it is our problem? After all, we can’t assume that ALL people will have the same perceptions. In discussion of the crossword clue, one disabled man was happy to refer to himself as handicapped, and didn’t mind if others followed suit. Nor did he care much for disabled people who disliked the word. He felt the word was a correct description of his situation.\nI think that the answer for a PC-wannabe is simple. If you want to remain unoffensive, at least try to keep the tone of what you say unoffensive. That way, even if a word creeps into your discourse that you didn’t realise had any stigma attached, it’s easier to see that no offence has been intended. If you are aware of that a phrase might raise eyebrows, it has to be up to your own judgement, based upon the conext, the intent and the target audience. In principle, I see no problem with using a valid word that precisely defines something. But you might. And to force a rule in this situation would be Linguistic Nazism, and I’ll have to truck with that.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_page_4/content_202.html": "Desert Island Books\nSo, you’re probably familiar with Desert Island Discs. If not, take a moment to Wikipedia it, if you’re happy to have that term as a verb. This is a slight variation, with books instead. Why? Because I can, so there. There is, admittedly, an obvious problem with the concept, in that I’d have to know in advance that I’d be castaway on a desert island, to give me time to pack – in which case I’d probably want to spend less time fannying around in Waterstones and a bit more trying to get out of whatever crazy situation I’d landed myself in. But hey, if I wanted such realistic analysis of clearly never-gonna-happen situations, I’d go see a superhero movie with Nigel.\nAnyway, This isn’t gonna be my top ten books. Because I’ll be on a desert island, and presumably eating only coconuts and bananas and with only sea to look at, I’m going to want some variety from my literature. I’m leaving out Shakespeare, as there are so many of them; likewise poetry books and plays. I’m also leaving out my top 7 political books, as I’m saving them for another blog – so those of you who don’t care for my rambling about the stupidity of theocracy in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 won’t have to put up with it. These are books that I’ve read and enjoyed, often on numerous occasions (it is rare that I bother to read a book more than once). Many are not too well known, but all are worth sharing with the world at large.\nI present them in no particular order, and I’ll leave a comment when the book that I’m sure to have shockingly left out springs to mind.\nDracula – Bram Stoker\nAn obvious one to begin with, if you know me well. A gothic horror classic that’s been filmed numerous times, though never in a manner that’s ever stood up to the book, in my humble opinion. It’s written as a series of documents (an epistolary novel as the bookworms term it), mostly journal entries with the odd newspaper report or letter for good measure, that have been compiled by the goodies during their pursuit of the toothy terror. As such, you get a better view of each character’s thoughts and feelings than a straightforward 3rd-person-style narrative would give. Stoker’s descriptions are great, especially if your mind’s eye has cast Christopher Lee in the title role. Bela Lugosi would be at least as good, of course, but please – no Frank Langella. A good spooky book for those long winter nightmares.\nFaust Among Equals – Tom Holt\nTom Holt’s comic fantasies usually take the form of a well-known myth or legend, given a humorous twist. This, the first book of his that I read, takes the Faust of Marlowe and Goethe and turns him into the Most Wanted Man in History, having escaped from Hell (just after its management buy-out), causing plenty of mayhem along the way. Once reunited with his old flame Helen of Troy, he has to deal with bounty hunter Kurt “Mad Dog” Lundqvist and Hell’s new management team, who’ve sent their three most stupid spectral warriors after him. I can read this book time and again, just as I can this next book…\nFlying Dutch – Tom Holt\nThis time, our author treats us to a reworking of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman – the original, of course, tells of a Dutch sea-captain, Vanderdecker, whose blasphemy condemns him to sail around the Cape of Good Hope for eternity, being allowed shore leave for a month every seven years, so that he can try to find a woman who’ll love him until death – when the curse will be broken. Holt, however, gives us a Vanderdecker who’s forced into his life at sea for another reason – his crew have drunk some strange elixir which has given them immortality, but has also made them stink to high Heaven. Vanderdecker’s energies are spent trying to find a cure. And that’s what some people are afraid of, particularly the National Lombard Bank, who underwrote his life insurance policy – which there isn’t enough money in the world to cover. This one’s probably my favourite of the two Holt books here, and contains one of my favourite literary quotes – “An over-excited accountant, like the University of Hull, is a contradiction in terms.”\nVisions of Sugar Plums – Janet Evanovich\nEvanovich’s series of books involving hapless bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have long amused me, and among the series are a few holiday specials, this being one of them. It’s the physical copy I have of this book that puts it on the list, rather than it being any better than others in the series (it’s probably somewhere in the middle, even if you allow for Santa Claus being one of the characters). The reason why is this: shortly after discovering the Stephanie Plum books, I entered a competition on Janet Evanovich’s website. I didn’t win, but hey ho. Then one morning, later in the year, I received a parcel. From Canada. Worried as to exactly what I’d bought on Ebay in a drunken haze this time, I opened it and found a hardback copy of the book here discussed. I hadn’t remembered ordering it, so was a bit confused, but opened it and began to flick through – whereupon I noticed that book had been signed by Janet, to me. And sent at her own expense from North America. Which I have always thought a damn fine gesture. It would therefore have to come with me to a desert island.\nWeaveworld – Clive Barker\nStephen King confesses that Barker’s work leaves him tongue-tied, such is his talent, and it’s easy to see why. This book could probably loosely fit into the horror genre (Barker gave us The Candyman and Hellraiser), but there’s a good deal more to it than that – we can broadly call it fantasy horror with touch of myth. Our hero is Calhoun Mooney, who discovers a strange world referred to as The Fugue, woven into a carpet. This is the domain of the Seerkind, who have hidden themselves there away from an evil force known as the Scourge. Calhoun discovers this when the rug’s owner, one of the Seerkind, dies, and the rug is then sought by the evil Seerkind exile Immacolata and her two ghostly sisters. The plot isn’t important, though – what’s special about this book is that Clive Barker is a master of description and imagination, giving the mind’s eye a lot to play with and your brain a lot to think about. The novel begins with the simple line “Nothing ever begins.” I’ve always thought that a great way to start a book.\nThe Best of Eagle – Marcus Morris, Frank Hampson et al\nAnyone remember the Eagle comics, either in their 50s incarnation or their more recent 80s revival? The latter was contemporary for me, but the former I only really know from this book. Not an Eagle annual, more a compilation of strips and features with their own discrete sections in the book, a bit like a massive version of the comic. I first got hold of a copy from my dad when I was about five, and this book goes into the list as the nostalgia entry. We have Dan Dare and his Northern cohort Digby, bravely fighting tyrannical Venusian short-arse the Mekon. We have PC49, Riders of the Range, Luck of the Legion, Mark Question (the boy with a future – but no past!), the famous Eagle Cutaways, Harris Tweed, retellings of historical events, and numerous educational bits with a glorious yesteryear feel to them (Dribble a ball like Stanley Matthews! Discover what radar is! Tobogganing for Dummies!). I have a different copy these days, but the nostalgia’s still there, even in the terrible binding that makes the pages fall out. Bliss.\nThe Snake – John Godey\nJohn Godey is better known for The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, but this 1978 (I think) work of his is good, solid, escapist pulp fiction. I first encountered it in a Reader’s Digest condensed book back in the 80s, but later found a copy of the full book in a charity shop, since when it’s become a favourite re-read. A literary creature feature, I think it’s up there with the likes of Jaws and Arachnophobia. The plot is nicely high-concept. Some fool of a sailor gets rat-arsed and buys a black mamba (in a big sealed box) from a guy in a bar, like you do. Walking through Central Park at night, he gets mugged and his quarry is let loose, killing the mugger. Central Park is a big place, and the heatwave is making people, and the snake, want to spend a lot of time there. As the death toll slowly rises, we have the usual pack of dimwitted policeman and dignitaries who think they know best, the herpetologist guy who actually does, but no-one listens to (until it’s almost too late), the token woman he falls in love with, and a crazy cult who think the snake is Satan. Yes, it’s all cliché, but it’s bloody good fun. I’d love a film to be made of this, thought most would probably see it as being too close to Jaws. Problem? what problem?\nThe A-Z of Almost Everything – Trevor Montague\nBecause I’m one of those people who can sit and read books of lists and facts for hours on end. And this is full of ’em.\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Arthur Conan Doyle\nHolmes rocks. There are 56 short stories and four novels in the canon, and this, I think, is the best of them. It’s darker and spookier than most Holmes stories, but his characteristic eccentricities and his amazing powers of deduction are as sharp as ever. Here Holmes is on the trail of a huge, ghostly hound that is terrifying a Dartmoor village, having already killed Sir Charles Baskerville. Which is a pretty cool name, if you’ll allow some slight digression. There’s also an escaped murderer on the loose, to add to the complications. Holmes isn’t fazed, though. He wouldn’t be Holmes if he was. Like Dracula, another good ‘un for the dark nights.\nAlice in Sunderland – Bryan Talbot\nThis is about the best history book one could have. It’s a huge graphic novel that serves as a history of both Sunderland and Lewis Carroll, the latter having been a clergyman in the former. Bryan Talbot is a Sunderland resident born in Wigan, and he explores the history of the town/city via a character serving as a narrator. Intertwined with this is biography of the life of Lewis Carroll, including his friendship with Alice Liddel – the Sunderland lass who was the basis of his most famous work. We also get snippets of the history of comics and graphic novels, and all in numerous styles of comic art. I had lived in Sunderland, on and off, for about 8 or 9 years when this book came out. It taught me so much about Sunderland that I probably would never have found out otherwise – sights that there are to see, historical events that have had national or international impact, and many notable people connected with Sunderland. Although not born in Sunderland, it’s a large part of my identity, so knowing what affects that identity has proven very interesting indeed.\nVurt – Jeff Noon\nJeff Noon has one crazy imagination, but he has definitely used it for the powers of good. This was the first book of his I encountered, and probably fits best into the Cyberpunk genre. In futuristic Manchester (from whence Noon hails) there is a bizarre new drug – Vurt feathers. These have hallucinogenic (sometimes akin to virtual reality) effects that differ as to their colours, allowing users different experiences from each (pink feathers, for instance, are porno-vurts). Black is the really dangerous one, and Curious Yellow is the legendary one that Scribble seeks. Scribble has lost his sister to the Vurt world, a parallel dimension hidden in the feathers – when a person is lost to this world, they’re replaced by a being from it – adding to a world where people can already interbreed with shadows, robots and dogs. Yes, it’s weird, but it doesn’t half make for good fiction. A number of his other books are set in the same fictional universe, and make the experience of reading him even better.\nThe Witches – Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl has not been labelled “The Master of the Macabre” for nothing. His Tales of the Unexpected for adults are a joy, though his children’s books often have a grim edge that so many children’s authors forget that kids will lap up. The Witches is the finest example of this. A young boy, living with his grandmother after his parents have died in a car crash, is told by his grandmother of witches – what nasty creatures they are, how to spot them, and their hatred of children. On a holiday to Bournemouth, our hero unwittingly finds himself in the middle of a sinister convention of witches, lead by the Grand High Witch. This loathsome individual then discloses a plan to have all children in England terminated. It’s up to him and his grandmother to stop them. The book frightens, disgusts and amuses in good measure – which is what makes it a cut above most other kid’s books.\nThe Ode Less Travelled – Stephen Fry\nFew books of an educational nature are genuinely entertaining and engaging – most from this genre are dry and academic, which I think will only serve to bore the reader – meaning that they have less will to keep learning. The Dummies books go some way to redressing the balance, but funny as they are, they don’t always get the educational side right. This book by Stephen Fry, on poetry, manages to get both aspects just right. The book is for those wanting to know more about how to write, or simply appreciate, poetry. It goes into metre, rhyme and form, giving countless examples from the old masters. There are exercises that allow the reader to practice what has been taught (some of which have led me to write some fairly good poetry, such as The Zombie King). All of this is presented in Stephen Fry’s inimitable style, being humorous and intelligent in equal measure. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in writing poetry.\nThe Bell Jar – Sylvia Plath\nI know I’m now well past the 8 choices that Desert Island Discs allows, but it’s my right as an Englishman to carry on if I wish, so I will. The Bell Jar is Sylvia Plath’s only published novel, published not long before her suicide. Plath’s mental health problems are well-known, as is the fact that this novel is semi-autobiographical. The protagonist is Esther Greenwood, a young woman of mid-20th century middle-class America, clearly an analogue of Plath herself. We see the ups and downs of Esther’s life as she struggles with the society into which she was born, and the mental health struggles that arise because of that. The knowledge that it’s based upon Plath’s life tinges it with sadness, but there are some moments that bring a smile – her exquisite poetic voice shines through in many of the descriptions, and there’s often a wonderful child-like innocence to the way Esther speaks. It’s not a book to keep you upbeat, but is a worthy read to get a view of mental health from the point of view of somebody who has been through the mill in that respect.\nSo that’s fourteen books if I’ve counted right, from the sublime to the ridiculous and everything pretty much in between. I hope at least one appeals to you and gives you some brief chance of escapism in this increasingly discombobulated world of ours.\nApples on Tour – Todmorden et al.\nI’d never heard of Todmorden until it was announced that one of fifteensquared.net‘s Sloggers and Betters events was going to be held there. It’s right on the western edge of West Yorkshire, in spitting distance of Rochdale. If you’re a very good spitter and have a fair wind in your favour, of course. Despite its proximity to such urban centres as Halifax, Burnley and Rochdale, though, it’s nicely set in the middle of the country. Not quite the Dales, not quite the Peak District, but somewhere in the middle. One the first day, you could tell I was near Lancashire, as it was pissing down (which began exactly as I hit the M62, I kid thee not). I chose a lovely B&B a couple miles south of Todmorden, called Birk’s Clough. Brilliant view of the hills and a river from the window, and an even better one from the front gate. The journey there, would, of course, have been much more pleasant had it not been for the rain, but once you’re off the motorways it’s all nice and rural with hills all over the place, as any good jaunt around northern England has. Loads of nice little picturesque towns to pass through on the way here, as well. I thought only the US had towns with names like Friendly, but hats off to Yorkshire for that one. And I have to give kudos to Hebden Bridge for having a cycle shop named Blazing Saddles. Shortly after passing through this town, there’s a great view of Stoodley Pike monument if you’re in the right car seat to see it.\nBecause of the rain, there wan’t much to do in the afternoon aside from sit in and watch Countdown. The rain had subsided by the time it ended, so I set off for a walk about the town to see what hidden gems Todmorden had to offer. The first was interesting – a blue plaque denoting the former house of Sir John Cockroft, one of the two men who first split the atom by artificial means. And then I found a real gem – Bear Arts Brewery, a brewery, beer shop and nude art gallery in one. Now, before all you horny types start programming your sat-navs, the nude art is all very modern-arty, so you might be disappointed. Of course, it would have been wrong for me to have not bought some beer from them after looking about the place, so a six-bottle assortment made its merry way back to the B&B with me. The town also has a nice cosy second-hand bookshop, one of those that’s so packed that only one person can be in any one aisle at a time. Next to that is a toy store and museum, sadly not open when I visited. To my lasting regret, a shop advertising itself as an old-fashioned sweet shop appeared to have gone to retail heaven some time ago.\nThe evening took me to Hebden Bridge Little Theatre. My pre-trip research had shown me that they were performing Agatha Christie’s Spider’s Web. Being an amateur theatrical myself, I thought it’d be good to support another theatre in their endeavours. It’s a pleasant theatre, with I’d say around 150 seats, which were well populated, and a good bar nicely stocked (with punters as well as drinks). Hebden Wheat is a fine tipple if you like your local ales, by the way. The production suffered only from being wordy, but had a strong, capable cast that prevented the verbosity from marring things.\nThe next day gave me a bit more chance to have a look around Todmorden before meeeting up with the other cruciverbalist types. The toy museum was still closed, but the market was very much like the farmer’s markets we’re beginning to see in Sunderland. Now, I often think it’s a shame to go to a whole new place and visit those places you’d find in your own high street, but with Wetherspoons I make an exception, so I chose that for somewhere to go to have a sit down and a stab at the crossword. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone in there and not sampled their wares, so an impromptu pint of Pendle Porter was purchased. Odd how my altruistic turns often end up in me buying beer, but I digress.\nThe Sloggers and Betters meeting attracted perhaps 15 to 20 people, including setters such as Tramp of the Guardian and Anax and Tyrus of the Independent. The Bramsche Bar had a good selection of beers, and therefore so did I. Foodwise, the fish finger sarnie with chips failed to disappoint – such a thing rarely does. Lots of crosswordy talk ensued, and I left with a bunch of crosswords and the distinct feeling that I might have a hangover the next day. Fortunately, that prophecy did not come to pass.\nMy plan for the Sunday was to meet a friend in York mid-afternoon, but before then I’d take a sort of long way back, so I could do a bit of sightseeing, including the infamous Pendle Hill, where there be witches. I wonder if it’s a coincidence that the A666 is near there. In the event, I didn’t get the best view of it, with the weather being wet and the hill being draped in cloud. Tourism fail #1. My next plan was to go to Skipton and see the castle, which was closed. Tourism fail#2. However, a local tea room was open, so a cup of tea, a scone and a crossword passed some time off the road. Do I know how to party, or what? After that, my plan was to see Mother Shipton’s Cave in Knaresborough. Unfortunately, it was going to be £6 to see what’s basically a hole, so I bothered not. Tourism fail #3, one might say. Needing to familiarise myself with the route into York, I stopped at the local Lidl car park. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have used their car park and not bought something, and the 4 bottles of beer for a fiver was very reasonable, so along came another four bottles to add to those bought on Friday.\nHaving arrived in York, I spent a few decades finding a parking space, and my friend and I went off for a walk around the town and a pizza. Of course, it would have been wrong of me to have gone to the town and not thought of an excuse to buy beer, so off we went to the most fabulously-named beer shop in Christendom, The House of the Trembling Madness, and another four bottles came with me. Then it was off back home, loaded with 14 lovely bottles.\nSo, I have discovered a lot of new places around Yorkshire and Lancashire, and a lot of new beers to boot. Personally, I call that a successful trip, even if the sightseeing sucked. Two outta three ain’t bad, though.\nDeaths in Sport\nThis weekend, there was a sporting tragedy. Piermario Morosini, a footballer for Italian team Livorno, collapsed and died during a match against Pescara. There have been tributes to the player from all over the world, as one might reasonably expect. One such tribute was made on the scoreboard at Wembley Stadium prior to today’s FA Cup semi-final. A fine gesture, to my mind.\nI do not, in any way, wish to downplay the scale of this tragedy. Instead, I want to highlight two further tragedies that have taken place in sport this weekend. These are not lesser tragedies, but they have not had anything like the same coverage as Morosini in the media – and where they have been mentioned, the two deaths have been cited as merely a risk of the sport.\nSo which sports stars am I talking about? These were Synchronised and According to Pete, two of the horses in the “Grand” National at Aintree. Now, if you’re about to stop reading this after realising that I’m another whingeing leftie going on about bloody animal rights again, then you’re probably exactly the sort of person who needs to keep reading this. Leave Facebook alone for a moment, and at least read what I have to say. If you don’t agree, leave a comment – free speech, open debate, and all that.\nDeaths such as this are not uncommon in the so-called Sport of Kings (see here). But they are ignored, and the general public are often ignorant to them. Not surprising, given how the deaths usually occur. A horse will fall, and break a leg. Because of difficulties in treating a horse with such an injury, there is usually little option other than to have the horse euthanised. Killed, in more straightforward terms. This fate befalls around 400 horses per season. Seriously. That’s a huge number.\nConsider football for a moment. If 400 players a season died in that sport, there’d be hell on. There’d be calls from all quarters, whingeing leftie or not, for the sport to be banned. So why does the same not happen here?\n“There’s a risk in every sport.” Certainly, there is. I’ve been injured playing charades, so I know. But even in high contact sports such as rugby or boxing, is there really such a high risk of death that 400 competitors a year might die from it? And is it the horses choosing to take that risk?\n“It’s traditional.” Illogical, Captain. Doing something just because it’s been done before on regular occasions, despite what problems it might cause? Have a word with yourself.\n“They’re only animals.” That gives them fewer rights than humans for what reason, exactly?\nAnother factor is that most people are unaware that horses are dying, at least in such numbers. Let’s face it, we don’t actually see the horses dying. I myself wasn’t aware of the problem until about six years ago. But the fact remains that we’re forcing animals to compete in a sport in which they have a very real chance of dying. Many of you out there, as I did in the past, will have a flutter on the gee-gees now and again, thinking it to be harmless fun. It really isn’t.\nMy preference would be for the sport to be banned. It wouldn’t be a popular move, but the ethical choice will not always be the popular one. But without the power to do that, all I can do is boycott any betting, even office sweepstakes on horse races. And I’d urge everyone reading this to do the same. If we can’t stop the needless deaths of horses, at least let’s do something to stop people profiting from it.\nLas Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?\nApples on Tour – Liverpool\nI get around England quite a lot – sadly, rarely abroad (despite the ten small years I spent in Africa). Sometimes cities, where there are lots of things (pubs/art galleries/museums/pubs) to discover, sometimes remote rural places that might have their own charms (pubs/walks/pretty nature/pubs). So I though I’d blog about them. Or brag about them. Only two letters difference.\nSo, to Liverpool. It’s a city I’ve always wanted to visit, for numerous reasons. It’s where we find Anfield, home to Liverpool FC – my second team (every Boro fan must have one, for when the times get tough). It’s also where the Beatles and the Merseybeat movement started out. These alone were enough to make me fancy a cross-Pennine trip to Merseyside. All I needed was an excuse.\nThen came the news that the Green Party were to hold their Spring conference in the city. With the realisation that I had been granted a cracking excuse, I made the various bookings and looked for what else I could do when not pretending to be a Very Important Conference Delegate. The Delphic Oracle (aka Wikipedia) told me that the Walker Art Gallery had an impressive collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. In art appreciation terms, to me at least, this is as dearly welcome as Tim Burton ringing me up and telling me that he loved my last show, and would I like to be in Sleepy Hollow 2? Lots to be excited about for this trip, then. There was also the possibility of the Liverpool/Everton derby at Anfield – until the Reds selfishly went and got themselves into the League Cup Final.\nI arrived on a nice warm Friday afternoon in February, not something often associated with the North-west. I managed to register for conference and get into the hall just in time for the Caroline Lucas’s speech, after which I took a quick walk around the general area of the hotel, working out where cashpoints, newsagents, et cetera, were. No tourism that night, just fish and chips, really. Later on, there was free organic real ales at the conference. Not for the whole night, but that didn’t stop me.\nSaturday I woke up in great surprise – no hangover, though by all rights I should have had one. The Adeplhi hotel’s Full English is quite satisfactory (having the benefits of hash browns and black pudding – and those farl bread thingies you get in Irish brekkies). Afterwards, I took a walk through Liverpool, on a pilgrimage to the Cavern Club. If you don’t know what that is, don’t ask me because I’ll look at you with utter derision. Please just nod and smile. My map reading skills left a lot to be desired as I ended up going the wrong way at some point, but at least that helped me find Forbidden Planet. Eventually, I found the Cavern. I’ve since been told it wasn’t the original building, but that didn’t stop it feeling like I’d turned up in THAT stable in Bethlehem (though it’s bigger than that, obviously). Music memorabilia lines the walls, it has a dark, Trillians-y look about it, and a cracking performance venue to one side (to get to which, you have to pass four huge faces of the Fab Four). I had a pint as I looked around, and bought the t-shirt.\nThere was further tourism to be done, after some party business. I took a walk over to the Walker Art Gallery, and there’s some fabulous neoclassical architecture about the place – St. George’s Hall is a bloody massive edifice with huge Corinthian columns and statues agogo in front of it, including a huge statue of Disraeli. Wellington’s Column, if indeed that’s what it’s called, was probably as big (though nowhere near as cool) as Nelson’s Column. The gallery didn’t disappoint. Waterhouse, Millais, Martin and Alma-Tadema were all represented, though the crown in their jewel is Fournier’s The Funeral of Shelley. Also interesting was the Matisse exhibition – mostly because the flagship work, Icarus, was a significant thing in the film I did last year. Saturday was meant to end with a quiz at the conference, though any idea of msyelf and another member of the Sunderland Greens annihilating the other teams with our superior intelligence was mown down by us missing the sign telling us that the quiz had moved to another room.\nSunday morning was part two of the Liverpool architectural trail. I had a walk to the dock area to have a look at the famous Liver Building. Along with the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, it forms the “Three Graces” of Liverpool’s dockside. Each building is worth the trip there on its own, but the Liver Building stands out from the other two, with the Liver bird statues that appear on each of its twin towers. After a brief period of standing around in awe of these buildings, I had a look around the Museum of Liverpool, which is much like any other museum based around a city – rudimentary stone-age tools, stuff from local industries of old and what Liverpool did during the war. Then it was back to the conference, but not before finding time to buy a Liverpool FC shirt at the club shop. No time to visit Anfield, unfortunately, but I did at least get to watch Liverpool’s penalty shoot-out win in the League Cup Final. Come on you Reds.\nSo, I have not been disappointed by this eagerly-awaited trip. There’s probably a lot more to discover about Liverpool, as there always will be with any place. So I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m back at some point. Next time Boro play here, perhaps.\nA Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nRetrospection\nIt’s been a hell of a year, if I’m honest. There have been some bad moments, certainly, but looking back, I’d prefer to concentrate on the good points. As I’ve done the past couple of years, I’ll sum it up month-by-month.\nJanuary: The year got off to a cracking start as I had the opportunity of a lifetime – to perform Shakespeare in front of a person who’s not only a personal hero of mine, but who’s also one of the finest Shakespearean actors alive – Sir Ian McKellen, in Macbeth.\nFebruary: I auditioned for a film. And got the part, as a transsexual in Rid of You, produced by students from the University of Sunderland.\nMarch: Filming of the aforementioned movie, along with bagging a third part at The Royalty in a season.\nApril: The month of birthday celebrations, as ever, memorable for certain reasons that I shan’t elucidate. Plus, becoming a local election candiate for the Green Party. And – finally passing the driving test!\nMay: Came third in the local elections, defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Performed in Funny Money at the Royalty, playing a corrupt detective. Had never done a farce before – great fun. First car, Toyota Yaris, bought. Scary having to hand over that amount of money.\nJune: A second visit to Grizedale in the Lake District, this time to see Kate compete in the Great North Swim. Took the baritone ukulele; a shame that the only tune I had was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. At least I could profess to being able to play Mozart.\nJuly: Performing in ‘Allo ‘Allo with the Washington Theatre Group, the first night proving eventful. A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies followed, as did another trip to Grizedale for Kate’s birthday. The uke came along again; this time I was armed with something that might passably have been called a repertoire.\nAugust: Attended an historical event – Sunderland’s first ever Pride parade. Or was this September? Anyway…\nSeptember: Back to the Royalty to play Otto Frank in the Diary of Anne Frank. Most substantial part I’ve had there, and I think the most challenging.\nOctober: Trip to Cleethorpes for Nina’s wedding, along with a chance for a good long drive which took me over the Humber Bridge.\nNovember: Wrote a novel in 26 days (blog on that coming soon). Trip to Derby for a meet-up with crosswordy types – lovely place, Derby. Some fine local ales, and I’d highly recommend Mr. Simms sweet shop.\nDecember: Celebrating five years with the Washington Theatre Group. More of that, please.\nCan 2012 possibly be better? We shall see…\nFive Years and Counting\nFive years ago today, my life changed.\nThis is far from hyperbole. It began with a chance invitation to a party, and those people who know me in the present day will know where it currently is. And hopefully, it’ll keep on going.\n18th December, 2006. Nigel and I were invited to a party by our friends Carl and Phil. Cat, our estimable hostess, had worked on a film with them, and had told them to invite some friends along to a Christmas bash. It was there that I discovered that most of the guests were members of Washington Theatre Group. I’d done a fair amount of theatre in my youth, but after going to university and discovering beer, I’d mostly forgotten about it. The members present were a delightful bunch, so I thought I’d pop along, with Nigel in tow.\nThe first night turned out to be a dress rehearsal for their panto, Cinderella. Despite having dabbled with theatre before, I couldn’t help but think that I’d never be able to do what they were doing. None more so than Peter and Neil playing the ugly sisters. The very thought of it – I’d just look silly! And it’d only be a year before I was playing a dame myself.\nConfidence comes a lot more easily than we’d often think. My first role with the group was in Blue Remembered Hills, where I began the play running around pretending to be a Spitfire, like you do. Massively nervous the first time they wanted me to rehearse that – and it showed. Cue, however, Pamela, Angela and Nigel giving me a hand by running around like Spitfires themselves. Not an image that escapes one’s recollection too easily – and it worked. By the first night, I’d got Spitfire imitation down to a T – though flapping wings was perhaps stretching the imagination a little.\nThat show lasted two nights, which was a damned shame. But it had been a massive boost to my confidence, so much so that by the time of the re-auditioning for the dame in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, just a few months after, I was quite happy to put myself up for that part.\nBy the end of that show, I could count theatre as my main hobby. Since then, I have had numerous other roles with the group. Not only that, but it gave me the impetus to audition for a part with the Royalty Theatre, with whom I’ve now done six shows – the highlight being Macbeth, partly because it’s Shakespeare, partly because it was watched by a personal hero of mine – Sir Ian McKellen. Membership of that theatre has also led me to doing a single professional performance (ok, the pay was only £30, put it’s still pay).\nAll the while, I’ve continued to perform with WTG, and in February this led to me being cast in a student film – which was an excellent experience, and an eye-opener into the film-making process.\nIn the programme for Cinderella, Cat made a comment on the group (and this has always stayed with me) along the lines that the group had given her the confidence to feel that she could do anything. This could easily sound like pure rhetoric, but after five years I can say that it’s quite true. These days, I’m more than happy to take on challenges that previously I would have thought entirely beyond me, such as learning to play the baritone ukulele or writing a novel (which I did – and I’ll have to do a blog on that one, soon).\nSo yes, it isn’t exaggerating to say that the Washington Theatre Group has been life-changing. I certainly hope that it continues to be so.\nPoppies and the England Team\nSo, the England team have been banned from wearing poppies. That’s the way that the press are putting it, making it sound like England are being victimised. FIFA’s response is apparently that they oppose political messages on shirts. You will have your own opinion as to whether or not a poppy counts as such. But I think that this issue isn’t quite as black and white.\nA good deal is made about wearing a poppy. Even the British Legion’s advertisements tell you to wear poppies. But isn’t it more the fact that you’ve paid for the poppy that counts? I could wear as many poppies my clothing will allow, but if I’ve paid for none, then I’ve hardly been much use. It could be argued that wearing one is good advertising, or raises awareness, and that will certainly be true to some extent – but it’s hardly a substitute for making a donation to the charity.\nDespite this, last weekend in the Premier League, we saw all teams with poppies printed on their shirts. But were these paid for? I’d certainly hope that clubs, or the players, made a substantial donation for the right to do this, otherwise it feels a little lip-servicey, if not hypocritical. If you know one way or the other, please tell me.\nSo, back to England. If the poppy is not a political symbol (and I more or less sway to that opinion), then there’s probably no reason for FIFA to disallow it. However, I do think it should be up to individual players to choose if they want to wear it. There’s always a chance that for whatever reason, a player might not want to wear it, and they should not be forced to, either by the powers that be, or peer pressure. And if a player does wear it, a suitable donation to the charity should be made.\nIf there is a case to make for it being a political symbol (please let me know if you think it is), then I think my points in the previous paragraph are even more important – as it would almost be forcing a person to display a political symbol with which they don’t agree. And that is never right.\nSo I think there’s more to this argument that “we should” or “we shouldn’t”. Personal choice, rather than social pressure, has to play a part.\nOut of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2011_12_29_a-novel-idea/content_60.html": "A Novel Idea\nI loved creative writing in school. It was the one subject where remembering facts, dates, formulae, et cetera didn’t matter. No right or wrong answers, just putting down on paper what was in my head. Sometimes my teachers thought I went a bit too far with my creativity, but I always considered that their problem. After all, what’s wrong with a story in which you travel to the moon, jump in a crater and find yourself at a Wham concert? Exactly.\nAnd, I’ve continued to love it. Every now and again, I’d write a short story. In 2005, I began to write a novel, after an idea I’d got in 1999. It got as far as 19,000-odd words before I decided I didn’t know what was going to happen next, and since then, I just haven’t got around to working out any more of the plot.\nIn about 2006, I heard about NaNoWriMo – National Novel Writing Month. The idea is that within the month of November, you write a novel. More precisely, a novel of at least 50,000 words. Fairly short for a novel, but a novel nonetheless. The plot can be worked out before November 1st, and editing can be done after November 30th, but no writing must take place before November, and by the end of the month, at least 50,000 words are required.\nThere’s no prize other than pride and a nice little certificate to print out. The point, of course, is to get people writing – to give people like me, who’ve fancied the idea of writing a novel for ages, the impetus to do it. Granted, one could do such a thing at any time of the year – but there’s something about a target set outside of your control that can spur you on, specifically if you have support from friends (you can have “Writing Buddies” in the manner of social network friends) and if you have support from the organisers (you get pep talks from writers and former winners). Just as a person who fancies running a marathon can benefit from this kind of support, so can a writer – after all, this is little more than a writing marathon.\nThis year, I thought I’d give it a go. Firstly, of course, I needed an idea. This came easily. In 2006, I’d had an idea about a story whereby some underdog/everyman type of protagonist, a librarian, is thrust into a quest for the Holy Grail, impelled his mysterious and beautiful boss – the grail being something quite different to what common folklore tells us. I’d had a go at writing something on this idea at the time of its inception, which never got past a page of A4. As the rules of NaNoWriMo stated that I couldn’t have written anything previously, I was going to have to start from scratch. Which was a good thing, as the original wasn’t that good, in my humble opinion.\nAs November 1st approached, little plot points would develop in my head. I’d worked out who the boss woman was, her motivations, et cetera, and got an idea as to how it was going to start. But…50,000 words? That seemed like quite a target. That averages at 1667 words per day. As a practice to see what effort that might require, I wrote this. Suddenly, it didn’t seem so bad. The question was whether or not I’d be able to sustain that over the 30 days – assuming I didn’t reach the end of the story early.\nI began writing minutes after November began happening. In the first 24 hours, I got through about 2000-odd words. In the first week, I managed to carry on quite well, not always hitting my target but certainly moving steadily. I wrote in the hours I was at home; at other times I’d sketch the plot in a notebook if I had spare time but no access to my laptop.\nAfter about a week, I had become practised at writing at length, and found that it came much more easily. Some days I’d get more than double the daily target. I’d normally be aware of what the next few chapters would need to be, and tried to get 1,500 to 2,000 words per chapter, which became easier to do as time went by. I was also feeling that I wan’t needing to plan as much of the plot in advance as I had done in the early stages – it wasn’t exactly writing itself, but it seemed to come more naturally.\nBy the third week, I was ahead of my target and each day becoming further ahead (which allowed me to have the odd day’s breather). My only worry, after about three weeks, was that the story wasn’t going to last for 50,000 words. I had about three more chapters that had to happen, and 7,000 words to go. But my naïvety as a writer proved a blessing – I realised that there was an important plot point that had not been explained. This allowed me to introduce two more chapters – one to explain it, making a minor character very much more important, and one related chapter to solve another plot quandary I was in. As a result, only death or serious illness was going to stop me finishing, as I was four or five days ahead of where I needed to be, with maybe 3,500 words needed out of three chapters.\nI hit the 50,000 mark on a train to Derby. The magical word was “find”, though I only noticed that I’d surpassed this mark ten words late. It felt bloody good, though. The next day, November 26th, I finished in true author style – holed up in a hotel room with a “Do not disturb” sign on the door. 53,000+ words, according to the NaNoWriMo site (52,000+ according to Word – presumably as it doesn’t count hyphenations). Either way, 50,000 words was my bitch.\nIt’ll need polishing, of course. As yet, I haven’t had the time to go through it and find the mistakes, continuity errors and other anomalies that are bound to be there. I don’t flatter myself that it’ll make Stephen King worry about his living, but it’s my novel and I like it. I got to the 50,000 word mark and that’s all I wanted to do – to prove to myself that I could.\nAnd I’d advise anyone who’s ever wanted to write a novel to try the same. Go on, what do you have to lose?\nHave your say!",

  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_liberal-democrats/content_61.html": "The 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.",

Go on, what do you have to lose?\nOut of Date\nA short piece I’ve written as a practice for NaNoWriMo, to see how much work an average day’s worth of writing would require. Enjoy.\nOut of Date\nJemima switched on the tap, and let it run. Work had been an utter bitch that day, with Mr. Bogface being in an even fouler mood that usual. Mr. Bogface was a jobsworth manager of the worst kind, and seemed to have an especial dislike for Jemima, probably because she was a woman, young and better at the job than he ever was. As a journalist for the Ayresome Gazette, Jemima had spent the last four years carving out a great career for herself, and there were rumours that one or two of the national dailies had tried to court her. Old Bogface had been a journalist there for thirty years before being moved into a management position and his only contribution to the national press had been a stern letter to the Telegraph about the quality of its crossword.\nThat day, Jemima had penned a frightfully good article about corruption in the local council. The Council leader, it had been rumoured, had been taking bribes from local businessmen to work local legislation in their favour. Jemima’s network of informants had given her a wealth of information on the situation. When combined with her talent for writing, this had produced a document which most at the paper thought would really shift copies. Most, that is, apart from Mr. Bogface. It didn’t help that he was a good friend of the Council leader, but he didn’t want to say much about that. He just made Jemima’s day as hard as possible – constant putdowns, numerous pointless errands and requests for re-writes of other stories.\nBut Jemima had finished work for the day, and was now looking forward to a relaxing bath. She’d make herself a drink, and lie in the bath with a good book for about an hour, forgetting the horrible day she’d had and simply wallowing in the blissfully hot water.\nAs the bath ran, she wondered what drink she could take in with her. There was nothing alcoholic in the house; she wasn’t teetotal, but it had all been drunk at an all-night party the week before (she still couldn’t remember who that had been under the mistletoe – nor why there was mistletoe, as it was July). She didn’t fancy a coffee, as it might have kept her awake. Hot chocolate? Why not, eh?\nJemima had some idea that she might have some cocoa powder in the cupboard. Her hypothesis proved correct, but only after mounting an expedition right to the back of the cupboard, past instant mashed potato, rice, stock cubes and spice jars that might have been there since God was a boy. On taking the small jar of cocoa powder from the cupboard, it occurred to her to check the sell-by date on the bottom. September 2006, it read. This was November 2011. Cynical about the idea that cocoa powder could go off, she took the lid off the jar and peered inside. No mould, no weevils, nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just cocoa powder. Ah well, she thought, what’s the worst that could happen? Jemima stuck three heaped spoonfuls into a cup, added milk, boiling water and a bit of honey to sweeten it. The bath having run, she placed her mug on the side of the bath, took up her book and tentatively got into the steaming hot bath. She spent a few seconds acclimatising herself to the heat, and then opened the book where she’d bookmarked it, and began to read.\nSoon, Jemima was immersed in the book and had clean forgotten about her hot chocolate. Such was Jemima’s interest in the book that her peripheral vision failed to spot something happening. The liquid in the cup began to bubble a little. Had Jemima been watching it, she’d have noticed a number of little bubbles appearing. The bubbles would appear to harden, and by degrees, would turn an ominously dark shade of green. Eventually the bubbles would begin moving around the liquid as though they were themselves alive. And every now and again, one of these “bubbles” would leap out of the cup. Some went onto the floor, others into the bath.\nJemima had been immersed in the book for some time, and didn’t notice a thing out of the ordinary until one of these dark green globules innocently floated past her. Jemima did a double take thinking, for some reason, that it might have been a spider. Sitting up in the tub, she quickly realised that it wasn’t. And from her new vantage point, she saw a mass of other similar globules at the tap end of the bath. They were everywhere – in the tub, on the floor, on the side of the bath – even a few in the sink. And every few seconds, a new one would pop out of the cup of hot chocolate.\nNot entirely sure what to do, she thought the best course of action would be to jump out of the bath, going “Aaaaaaaargh!” Moving away from those globules on the floor, she picked up a towel and dried herself, keeping an eye on the strange little things. She replaced the towel and put her clothes back on, as though not being naked would make everything go away. Unfortunately it didn’t.\nJemima surveyed the scene in her bathroom. What were these things? Okay, she thought, that’s the last time I ignore a sell-by date. Was it mould? Was it something living in the cocoa powder? Or just some odd chemical reaction? She moved toward the sink, to take a look at one that was hanging on the edge of the basin.\nIt looked like a marble; a sphere about a centimetre in diameter, dark green and with a glossy surface. Some remnant so the hot chocolate still encrusted it. The globule just sat there, doing nothing. She took a look at the cup of hot chocolate. Nothing more was coming from it. The globules were doing nothing. Nonetheless, she didn’t want to touch them, as she wasn’t sure how harmful they might be. A few minutes passed, and her common sense returned. Just some crazy chemical reaction, she thought. If I can tidy them up, things should be okay. She went away to find a dust pan and brush.\nShe returned a few seconds later, but when she saw the globules, she was petrified with fear. The globules appeared to be growing legs. She looked around at them, half in wonder, half scared. One leg appeared to be growing at a time, though by now, some had six legs, others were just growing their first. They were looking for all the world like they were growing into glassy spiders, and Jemima absolutely hated spiders. She hated being anywhere near them, and would sooner have had to spend a night with Mr. Bogface than to have to deal with them at all. Nearly, anyway.\nAs she watched in horror, it seemed that her worst fears were being realised. Some of the globules had grown eight legs, and these ones were beginning to change in other ways – growing extra body sections, hair, eyes, jaws. The one saving grace, in Jemima’s eyes, was that they were not moving. Just, somehow, turning into a large army of glazed, shimmering arachnids. They were truly fearsome, and Jemima thanked numerous gods in which she didn’t believe that they couldn’t move. She hoped they wouldn’t. Jemima stood there for about half an hour, not wanting to move in case they did, and formulating plans as to the best way to get the hell out of there if one of them so much as moved one of their infernal hairs.\nSoon, Jemima was more or less at ease. She still knew not what these things were, but again thought that if she could just get them dumped in the bin, things would be fine. But she was to be proven wrong on this point. For almost as soon as she’d taken up her dustpan and brush and was steeling herself to scoop up the one closest to her, she spotted one beginning to grow wings.\nJemima jumped back against the wall. She looked on in utter terror as all of these apparent spiders grew wings. Flying spiders was her ultimate terror. She hated spiders enough – but if any could pester you in the way that wasps could, that would be so much the worse. One by one, the “spiders” grew wings. But they were still not moving, thankfully. Eventually, her bathroom was full of them. It looked like she’d spontaneously set up a macabre glassworks in her bathroom, and it only briefly occurred to her that she might be able to sell these as souvenirs for tourists. Only briefly, for two reasons – one, her house wasn’t a tourist resort, and two, the little buggers had begun to move.\nJemima saw them moving and was pinned to the wall in fright. Her instincts were telling her to get out of the house and call the Ghostbusters or somebody, but she couldn’t move. Every muscle in her body was paralysed. It seemed that the little creatures were looking right as her. For a while they seemed to be getting to grips with their new-found mobility, like horrifying, miniature Bambis-on-Ice. However, as soon as they found their feet, as it were, they began to move slowly toward Jemima. Closer and closer they got to Jemima, who by now was almost in shock, and in no danger of moving anywhere. She’d been looking down at the marching army of spiders, but suddenly looked up to something she’d spotted from the corner of her eye, and found herself face-to-cephalothorax with a flying specimen. She fainted.\nThe spiders moved over her body, lying on the ground, and proceeded to dine upon her flesh. Voraciously, they devoured her, until in a few short hours, nothing was left but her bones and clothes.\nHer skeleton was discovered a couple of weeks later. Sergeant Orange was most puzzled by the affair, as there was no indication as to how the body of a young, fit woman could suddenly be divested of all its flesh.\n“I’ve no idea,” he told his colleague, Constable Tomato. “No forced entry, no chemicals that might have had some odd effect. Only a cup of hot chocolate in the bathroom. Never has a good effect on my guts, that stuff, but it’s never turned me into a skeleton.”\nConstable Tomato stifled a grin. He loved hot chocolate. So much, in fact, that he’d snaffled the jar he’d found in the kitchen. Nobody would miss it. And as soon as he got home, he’d enjoy a nice big mug of it.\n© John Appleton 2010",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_09_22_nude-glorious-nude/content_73.html": "Nude Glorious Nude\n(Oliver-based title pun, ‘cos the production currently at Newcastle Theatre Royal is very worth seeing. But I digress).\nOkay, so this morning, I got up at half-past four and jumped in the North Sea with no clothes on. As I’m now home and dry (literally), have caught up on some sleep, and the feeling has come back to my extremities, I can now tell the full dramatic story – including why I would do such a thing, and whether or not it was good for me.\nIt was a few months ago when I first heard that it was happening, through Facebook. My intial reaction was “You’ll never get me doing that”. Then I was a maybe. Then a definite yes. But why, I hear you all ask, would you want to get up at daft o’clock on a weekend, take off every stitch of clothing, and go swimming in some bloody freezing water? It’s a fair question. One, I like my weekend lie-ins. Two, I don’t exactly have the body of a Greek god. Three, the North Sea is surely very cold.\nHowever, it occurred to me that this was something of a challenge to my personal confidence. There was a time when I’d never even contemplate such a thing, but these days, I’m a lot more inclined to push my own boundaries. We all have our comfort zones. But I feel that if we occasionally allow ourselves to go even just a small way out of that, even though it may be scary, when we get through it, we’ve created a greater comfort zone. And the more we do that, the more we can expect to achieve generally.\nPsychotherapeutic ramblings aside, there was also the charity aspect. Like many of the participants, I raised money for Mind, a mental health charity. So these two reasons were good enough, I thought, to deprive myself of a Saturday sleep-in and some body heat.\nI duly signed up and awaited my fate. Now, I’m pleased to report that the whole thing was tremendous fun. Quick cup of coffee immediately after getting up, and then into the car, with two more intrepid dippers. By 6.15 we were at the dip site, acclimatising ourselves to the temperature (about 5.5 degrees, according to the BBC’s coverage). The sand in particular was very, very cold, so not too kind to our feet. It left me wondering just how cold the water would be.\nEventually, the appointed time arrived, and at the signal, 146 people took off their clothes and ran for the sea, like an army of excited Reginald Perrins. On getting to the sea, I was surprised. It was actually a decent temperature; better than the air temperature at any rate. It didn’t take too long to get used to; soon I was swimming about, dodging waves and basically enjoying thre freedom of being in the water with nothing on. It really is a liberating feeling, much more so when there are numerous others doing the same thing.\nBut getting out of the water was the worst thing, as then I was cold again, and though I got into some warm clothes sharpish, it took a while for my feet to feel like there was blood running around them again. A sausage sarnie and a coffee from the handy van helped. But I did leave feeling that I really should have stayed in longer. This is my only regret.\nSo yeah, the comfort zone I spoke of earlier has been expanded, and I’d most likely do this, or something similar, again. I’m still not terribly pleased with my body, but this isn’t to say that I feel ashamed of it. Because, as anyone who does attend such events will testify, naked people are not all supposed to look like underwear models. They look like real people, just without clothes. And there’s something undefinably cool and natural about that.\nSo many thanks to Jax and Mark for organising it, to those who sponsored me, and to those who re-tweeted my adverts for it (including John Prescott, no less). It’s done me a lot of good, and hopefully Mind, too.\nhomeclothesfree said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 1:31 pm\nReblogged this on home clothes free.\noddbodd13 said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 11:25 pm\nMany thanks for that.\nhomeclothesfree said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 11:30 pm\nHey it was a good post ending reading thank you for sharing we need more honest expressions of nudist experiences\nsassycoupleok said,\nSeptember 30, 2012 at 4:34 pm\nBroadening one’s horizons thru simple nudity or group nudity can be quite energizing!\nRetrospection « Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky said,\nDecember 28, 2012 at 4:08 pm\n[…] foreigner, an immigrant with a job.

Isn’t that where it always rains?” Point 1, it’s England, and that pretty much applies everywhere. Point 2, so what? Not for me the holiday lying on a beach getting a tan, no. There are more things under the sun than, er, the sun, and if I want to find them in Manchester, that’s what I’m gonna do. Deal with it.\nSo yeah, the real purpose of the visit was to see the latest show by the Didsbury Players, formerly the Celesta Players – a community theatre group based in the leafy Manchester suburb of Didsbury. But since it’s pointless going all that way just for a night, Nige and I decided to make a weekend of it, and cram whatever other entertainment in that we could. In this endeavour, one must say we’ve succeeded.\nFriday morning saw us jump in the Yaris and head down the A1. Yep, I’d have preferred an environmentally-friendly train, but thanks to our “greenest government ever”, that would have cost us about four times as much, illogically. But there are plus points to this approach, and one was that we could have a quick stop-off at Wetherby for some lunch, before tackling the Pennines. The views in the cross-country drive are pretty good too, it’s just a shame that driving means you have to appreciate the view of HGVs more than the countryside.\nBut we got to the hotel in good time. We were more or less inbetween two suburbs of grand foliage – Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, one of those great weird place names that’s up there with Leighton Buzzard, Ashby-de-la-Zouche and Piddle-in-the-Hole. By coincidence, it was the weekend of the Chorlton Arts Festival, so we headed along there in the hope of securing tickets for a play, stopping at the Woodstock Arms on the way – lovely pint of Pendle Witches’ Brew. The play tickets had sold out, so instead we chose to go to a poetry event – Allison McVety, a poet who I’d not heard of, was giving a reading at a meeting of the Manky Poets, a local poetry recital group. Her poems were great to listen to, covering all manner of topics, light and dark. Equally interesting were her explanations of how she was inspired to create the poems – some food for thought for my own poetry there.\nOn Saturday we headed into central Manchester, as nothing was going to stop me from seeing the Pre-Raphaelite collection at the City Gallery, not even death. Thankfully such an occurrence did not need overcoming. We got there via a pub called The Bank, where the wild boar burger was brilliant. Then off to the gallery, and I wasn’t disappointed. The Pre-Raphaelite collection was represented by the full Brotherhood – Millais, Hunt and Rosetti, as well as Burne-Jones, Waterhouse, and both Leightons, among others. Also there was Alma-Tadema (what a beautiful painting Silver Favourites is), Canaletto, Sargent, Sandys and plenty more. An excellent venue if you like British art.\nA visit to the Museum of Science and Industry was next – all machinery great and small, old and new, comprised the exhibits – mostly with a Lancashire flavour, as you might expect. Looms, planes, trains, bloody huge computers, all sorts of things to excite the discerning science nerd.\nBut after that, the reason for the visit – off to Didsbury Cricket Club for the show. Yup, these guys play out of a cricket club – the function room, to be precise. One of the fascinating things about this group is how little they have to work with, and how much they make of it. Their show last year took up about half of the room. This year, a quarter – basically the room’s dancefloor. There are only two ways to enter or exit the stage, and the room has nowhere to hang lights, so the group is limited in those respects. But we were nonetheless treated to two funny, entertaining plays – Stars in their Eyes, a short one about a group of astronomers waiting for (and managing to miss) the transit of Venus, and a longer one, Forte!, a story of a small musical instrument shop that manages to give their big corporate competitor the comeuppance they deserve. The latter play required multiple sets, a lot of props and entrances and exits – which must surely be difficult to arrange on such a small stage. But they managed this very well, which is testament to the group’s resourcefulness. After the show, it was off to the Didsbury arms to sample the Hobgoblin on draft. Niiiiiice.\nSunday morning took us to Stockport, that lovely tropical paradise. The Crown pub was the first port of call, and on entering, i could see why I’d heard of its name in legends. Thirteen ale taps I counted, and I had a go of the Atlantic Jade, which proved a wise choice. We were joined by Jennie and James from the Didsbury Players, and went off to visit the Hat Museum – Stockport having once been a capital of millinery. The lowest floor was full of all sorts of crazy hat-making machinery, and the middle floor just full of hats – more than enough to satifsy a former member of the National Hat Society.\nAfter a cup of tea at Jennie and James’s, it was time to return home, where this humble travelog is now being written. I’m knackered, but pleased that I’ve had around 48 hours in one of the most cultured cities I know, and have been able to fit so much culture-vultury in. Huzzah.\nEau Naturel\nYeah, punning in French now. Anyway, in honour of the recent North-East Skinny Dip, an Anacreontic ode (good for upbeat celebration of something so free-spirited) on the fun we had…\nEau Naturel\nTwenty-second of September!\nWhat a morning to remember!\nScores of people in the nip,\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\nThere we stood at Druridge Bay,\nAt the very break of day.\nWaiting on the icy sand,\nDipping hour close at hand.\nFinally we got the call:\n“Okay, dippers – bear it all!”\nOff it came, right then and there,\nEverybody’s underwear.\nLiberated from our clothes,\nOff we ran, with frozen toes\nStraight into the foaming brine,\nAs the sun began to shine.\nHordes of people filled the sea,\nIn the name of charity.\nMen and women, young and old,\nBody sizes manifold.\nDodging waves, we swam about,\nFree and easy, wearing nowt.\nAll around were laughs and hoots,\nFrom the folk in birthday suits.\nProud to show their naked forms,\nChallenging the social norms.\nNot a body part seemed rude,\nWith so many in the nude.\nOnce we all had swum enough,\nOut we stumbled, in the buff.\nClothed and warm, we got some scran\nFrom the handy burger van.\nThis much needed body heat\nPut some feeling in my feet.\nBack home, I was pleased to find\nLoads of money raised for Mind;\nTV, radio and papers\nCovering our naked capers.\nBest of all, I think I’ve grown,\nChallenging my comfort zone –\nFor I’d had the guts to strip\nFor the North-East Skinny Dip!\n© John Appleton 2012\nUsquebaugh\nIn the spirit (pun intended) of my last blog, I expect you to memorise it. Detention for those who don’t.\nUsquebaugh\nThe room is dark, the record player goes.\nMy sofa welcomes me with open arms.\nI lift the glass, and hold it to my nose,\nAnd breathe its heavy, dark and peaty charms.\nI drop it to my mouth and take a sip –\nIt stings my lips and slowly warms my throat.\nMy mind’s transported on a whisky trip,\nUpon a glassy, icy sailing boat.\nAnd with each drink, I’m further out to sea,\nThe Captain of a malty pleasure cruise.\nNo mates, no crew, a voyage just for me,\nTo sail the seven seas of Scottish booze.\n‘Til all at once, the final drop is gone –\nI think I’ll have to get another one!\n© John Appleton 2011\nPoetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nVoices\nBeen a while since I posted. Time for a poem, I think.\nVoices\nI have some voices in my head\nThat tell me what to do.\nTheir names are Jub, and Flib, and Xed,\nThere’s Grimp and Weeble, too.\nOne day the voices said to me,\n“Hey Johnny, listen close,\nYou have to make a cup of tea,\nAnd then some buttered toast”.\nSo off I went to make my drink,\nObedient and dumb,\nI never even stopped to think\nWhat harm to me might come.\nBut ‘cos the tea had been so nice,\nThe voices gained my trust.\nEach day I’d hear from them twice,\nDid what they said I must.\nBut then one fateful day, they said,\n“Hey Johnny, listen here:\nYou must shoot someone in the head,\nAnd we’ll give you some beer.”\nI found a gun with perfect ease.\nAnd then a victim, too.\nI gave the trigger such a squeeze\nIt turned my fingers blue.\nThe fellow’s brains went everywhere,\nThe room was red as hell.\nThe took me into special care –\nA private padded cell.\nNow you might ask me if I rue\nThe mess that got me here.\nAnd I would say, “Of course I do –\nI never got the beer!”\n© John Appleton 2010\nEdinburgh Fringe 2009\nFinally, after ten years of saying, “We have to do Edinburgh Fringe this year,” Nigel and I have finally managed to get there for more than 24 hours. We’ve taken in eight comedy shows, a concert, a poetry reading and a ghost tour. Among the artists we’ve seen have been the Tiger Lillies, Reginald D. Hunter, Rich Hall, Al Murray, Paul Merton and Frank Skinner.\nAs for the Fringe as a whole, I’ve been very impressed with it. There is so much there to see in all spheres of performance art. Comedy is the main thing, but there is also much in the way of drama (which I might have liked to see more of, had I had the time), music, dance and a little poetry, as aforementioned.\nFor an event that prides itself on being the world’s biggest arts festival, it would be easy to think that it might be terribly commercialised, with organisers charging top dollar (or pound) for everything. And it is, certainly very commercialised, but affordable nonetheless. The “affordable” tag in this case is used in its most literal sense. After all, anyone can afford free shows (presuming costs of travel and accommodation in Edinburgh can be met). It’s just a shame that the free shows (and possibly the shows dubbed “The £5 Fringe”) are not covered in the main festival events guide. I just hope this isn’t some snobbery on the part of the Fringe organisers.\nI would like to take a show up there one day, but such a thing’s a long way away at the moment.\nThe Zombie King\nI’m quite liking the sestina verse form – the same six words (or syllables) are used, in a specific pattern, to end the lines of each stanza, and also have a specific placing in the envoi. It’s like poetic sudoku. Here’s a vague attempt…\nThe Zombie King\nIt was a dark and stormy night,\nAnd shuffling in his earthy grave,\nThe figure of the Zombie King\nWas baying for a feast of blood.\nThe Grand High Priest of all the dead\nWould soon arise to seek his prey.\n‘Twas weeks since last he’d taken prey;\nAt last, a storm had come that night.\nThe wet ground stirred the Evil Dead,\nand made them restless in the grave.\nAnd one was hungry for some blood:\nIt was, of course, the Zombie King.\nAnd on the prowl, the Zombie King\nAt last had spotted tasty prey.\nA pure soul, whose virgin blood\nWould be a feast to make his night.\nThe girl stood by her father’s grave,\nAnd cried, and wished he wasn’t dead.\nBut now the Lord of all Undead,\nThe evil, mindless Zombie King,\nCrept silently toward the grave,\nWith eyes set firmly on his prey.\nIt was to be her final night;\nHe licked his lips: at last, some blood!\nHe pounced on her, it chilled her blood.\nHer screams amused the living dead,\nWhose laughter echoed through the night.\nAnd while she lay there, panicking,\nShe had one choice: to hope and pray\nShe wouldn’t die on Daddy’s grave.\nHe pinned his victim to the grave,\nWith yellow fangs he drew her blood.\nA tasty meal, his virgin prey,\nAnd soon the hapless girl was dead.\nA triumph for the Zombie King,\nUpon that dark and stormy night.\nBack in the grave, the Evil Dead\nWere drunk on blood, and hailed their King,\nAnd prayed for more another night.\n© John Appleton 2009",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_lgbtiq/content_66.html": "Flipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nRid of You\nSo, this is the film what I made last year. Enjoy.\nUpdate: The video’s been removed; I’ll keep an eye out to see if it appears again.\nAlan Turing’s Centenary\nHe might have been 100 this coming weekend. You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2009_06_23_artistic-justification/content_74.html": "Artistic Justification\nLast week, I took part in a run of performances of The Graduate. The Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft movie is remembered by many, though it’s not one of my favourite movies (great music and cinematography, but that’s beside the point). I do much prefer the play version; it’s snappier and has some great humour. Fun to perform, too.\nThe play calls for nudity from Mrs. Robinson, which won’t surprise those familiar to the movie, which I think goes as far as ensuring something is left to the imagination. As it was, we didn’t go as far as the script required. But the whole episode got me thinking, on the subject of that lovely phrase, “artistic justification”. And, indeed, on how synonymous this might be with artistic necessity, or artistic integrity. There are differences to these, I think. I’ll try to explain.\nIn a play I did last year, Pygmalion, I grew mutton chops. Wonderful piece of terribly irritating face fuzz, if I do say so myself. It wasn’t necessary. The play never mentions my character, Pickering, as having any facial hair at all. It was, simply put, for a laugh. The director didn’t ask for it. Not necessary at all.\nWas it justified? Of course. In my opinion – a point I’ll visit later. Justified, but not necessary. These are two very different concepts in this sense. Justified, I think, because the character had to have either some facial hair, or none at all. Logic affords us no other option. If he has some, logic further stresses that it should be in some style or form. And there was nothing in the play to suggest that Pickering would not have facial hair, and ergo nothing to state its form. Within the bounds of the play – in its setting, both in time, place and society, it was a distinct possibility.\nWe can apply the same principal to The Graduate. I didn’t think Mrs. Robinson’s nudity is necessary. Again, my opinion. There would be numerous ways that could be found to circumvent the need for it without losing anything from the narrative. Logic does, however, suggest that in the hotel bedroom scene, she is either naked, or she isn’t. In that sense, is it justified? In that sense, but what of artistic integrity?\nThis is a phrase that was used by a friend of mine when I was discussing the situation with her, and one that I had not previously considered. I consider this notion to relate to whether or not we can call something art; is it done for the sake of art, or for some other means? More pertinently, is it done for the sake of the art to which it professes? Damien Hirst’s installations are often on the shocking side and are considered by many to be ghastly and anti-art. If this is his intention and if he is honest about it, then perhaps we have artistic integrity. However, if he’s suspending half a cow in formaldehyde for no other reason than some publicity and a bit of cash, then we don’t. Where we don’t have artistic integrity, we don’t have the justification. In my opinion.\nYes, I have been very opinionated, haven’t I? But my conclusion, after all my musings around this topic, is that these three notions are all subjective. For a start, they probably mean different things to different people. Even if people agree with my definitions, they may well differ in opinion to my reasons for stating if something has necessity, justification or integrity. This may come from a different view of the art form.\nSome may see a performance of The Graduate as the simple telling of a story, the actors relating a fictional tale that merely informs the audience of the relevant events. Some, however, may perceive it to be more expressive. Do they want to go for ultimate pathos and try to give the audience the same shock that Ben Braddock experiences when he first sees Mrs. Robinson disrobe? Are we trying to allow the audience a glimpse of another world from the safety of their own seat, or do we wish to ever-so-subtly take away that fourth wall and bring them, without their notice, into the story?\nThese are questions that are going to be asked again and again, and will never always be answered in the same way. But if we couldn’t be so subjective, regardless of what we do or don’t agree with, we could never call it art at all. Art is about impression as well as expression, about the challenge of producing something within given confines as much as the liberation of breaking convention – just as poetry can be strict, rhyming iambic pentameter or anarchic free verse. Take away this choice, and what you have is not art.\nHave your say!",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2010_12/content_57.html": "Retrospection\nSo, farewell then, 2010, as E. J. Thribb might say. The year has been good fun, with mostly plus points. So for those who might be interested, here’s my 2010 summed up,\nJanuary: As per the previous two years, January was pantomime month with the Washington Theatre Group. This year saw me playing the downtrodden Blue Peter in Peter Pan: The Revenge of Hook.\nFebruary: Thought I’d give ballet a try (watching, not doing), in the shape of The Nutcracker, full of music I already thought wonderful. And I’d definitely see some again.\nMarch: A trip to the South coast to see the Tiger Lillies in Brighton with Billie and Jen. I must visit Brighton again one day.\nApril: A trip to London to see the Tiger Lillies in a recorded showing of Shockheaded Peter at The V&A. The Lillies also made a trip to Durham, so I could see them without having to travel more than 20 miles.\nMay: Joined the Green Party, shortly after Caroline Lucas became their first MP. Tried vegetarianism for a week.\nJune: ROCKY HORROR! And Nigel actually remembers this one. Will wonders never cease?\nJuly: Welcome to the Jungle with the WTG, playing a couch potato and a doberman (“Strong, naturally dominant, fanatically loyal, and of course, highly intelligent” – just like me, then). One of the plays was also my inaugural attempt at directing. I’ve never been so nervous in the theatre as when that play was first performed.\nAugust: Much hilarity as a scorpion is found at the Arts Centre Washington and the place is closed for two days. Oh, for those halcyon days in Botswana when even a kid getting stung by a scorpion wouldn’t have the school closed for five minutes.\nSeptember: Plenty of theatre this month: Apples, Hairspray, The King & I and Blithe Spirit.\nOctober: Failed a driving test, but passed a stand-up comedy test after doing a turn for the Sunderland Green Party. Hopefully, it won’t be a the last.\nNovember: Performing at the Royalty in Journey’s End – great fun to do, and the moustache will live on in legend.\nDecember: Begun rehearsals of Macbeth at the Royalty, in some small but fun parts.\nBring on 2011.\nUniversity Fees\nIt’s hard to work out whether Cameron, Osborne, and Cable actually know what they’re doing or not. It wouldn’t be entirely surprising if, in their comfortable chairs in Westminster, they believe they’re doing some good, not realising that people will actually suffer from their policy on student fees, or if they’re deliberately trying to make the country more stupid.\nThat latter theory might sound absurd – but is it? A less intelligent electorate is easier to manipulate. It’s easier to mould their thoughts; to trick them into putting into power those people who’ll allow the status quo to prevail – even if the party changes. Look at Tony Blair, for instance – as right-wing as Cameron or Thatcher. Orwell anticipated such a state in 1984: “The party is not concerned with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, providing that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.”\nSuch subtle manipulation of the masses in a common theme throughout both 1984 and that other great socialist work, The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. It does sound absurd, and it may be. But we do have to consider, and be cautious of, this possibility.\nHowever, it might simply be the case that my first theory prevails – that the perpetrators of this policy simply don’t know what the effects of their policy will be. But that theory itself has a flaw in that surely nobody, particularly people who can fool a country into voting them into power, can miss the obvious: Higher fees mean fewer people in University. Fewer students mean fewer people in the jobs requiring high levels of academic skill. Ergo, we lose people with academic skills that are vital – Doctors, for instance.\nOne of Cameron’s arguments for the policy in Wednesday’s PMQs was that the current system is not fair to people who have to pay tax for university fees when they don’t go to university and don’t benefit from it. Granted, Mr. Cameron, some people don’t go to university. But everybody in this country, at one time or another, benefits from University. To take my earlier example of doctors, we’ve all had to see one at some point. There’s a good chance that many of us have had lives saved by them. This would not have been possible on a basis of A-levels, BTECs or anything else short of 20+ studies.\nSooner or later, all of the benefits of civilisation that we enjoy, and the means of production that help us to live, have come to their present state with the help of university-educated people. We are, to paraphrase Newton, living on the shoulders of giants. Newton himself was University educated – and one of the most influential academics to this day. He is one of the giants of whom I speak.\nIt would probably be folly to claim that the academically-skilled are the lifeblood of the country. We also need people with vocational skills; those skills that cannot simply be taught in the classroom. But we do also need the scholars – and to dilute the scholars is to weaken the country intellectually.\nThis might, as I’ve said, be what Cameron et al want; it may not – but that’s what they will get: a weak link in the industrialised world, where we’re meant to be one of the strongest. I can only hope the protests have some effect – otherwise, we risk having a country too stupid to realise that protest is possible. 1984 all over again.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_tag_politics/content_86.html": "Why I’m voting in – and why anyone proud to be British should do the same\nOn June 23, I think I’ll vote for the Kingdom of Northumbria to stay in the EU (the English Union).\nThere are plenty of arguments against it, and I can understand them. The English Union isn’t perfect. In Wessex, we have unelected bureaucrats, apparently making all sorts of laws that threaten our sovereignty. There’s all this talk of the money we give to London that we never get back (and both sides are probably wrong about how much that is). We have no say in some of the trade deals that Æthelstan of Wessex makes with the Normans. Some are even saying it’s Caesar’s plan B (Godwin’s Law klaxon!). And then there are all the arguments about what it does to our national identity, and the ubiquitous immigration question. But I wonder if these are problems – and if they are, then they are problems we ALREADY have within Northumbria – and nobody’s saying we should leave Northumbria because of that.\nIs the immigration thing a problem? I for one like having the opportunity to be able to move freely – to get a job in Mercia, or Kent, if I wanted to. Having that sort of freedom gives me more choice about what I can do in my life, it opens more avenues for me. It gives me more options for holidays, more cultures to learn about and to draw from, more choice of where to live and where I can bring up a family. Yes, not everyone wants the opportunity to move around – but why stop others, your own countrymen, doing that simply because you don’t wish to?\nBut people seem more concerned about others having those opportunities. They believe that if we don’t fully control our own borders, then all sorts of people – from as far away as Colchester, or Gloucester, or even Wales, can just move here and get any job they want. Why is that a bad thing? Shouldn’t we welcome new ideas and skill sets, rather than reverting to the call of “bloody foreigners, coming round here, taking our jobs”? And let’s face it, we get better takeaways (I love a good East Anglian) and it’s made it so much easier for our footballers to get international players. Before 871, who could have guessed that a small team like Pons Aelius United would ever have players from Manchester?\nWe might have unelected people in Wessex making laws for us. But that happens in our own government as well – nobody elected our Dukes and Earls. Plus, nobles of all of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms still have a say in the laws passed by England, so we still have control over what happens in our own land. We might give lots of money in taxes to London – but we give a lot to our joint capitals of Bamburgh and York – and we don’t always see that coming back. The English Union might not give us much say in trade deals – but neither does our King Eric Bloodaxe. He could make the same deals even if we were not part of England.\nAnd what of our identity – do we lose that and all suddenly become English? Well, we do become English – we are anyway – but we remain, nevertheless, Northumbrian. And Bernician. And proud citizens of our towns and villages. It doesn’t remove from our cultural identity, it adds to it. We can be proud in all of that.\nThese are the same issues that cropped up when we had that referendum for Bernicia to stay in Northumbria. People had the same concerns. But look at what good it did for the Kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira to merge and form Northumbria – trade was more transparent, there was peace in the kingdom (especially as our armies were on the same side for a change), we could move about more and get better jobs, we became this great fusion of cultures that allowed us to learn from each other, to the betterment of our civilisation, even if the government wasn’t perfect. And I strongly believe that we’ll get exactly the same benefits if we choose to remain in England.\nAnd yes, the English government may not be perfect – but neither is our own. And this is the point – what matters more, where we’re governed from, our the quality of that government? Does it matter to us more that we have a single government looking over us, able to do whatever they wish, or would we prefer that our government is kept in check by a higher authority, one who can draw from the experiences, ideals and mistakes of numerous cultures, to help (help, mind, not force) us to become a more progressive, fairer, happier state?\nI can see a time in the future when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are united into one nation – perhaps there will be a day when the seven Kingdoms aren’t even a memory – England will feel like it has always existed. And then maybe, England will merge with the other lands of this island – Scotland, Wales, Cornwall. And I wonder if there’ll ever be a time when we enter into a union with the lands across the Strait of Dover.\nI’m sure that on each of these occasions, people will have exactly the same reservations, the same arguments against. But I hope that they will see that we have gone through this, throughout history, again, and again, and again. Each time, despite what reticence there might have been, we’ve come through it as a better, stronger, more intelligent and creative nation. If this forward-looking strength in unity isn’t a British value, that we can all be proud of, then I don’t know what is. That’s why, being proud to be European, British, English, Northumbrian, Bernician and whatever else, I’m voting IN.\nThe 2015 General Election\nAbout this time in 2010, the run-up to the general election had a bit of a 1992 feel to it. Back then, when the protagonists were Kinnock and Major, was the last time that people had seriously talked about hung parliaments and coalitions. We’d had nothing of the sort since 1974, and so the idea of one party not gaining a Commons majority was, by 2010, something completely new to almost two generations of voters. In Britain, anyway – many countries in Europe have been used to them for some time. Now, it’s almost the reverse – talk of any party having a Commons majority seems like pure fantasy.\nShortly before the 2010 election, I wrote this blog post on the subject, explaining whom I was voting for (Greens in the locals, Liberal Democrats in the general) and why. On re-reading it, I noticed the following:\n…without the Green option, it [voting Lib Dem] appears to me to be the best way to try to bring some better politics into Britain – even if we get a hung parliament\nWhen I first read that, I had to laugh at how stupid that seemed, in retrospect. But then I realised it was correct, although not in the way I’d intended it to be. The political landscape has changed massively, and that (at least partially) is thanks to the Lib Dems – unfortunately it was bad politics that did so.\nThe reason for the change is easy to see. People of my age (born late seventies) will be used to seeing a major party hold onto power for at least a decade, whereby the electorate would become sick of them, and they’d vote the other major party in. The Liberal Democrats would make some gains here or there, and remain the stock protest vote. However, the coalition’s seriously bad politics have worn down the popularity of not only the senior partner in the coalition, but also the junior partner. And they can still recall how much they disliked Labour. So for once, people are looking away from even the traditional protest party. And fringe parties have become a big thing, so much so that a “rainbow coalition” is a serious possibility.\nThat, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing – a good coalition is better than a bad majority government. How successful a coalition is depends on what each partner can offer the electorate and how hard they fight for it. And this is how I’d see each of the main parties in their likely coalitions:\nThe Conservatives have been the school bullies of the coalition. They’ve picked on the weakest in society, with very little care for what their junior partners wanted. And I’ve no doubt they’d do it again. Their likely coalition partners are either the Liberal Democrats, once more, or UKIP. The former would be five more years what we’ve just had, but the latter, I think, dangerous. I can’t see UKIP being as willing to bend to Tory will as Nick Clegg’s party, and I fear that some very right-wing concessions would need to be made by the Tories to allow this coalition to happen. It could be very bad for the country.\nLabour will, I’m sure, take back votes from floating voters that they lost in 2010. But for me, they have not changed enough to be what they’re supposed to be – a party that represents the workers. If we’re to continue the school playground analogy, Ed Miliband seems to be the kid who wants to be in with the in crowd, but somehow just tries a bit too hard to be cool and likeable, and comes across as bumblingly false as a result. But even so, there’s a very good chance of a Labour/SNP coalition. Miliband has ruled this out, but I’m sure that if the job of Prime Minister hung on it, he’d take it like a shot. A coalition with the Lib Dems, or with a whole group of other parties (The Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and SDLP has been suggested) stands within the realms of possibility, but I do wonder about the possiblity of Labour/UKIP. That’s a very scary one, and could be a nail in the coffin for the party, given that its grassroots are so much more to the left than its parliamentary contingent.\nThe Liberal Democrats have spent five years being the kid who hangs out with the school bully, basking in reflected menace. The Lib Dem likes the apparent power, but has no personal power to wield – and when caught out, is always not to blame, as bigger boys made him do it. Will happily go into any coalition, but will never want to take the flak for their own spinelessness.\nUKIP – The class clown and loud-mouthed bigot, often not in the playground due to truancy. No apparent care for doing a decent job, or for the welfare of anybody not in their circle of friends. I despise this party, and I can’t see any coalition with them as being anything other than a disaster for the country.\nThe SNP, or more accurately Nicola Sturgeon, has been the star of the TV debates. In our political playground, she’s the strong-minded one that the wannabe-cool kid fancies, even though he never admits it, but we all see how glum he looks when she gets together for a group hug with her mates. It’s likely that SNP will have a landslide in Scotland, and that they’ll end up in some form of coalition with Labour. There are some saying that this could be the start of the independence debate again, and that it could ruin the Union, or that they’ll only think of Scotland, and such. Are those big problems? For one thing, I think they’re untrue. And I think a Scottish voice in Government could represent people of the North-East much better than the Lib Dems have done in the previous coalition.\nFinally, to the Greens. Many reading this blog will know I’m a member of that party. Obviously I’m biased and want you to vote for them. Many say that’s a wasted vote, I feel not. There’s every chance that if Labour gain a plurality, they’d need SNP seats as well as others to get a majority. The Greens could be part of that. Plus, I want to vote where my beliefs lie than tactically. However, I know that all of you are waiting for me to say who Natalie Bennett is in our fictional school. Natalie is the girl who might not be the most popular (although she’s recently had a massive surge in friends), but is highly intelligent and respected – although the boys won’t admit to it. They’re especially annoyed that while they were doing their PPE GCSEs, she was doing science, and therefore knows what she’s talking about. Also, she’s had a proper job, and has some actual working class integrity, which even daddy’s money can’t buy.\nYou’ll have your own views on everything, of course, and you’re well entitled to them. One thing I think we’ll all agree on, though, is that this election is very difficult to call, and should be the most exciting for a long while. But whereas last time, I said I’d vote Lib Dem but would back the Greens in spirit, this time, at least I have the choice. And that’s what’s so great about it, we all have more choice, whatever our political views.\nRuth Ellis\nJuly this year will see the 60th anniversary of the last hanging of a woman in the United Kingdom. The woman was Ruth Ellis, a London nightclub hostess, divorcée and mother of two. Her crime was murder; she shot her lover, David Blakely, four times. The crime attracted a great deal of press attention, and her death sentence provoked angry protests by those wanting abolition for the death penalty.\nAt the time, and often since, Ruth Ellis has been painted as nothing more than a jealous, cold-hearted strumpet, who shot her boyfriend – the well-to-do, promising young racing driver – in a pique of jealousy. But that is to only give a blinkered view of the situation, to not look at Ruth’s life and what might have prompted a woman – who ran a high-end nightclub, who had celebrity friends and who’d even had a minor role in a Diana Dors film – to throw away a promising future when she would have known the penalty that faced her.\nIn truth, the domestic violence that Ruth suffered at the hands of David Blakely, only the latest in a string of abusive men in her life, was a crucial side of the case that many either failed to see or chose to ignore. So too were the personal tragedies Ruth suffered in the months before the shooting, which must surely have affected a usually calm and level-headed woman in a way many of us would find hard to imagine. There’s no doubt that she committed the crime – but what we can doubt is whether the abuse and mental suffering was ever given the attention it deserved.\nIn 1955, nobody really spoke about domestic violence or mental heatlh. Even in what we like to think are enlightened modern times, people still close their eyes to them – on the rare occasions they can be seen. Ruth’s story is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\nAnd this is where the shameful plug comes in. Amanda Whittington’s play, The Thrill of Love, looks at Ruth’s story with all due sensitivity – showing, from her perspective, the troubled private life that led her to commit murder. I’m directing this play at The Royalty Theatre, Sunderland, with performances from 23rd to 28th March 2015. This paragraph might seem like cynical commercialism, but it’s an amateur production, not for profit, and for the reasons given above, it’s a story I believe needs to be told. Please come along if you can.\nThe Scottish Referendum\nThe Scottish Referendum interests me greatly. My generation of fellow Englanders has only usually seen borders rearranged from a distance; they’re something that usually only happens to ex-Communist nations and war-torn parts of former empires. So it’s a breath of fresh air to see this happening close to home – in fact, only about 50 or 60 miles from my home.\nFrom a moral point of view, I think it’s the right thing to do. The Scots should all have a chance to air their preferences, and the majority preference should be honoured, whatever that is. Personally, were I Scottish and had a vote, I’d probably vote yes – for the opportunity to have a government that’s more likely to understand me, my culture and my heritage. A number of people have suggested that all in the British Isles should have a vote, which I can understand, but having no Scottish heritage that I know of, I’d feel as though I were interfering by exercising that vote.\nThat aside, I’m looking forward to seeing what would change if we did vote yes. For instance, what would happen to the title of “Duke of Edinburgh”, and indeed its present holder? We’re told that we’d keep the Union Flag in its present form, but then we’d have a flag that represents Scotland, but not Wales. When Gibraltar come over to play Scotland in European Championship qualifiers, the Mediterraneans will be my compatriots, and the Scots the foreigners. Bizarre.\nWould I need a passport to get to the Edinburgh Festival? How would that sit for Berwick Rangers’ travelling army of supporters? I’m told by a Shetlander that Shetlanders don’t consider themselves Scottish, and that there are some who would prefer being part of Norway (that being closer) in the event of a yes vote. At the very least, English barmen may no longer have to listen to cries of, “but it’s legal tender” when being offered a Scottish banknote.\nMy fear, however, is that people don’t listen to their own heads and hearts when deciding which way to vote. It’s not your standard election for a regime that will only last four or five years; it’s to all intents a lasting choice. Whether you think Salmond or Cameron is the right person to represent you is of no consequence – odds are in ten years neither will be any great shakes. Twenty, fifty, a hundred years down the line, even less so. Arguments about how good/bad either choice will be for the economy are specious – politicians have loved to use such arguments in recent years, hoping that there are enough people who don’t understand economics who’ll simply take their word for it. Even if either vote has a bad effect on the economy, that won’t last forever, and I repeat – this is a vote for the long term, not the short term, which ever way you vote. I really don’t want this to end like the AV referendum – bad politics on both sides, which leaves many voters confused and undecided, and simply voting for the devil they know, or abstaining altogether.\nThe short-term parliamentary impact is nevertheless another interesting aspect. Scotland currently has 59 Westminster MPs – 41 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 6 Scottish National Party and a lone Conservative. Should a yes vote come through, independence would only happen in March 2016. If Labour win the general election in 2015, odds are that their Scottish MPs would make up a large part of their majority. It’s therefore possible that ten months into a new government, we’d need another general election – something which, again, few of my generation have ever seen.\nSo I’m supporting a yes vote, more for the moral reasons, but also from a sort of morbid curiosity. But I think it’s more important that people have a good think about their choice, whatever it is, and understand that it should be about Scotland’s WHOLE future, not merely about the next few years. Because that’s just voting for your own interests, and not for your country’s – whatever you consider your country to be.\nNelson Mandela\nFebruary 11th, 1990, 16:15 (GMT+2), I know where I was. Because it was a major, major event – in my part of the world somewhat more than most. Being only 11 at the time, I didn’t quite understand why, or who this person really was. All I’d had to go on was what little I’d been told about him and the group he’d worked for, and that wasn’t terribly flattering to him.\nMy family had moved to South Africa when I was three. From what I can remember of the first few years there, I was aware that there were white people, and that there were black people. I was vaguely aware that there was little interaction between the two. At the two nursery schools I attended, there were no black children. I think there were black menial staff at those places, but no black teachers. I would see black people in the street, though never seemingly as affluent as white people. My family had a black maid for a time – it was not at all unusual for white people to have black domestic staff. This was what Apartheid created – not merely a system of racial segregation, but a racialised class system, too.\nIn March 1985, we moved north of the border to Botswana. In Botswana, there was not even a sign of apartheid. In fact, the first President of that country, Seretse Khama, had been exiled from the country in the early 50s when it was still the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland, for the “crime” of marrying a white woman he’d met while studying at Oxford. The South Africans had complained to the British about the marriage. Britain, not wishing to compromise mineral trading with the South Africans, weakly submitted to the complaint. Thankfully, the exile lasted only five years.\nBut the inequality between black and white that I saw in South Africa was simply not there in Botswana – the black and white stripes on the country’s flag, in fact, are there to symbolise that very equality. There was still something of a racial class system – the white ex-patriates tended to be the more affluent and have the better jobs – but wealth and power were by no means the preserve of the whites. The country, and indeed the town, were run by native Batswana people. Before moving there, I recall my parents telling me that there would be black and white students in my school, which seemed like an odd thing at the time – something I hadn’t experienced. But we got there, and sure enough – black and white kids running around the playground not really caring (for the most part) whether their playmates were black or white. The only separation was languages – when the white kids went off to learn Afrikaans, the Batswana kids went off to learn their first language, Setswana.\nSo on that day in February 1990, I think I’d only known what apartheid was for a short period of time; maybe less than a year. If memory serves, we’d all known that this Mandela guy was going to be released in the run up to it, and I’d only known his name for a matter of weeks, maybe days. And all I knew of him was that he was a terrorist with the African National Congress. I’m not sure if I understood why such a person was being released. But there I was, watching a major event in African history, from the living room floor of D66, Tshkudu Crescent, EU III, Jwaneng, Botswana. An event that was to cause all sorts of turmoil in South Africa, until it seemed to settle (to a degree) in 1994, when Mandela became President.\nAs the years have gone, of course, I’ve grown older and gained a greater understanding of what happened in South Africa over those years. The world at large has come to see Mandela as less of a terrorist and more of a figurehead of a civil rights movement – and that includes me. Not everybody has this opinion, of course. I have to say that being a person who disagrees with terrorist methods (which I’ll loosely define as political violence against civilian rather than military targets), this does cause some conflict with me. The terrorist vs. freedom fighter debate is an old one, and you’ll all have your own views about which category Mandela falls into.\nFor my part, I don’t believe that what he did with Umkhonto we Sizwe was right, even if as a means to justify an end. But does that mean that I should ignore what he’s done since his release from prison? His leadership of the civil rights movement that smashed apartheid and brought some equality to South Africa, his charity work, his role in international diplomacy? Of course not. After all, other figures in history have done much worse, and for some reason still have a pristine press to the majority. There was, for instance, the genocidal maniac who, in a fit of impatience, decided to indiscriminately slaughter 2,700 men, women and children after the fall of Acre in 1189. Nowadays, we call that person “Richard the Lionheart”.\nAs such, all of the tributes paid to Mandela since his death are not unjustified – though I get the impression that some are purely for show. It would be wrong for history to forget why he was put in prison, but it would also be wrong to forget what he did after he was finally released. So let us remember him for the good that he did, but likewise, let us learn from his mistakes, and try to quosh oppression by non-violent means where there’s even a chance it’s possible.\nFlipping Genders\nSo first, this excellent article on gender-flipping.\nSecondly, a comment on it (or on part of it) from a male friend (entirly copied and pasted, his errors):\nReally!? Are you surprised that male super heros are drawn to me masculine and powerful? While female super heros are shown to be sexy and agile?\nThere just exaggerated traits of the generic male and female traits, men and woman are NOT equal, they both have strengths that lie in different places. Other wise the Olympics would not need to spilt the two sexs up.\nYes there is a minority of ppl that are mixed up, girl in mans body or what ever you want to refer to it as, and that’s fine. But it does not mean that we should draw all the super heros as homo guys and masculine females.\nI had a lot to counter this with, so I thought a blog would be better. Here goes.\nFirstly, no, I’m not surprised – for reasons I’ll come to later.\nSecondly, we’re talking about superheroes. The concept of unequal gender strength went out of the window at the start. Put Supergirl up against Arnie in a weightlifting contest, I’m fairly sure that only a Kryptonite-spiked protein shake is going to prevent a female winner there.\nThirdly, even ignoring its clear indelicacy, the final sentence really misses the point. Because the point of this whole article, not just the bits about superheroes, is that flipping the genders in this way can illustrate a very good point. It’s about showing a logical fallacy by reversing something very familiar, so that in the unfamiliar form, we can see it better for what it is. Really, it’s no different from Orwell showing what problems might lie in revolutionary socialism by turning the Soviet Union into an animal farm.\nThe superhero part of the article demonstrates this sort of reversal allegory very well. It highlights just how much female superheroes seem to have two functions – not just fighting the forces of evil, but looking damn hot as well. The fellas, meanwhile, need only be concerned with fighting the baddies. This is the point – to highlight both the gender imbalance and the subliminal women-are-only-valid-when-they’re-hot message.\nTo go back to my first point, the imbalance isn’t suprising because it has been this way in the superhero world for years. Superman gets to cover his legs up, whereas Supergirl has a very short skirt which, really, cannot allow for much modesty when taking off for a quick fly. The Hulk is stocky and unlikely to get a job as an underwear model, whereas She-Hulk is leggy, with fantastic hair and improbable breasts. Reed Richards is allowed a flash of white hair; his better half has to look like she’s just walked out of her teens. The 1983 Spider-Woman annual sees her alter-ego getting out of the shower with only a small towel to cover her front – when would we see the same of Peter Parker? And later in the annual when she’s fighting the Hulk, you seem to see more of her arse than her face. Surely a female superhero should be written and drawn to show a powerful woman, not a powerful woman who, it is suggested, is only any good because she has curves in all of the regulatory places?\nIt’s an imbalance that could very much do with redressing. But in closing, a word to my friend: A woman not being actively sexy does not equal masculine. A man being feminine does not equal homosexual. And a person with trans- feelings does not equal mixed up. Whatever points you might have in arguments on such topics, such equations are never going to win many admirers.\nPaulo di Canio…and Feminism?\nThe whole fascism furore surrounding Paolo di Canio had kind of died down now, partly because of his public statement that he isn’t fascist (and we’ll all have our own opinions on that), and partly because Sunderland are now winning games, so that obviously makes everything okay. But this weekend, a (female) friend of mine voiced a very interesting opinion on the subject that’s made me see the whole thing from quite a different angle.\nBut before I treat you to these words of wisdom, let’s be clear what we mean by fascism: In simple terms, it’s an authoritarian ideology that puts the state and its ruling class at the top of society. Anyone not congruent with that is treated as an inferior, even subhuman. That might be on the basis of religion, race, sex, sexuality, hair colour, political preference or favourite type of cheese. Often, it’ll be a mix of them. But at its heart, it’s an ideology that excludes people simply because they’re different to others in some way.\nHappy with that? Good. Now, I’m going to have to paraphrase what my friend said, mostly because at the time of this discussion, I must admit that I’d made a useful contribution to Sunderland’s pub trade. But the basic gist of her statement was, “Why should I care if di Canio is fascist, when the sport is exclusionist anyway?”\nFootball? Exclusionist? Ha’way, we have all sorts of peope in the Beautiful Game, at the top level, don’t we? All faiths, all races, most likely all sexualities, all genders, all…hang on.\nYup, that’s something perfectly obvious when you think about it, but for some reason, it never occurred to me. Gotta love that Y-chromosome. Football is almost entirely exclusionist (at least at what you might call its upper echelons) when it comes to women. Granted, we have the odd woman in the boardroom (as indeed Sunderland do), we have assistant referee Sian Massey, and we have the odd female TV presenter, but beyond that – no female players, managers, coaches, referees, even physios, from what I can tell (correct me if I’m wrong, please). I can even recall a situation at university, where the Students’ Union wanted to arrange a charity football match of mixed-sex teams. But apparently, the referee’s union (or whomever) refused to send someone to a mixed-sex match. I can’t think of a practical reason why that might be so – if you can, please educate me.\nArmed with this knowledge, it seems odd that we might find it distasteful if a manager is appointed who might not have a liking for some minority group, when the game itself excludes about 50% of the population to start with. And here’s the odd thing: If a manager were to be appointed to a Premier League team, and that person were to publically state, say, that Muslims should not be allowed to play football, but women should, he’d be castigated by all and sundry, despite his stance being more inclusive than the game is currently.\nThe situation isn’t going to stop me enjoying football by any means. But it’ll make me feel a bit hypocritical if I vent spleen at one form of discrimination, while tolerating another more widespread one. To enjoy the game I may have to tolerate both – in a perfect world, I wouldn’t have to – but at least I know I have to tolerate something, rather than unconsciously accepting it as the status quo.\nAlan Turing’s Centenary\nHe might have been 100 this coming weekend. You may or may not know who he is, but he was undoubtedly one of the most influential people of the 20th Century. And his demise is perhaps one of the most tragic, given his treatment in his later life over a simple matter of personal taste, despite all that he had done for the world. He was the Olivier, the Shakespeare, the Elvis, the Pele, the Leonardo Da Vinci of computer science. And yet, this counted for nothing, simply because he fancied blokes.\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in Maida Vale on June 23rd, 1912. Consider the technology of the day. Commercial flights were a year and a half away. The Titanic had sunk just two months earlier. Edison was the Spielberg of the day. No TV, just radio. Nearly sixty years would pass before the world saw the pocket calculator. Just 100 years ago, it was primitive by modern standards. He showed a great aptitude for mathematics and physics as a youngster, being able to understand Einstein’s theories by the age of sixteen.\nHe is most famous, however, for his work at Bletchley Park. It was here, during World War II, that he played a major role in cracking the Enigma code. Indeed, he is generally credited with the invention of the bombe – a huge machine that performed most of the mechanical functions required to crack the code. For many people, he’s the man who won the war for the Allies – more so than Churchill, RJ Mitchell, Dowding or Eisenhower. Aside from this, he made numerous advances in cryptography, mathematics and computer science. Today he’s considered the father of computer science.\nBut none of this made any difference when, in 1952, he confessed to a homosexual relationship after a partner had tried to break into his house. Homosexuality being illegal at the time, he was convicted for gross indecency. His punishment? They gave him a choice, bless them. Imprisonment, or chemical castration – oestrogen administered to inhibit libido. It killed his career, and probably killed him. On June 8, 1954, his mother found his body. He had died the previous day due to cyanide poisoning, probably in a suicide. An apple found next to him suggested that he’d killed himself in a manner derived from his favourite fairy tale – Snow White.\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown has since given a public apology for his treatment (though none for other people treated in the same way, prominent or not). But this cannot re-write history. To paraphrase Churchill, never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to one man, yet never has such a debt been so badly ignored. Hyperbole, perhaps – but the discrepancy is nonetheless a serious blot on our country’s human rights record.\nBut he left a legacy that we’ve exploited well. Without his work, you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. Without the advances that he made, the less prominent people in society have a greater voice. When Jan Moir of the Daily Mail published her repugnant, homophobic article on the death of Stephen Gately (here’s Charlie Brookers’ wondrously scathing riposte to it), the response from the huddled masses was such that companies withdrew adverts from the paper and website wholesale. The very prejudices that blighted Turing’s later life had successfully been challenged, largely thanks to his own work. I think he’d have been delighted to know that he’d have that effect.\nHis life ended in disgrace. Thankfully, in these more enlightened times, he’s seen as a hero, and not a lewd pervert who just happened to have tastes the government didn’t like. And for the sake of humanity, let’s hope he remains that hero.\nPoetry in School\nDagnab it, I have to agree with a Tory politician on something. In this case, it’s Education Secretary Michael Gove’s proposal that children in schools should be learning poetry by heart. I think it’s a good idea.\nIt won’t by any means solve all that is wrong with our education system – you’d need many, many more good ideas for that, and a government who actually cares about it (as well as educators, rather than politicians, defining the curriculum). And it’s not the most important aspect of education. Basic English certainly needs addressing. Maths are important. Languages, sciences and humanities are all vital. Poetry, many would argue, is not as important as these.\nAnd I would agree with that. In many ways, poetry is a trivial thing. Like any art form, it’s often something that we use purely to entertain us, rather than to educate us. This doesn’t mean, however, that it cannot have a good effect on us. The benefits that occur to me are as follows.\nFirstly, memorising stuff is good exercise for the mind. I’m an actor and often have to memorise lines and speeches, as well as cues and actions. As a crossword solver, I have to remember the numerous constructs that setters use. As a computer programmer, I have to remember functional and technical procedures, as well as commands. The brain might be an organ, but it’s like a muscle in the sense that the more it gets exercised, the fitter it will be. It doesn’t have to be poetry – it could be lists of stuff – but if we are to exercise children’s mind with memory feats, why not use a medium that’ll entertain?\nThat brings me to my next point. School is boring. Quadratic equations, French verbs, angles of incidence and refraction – school is full of stuff that doesn’t immediately pique the interest of children. So what’s wrong with introducing something that help to relieve the boredom, and entertains whilst doing the child some good? Of course, the poetry itself would have to be relevant and entertaining. I positively despised having to deconstruct Marvell’s To His Coy Mistress at the age of 14/15 – couldn’t understand what the Hell he was on about.\nThere are probably numerous other benefits that I haven’t bothered to think of. But I doubt it’d have any adverse effect. It certainly hasn’t done me any harm – memorising poetry was often part of my homework when I was 10, in school in Botswana (“I’ll race / To the place / Where Grace / Sells lace / And warm my face / By the fireplace” – that was the first one I learnt, about 24 years ago). And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.",

And now, as I’ve pointed out above, my memory serves me well in numerous endeavours. I’m no brain scientist, of course, so I can’t say if those poems learnt as a kid have significantly contributed to that. There’s always the chance, though.\nEuro 2012 and Racism\nThe main element of bad press for Euro 2012 at the moment is racism. Not so much the whole John Terry/Rio Ferdinand story (personally, I’d have left both of them out of the squad; they’re past it now in my opinion); more the attitudes of the Polish and Ukrainian supporters. Racist attitudes, that is, of the sort that hasn’t been seen (to any great extent, at least) in English football since the 80s.\nAmong the numerous stories, we have players saying that they, or their whole teams, will leave the pitch if they receive racist abuse. We have Michel Platini stating that players will be booked if they do that (I believe that referees can book players for leaving the pitch without permission anyway). He’s had his critics for this, as one might expect – such a stance will always look soft on racism. But I’m not entirely sure that leaving the pitch (or indeed the entire tournament, as some have suggested) is the right thing to do. Let me explain.\nI’ll try to put this in some perspective first. Footballers will always, rightly or wrongly, receive abuse from fans. Indeed, I dished some out in my last blog post (though I would hope it’s taken as being tongue-in-cheek). And it needn’t be racist abuse. It might be to do with nationality, height, (perceived) sexuality, religion, weight, hair colour, criminal convictions, their invented illegitimacy, anything. Race is just one of these things. It just so happens that, for whatever reason, the general public in this country are more sensitive to racial abuse than to other forms – even though other forms of abuse can be taken to heart to the same extent that racism can be.\nBecause racism is seen to be worse, a footballer can be banned for numerous matches because of a racist taunt (as Luis Suárez was, for eight games, this season). But I’ve yet to see a player banned for any other sort of taunt to another player, and you’d have to be a fool to think that it doesn’t happen. Fans, too, can get bans or criminal convictions for racist abuse, but not for other forms. Players will make official complaints where racial taunting goes on, but again, not for other forms of abuse. On those occasions, they’d be expected to not let the abuse get to them, and to carry on the game as normal – whether the abuse comes from players or fans.\nIn my opinion, that’s the right attitude to take – don’t let it get to you. As children, we’re taught mantras such as “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We’re told to disregard bullies, as a reaction is exactly what they want. The racism problem of Euro 2012 is simply playground bullying writ large. Those handing out the abuse (who were probably the bullies in the playground, and probably haven’t grown up much since), whether players or fans, are looking for a reaction. They want to disrupt the rightful order of things for their own entertainment or gain. By giving a reaction, the racists are getting what they want. And if games are abandoned, we’d be punishing innocent people – those fans who have spent large amounts of flights, hotels, tickets, et cetera. The racists have their fun, the true fans lose their money and a chance to see their team, and the sports stars deny themselves their right to compete at the highest level in the continent. How can this be right in any way?\nThe point is this. Platini’s stance makes it sound like he wants to ignore racism entirely (and he might – I don’t exactly know him personally). But there’s a difference between ignoring something, and not allowing it to affect you. Teams certainly cannot ignore racism – but they can keep a cool head, maintain the moral high ground, and not allow the bastards to grind them down. The complaints can be made after the game, and we’d have to trust UEFA (I know that might be difficult) to mete out punishments to the FAs or clubs involved (as they did with Liverpool after the Heysel disaster). Theoretically, that should see the right people punished – not the true fans or the players.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_12/content_168.html": "Retrospection\nNo plays performed in front of major international stars this year, but you can’t have everything. Still, a lot of good stuff to look back upon.\nJanuary: Back to panto action, with the Washington Theatre Group, in Dick Whittington, playing the Sultan of Morocco in a fabulous Fez.\nFebruary: Trip to Liverpool for the Green Party conference and some tourism.\nMarch: About forty different birthday booze-ups for Nigel’s 40th. Seemed like that anyway.\nApril: Performed in a very memorable play, Keeping Tom Nice at The Royalty, playing a social worker. Took a trip into Darkest Yorkshire, too – somehow returning with a lot of beer.\nMay: Trip to London for a birthday. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that cake. I think I winced when the knife went in. Any man would. That should give you an idea of what shape it was.\nJune: Attempted a weekend break in Grizedale, but rain contrived to have half the campsite flooded. Despite this, a memorable trip if only for that wonderful game pie at the Eagle’s Head – the highlight of the 13-hour holiday. Performed this poem at the launch event for the Middlesbrough Literary Festival.\nJuly: A second camping trip, this time around the Northumbrian Coast, proved more successful. Great weather all over the place, and the fish and chips from Beadnell Bay are highly recommended.\nAugust: Took part in an anti-NF demo in Sunderland. The star of the NF show was the guy in the Chelsea shirt with “Essien” on the back. Michael Essien, a black foreigner, an immigrant with a job. Love the logic there.\nSeptember: Highlight of the year: The North-East Skinny Dip. Yes, jumping in the North Sea at 7 in the morning is the best thing that happened to me this year. Believe it or else. Flag bearer at Sunderland Pride, too. And interviewed by the same Sky reporter and both events.\nOctober: Unexpectedly found myself performing in The Edge of Darkness at The Royalty after an actor had to drop out due to illness on the final night. Scary experience, and an ironic one – I’m the smartarse who always knows his lines first, and I had to do the entire performance with a script.\nNovember: Started archery lessons with Whitburn Archers.\nDecember: Directing The Day after the Fair. Coming to a theatre near you soon. If you’re near The Royalty.\nRoll on 2013.\nDesert Island Albums\nOne problem with the whole desert-island-whatever thing is that, if you knew you were going to be stranded, possibly for years, with only about ten records, books, or whatever, you’d have to be pragmatic. Although the idea is that you choose your favourite ten, common sense would suggest otherwise. You’d probably want a bit of variety. You might be a big Led Zeppelin fan, for instance, but surely, for the whole time you were stuck on that island, you wouldn’t want all nine of their studio albums plus a compilation. You’d want something different on occasion. II and IV would probably suffice, possibly with Physical Graffiti if you didn’t think you could live without Kashmir.\nSo, this list of albums isn’t necessarily my 10 favourites. It’s probably closer to a list of favoured artists. I’ve made a few rules for this: firstly, no compilation albums. Greatest Hitses, Very Best Ofs and Now That’s What I Calls all feel a bit like cheating here. Secondly, no box sets, as they similarly feel like they don’t hit the spirit of the thing.\nAnd I’m going to limit it to ten this time. When I did Desert Island Books, I ended up with fourteen. This time, I’ll name ten, but I’ll have some in reserve. The reserves will be those that, should I find myself about to be stranded on a desert island with my record collection in front of me, I’d take if any of the main ten couldn’t be found. That seems fair. So, in no particular order:\nGeneration Terrorist – Manic Street Preachers\nFor those poor souls who think the Manics’ career began when A Design For Life made it big, let me educate you on something. That single was from their fourth album – which saw the beginning of the band’s slow collapse into nice commercial tunes. Before that, much of their creative genius came from Richey Edwards – a man often described as “troubled” by the press (not without cause – look up the 4 REAL incident), and who is now missing, presumed dead. And this first album might surprise those who so loved the strings and nice, friendly, pop guitars of their Everything Must Go offering. Because it’s brash, and full of anti-establishment sentiment. Motorcycle Emptiness will always be its best-known track, but You Love Us and Little Baby Nothing are right up there with it.\nA Night at the Opera – Queen\nEven if Greatest Hitses were allowed, this would still come in front of any of Queen’s compilations, for me. It was the album that gave us Bohemian Rhapsody (everybody’s favourite headbanging-in-cars tune), You’re My Best Friend and the questionable I’m in Love with my Car. But even these won’t stand out to everyone as the best – Death on Two Legs is wonderfully angry, and will probably remind you of every boss you ever hated. The Prophet’s Song is the ultimate murder-ballad, being eerie and apocalyptic. To counter these, we have the more jolly Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendezvous. It’s hard to imagine an album with a greater variety (especially as Bo-Rap itself has about six musical genres in one song). There’s not a bad track on the whole album, and to add to its brilliance, Brian May even plays ukulele on Good Company.\nMonster – R.E.M.\nNow then.\nTo my mind, this is the finest album ever made. And it will always remain so. No arguments, final word, no phoning a friend. Many will disagree – there were numerous music critics who thought that because it didn’t have the mainstream appeal of Out of Time or Automatic for the People, it wasn’t worth bothering about. Morons, I say. It’s certainly rockier than the previous two offerings, but hey, good bands should always be versatile. Crush with Eyeliner is my stand-out track, a gorgeous anti-love ballad, if that makes any sense. We have the better-known What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?, probably the only song ever based on a line shouted at a CBS anchorman by someone assaulting him with a bat. We have the lovely falsetto Tongue, Strange Currencies and number of other songs on themes of love, sex and identity, all as grungy and decadent as a diesel cheesecake. Buy it, now.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars – David Bowie\nSo many Bowie albums to choose from, that I would be tempted to break the Greatest Hits rule. But if I had to pick one, it’d be this long-titled offering from the King of Glam. Even the cover of the LP is iconic, our Dave in his glam gear in Heddon Street, London. Ziggy Stardust, one of my favourite Bowie tracks, is the best on this album, but it’s in good company with Suffragette City and Starman – who can forgot the controversy this song caused when Bowie sang it on Top of the Pops, having the audacity to put his arm around Mick Ronson WHEN KIDS MIGHT BE WATCHING. What sick filth, call the Daily Mail immediately. Before house prices drop or this blog gives you cancer.\nTwo Penny Opera – The Tiger Lillies\nA little-known band, but one with a worldwide following, and probably the band I’ve seen live the most. This is just one of the nigh-on thirty albums of theirs so far. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who might be easily offended, or might want to play the record in front of children, churchgoers or potential employers – especially if you’re after a Sunday School job. Irreverent is understating it. Mary is a catchy tune about a young lady who’ll pleasure any manner of churchman, including God himself. Piss on Your Grave at least gives an idea of its content through the title. Your Suicides brings some humour to the darkness, which is quite typical of the Lillies’ music – the darker subjects of life explored with a libertarian humour. Don’t take it too seriously, unless you’re the sort of person who’d buy it just to be offended, so that you could write to someone about it.\nFuzzy Logic – Super Furry Animals\nA band that were never as A-list as Blur or Oasis during the 90s Britpop years, but with more creativity that the two of those put together. But I’ve seen staplers with more creativity than Oasis, anyway. Fusing guitar rock with electronic music, the Welsh five-piece’s debut is grungy, snappy and fun. Unfortunately, it has none of their Welsh-language pieces which can be so much fun, but it does have the sprightly Something 4 the Weekend, Frisbee and Bad Behaviour. In contrast, If You Don’t Want Me To Destroy You is smoothly poetic. Gruff Rhys has a fabulous, erm, gruff voice that suits the balladeering as well as it does the grunge – this makes sense, as I don’t think you’re allowed to be Welsh if you can’t sing.\nGet a Grip – Aerosmith\nAerosmith have been around for a good long while – in fact, almost as long as Newcastle United’s trophy drought, which is saying something. But I know them best from the mid-90s, when they were the Classic Rock band du jour. They’re the best band I’ve yet seen live, and another act for whom I’d be more tempted by a compilation. But studio album it must be, and this is the finest that I’ve come across from them. We have the ballads – Crazy and Crying (who can forget those Alicia Silverstone videos, eh?) – and the rockier tunes: Livin’ on the Edge and Shut up and Dance are here, as is the vitriolic Eat the Rich – one assumes the band had been reduced to a squat in Boston, MA when they were recording this, living on bread and water. It’s what classic rock music should be – loud, upbeat and performed by blokes older than your dad who have no right to be cool at their age.\nThe Bends – Radiohead\nFamed for their ability to be soul-destroyingly depressing, Radiohead’s second album doesn’t quite live up to such hyperbole. It’s an outstanding album that, while it might make you a bit melancholy sometimes, and others it’ll make you nice and angry. Not one for the wedding disco, then – save it for the inevitable divorce party. Just stands out as the finest of the angrier tunes, and it’s worth seeing the video just so you can go “eh?” and the end bit. Street Spirit (Fade Out) calms everything down to finish to album. The singles High and Dry, Fake Plastic Tree and My Iron Lung are present and correct, but these are by no means the only worthy tracks. All of them are worthy. Of your attention.\nSergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band – The Beatles\nBefore I go any further, anyone who had to be told that this album was by the Beatles should go away now, preferably somewhere cold (like the further reaches of the Horsehead Nebula) and never come back, for it is an abomination to the LORD (i.e., John Lennon – ALWAYS bigger than Jesus). It has almost become acknowledged as a fact that it’s the best album of John, Paul, George and Ringo, as so many people subscribe to this theory. With good cause, too. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! When I’m 64! Lovely Rita! With a Little Help from my Friends! Many more besides! Another one with a classic album cover, and probably the most iconic of the fab four’s albums – perhaps more so that Abbey Road, and with less chance of people getting run over trying to imitate it.\nThriller – Michael Jackson\nThe album that won more Grammy awards than one and three-quarter camels have legs. Really stuck for a simile there. Eight awards, and I’m certain that at least three of those were for letting Vincent Price have a go at the creepy voice on the title track. There were seven singles on this album, so I’ve missed a great opportunity for the simile I was looking for earlier. Billie Jean is the song that gave us the Moonwalk, and Beat It is that song that (possibly) gave us “Weird Al” Yankovic parodies. It doesn’t quite fit with the rock/indie theme that’s been developing in the list, but Michael Jackson was the first musician I was ever enthusiastic about. And this is his best album, without a doubt. It even has a Beatle on it, in The Girl is Mine. McCartney should be honoured that he’s in two of these albums. And it’s a great choice for a desert island, because you can practice your zombie dancing to it without anyone watching. Who wouldn’t want that?\nSo, that’s the ten. But the reserves? No detailed description, just the basics, and some of the better tracks. Find them on Spotify or something, and enjoy…\nAttack of the Grey Lantern – Mansun : Stripper Vicar, Egg-Shaped Fred, Wide Open Space.\nAutomatic for the People – R.E.M. : Ignoreland, Find the River, Everybody Hurts.\n1977 – Ash : Girl from Mars, Oh Yeah, Goldfinger.\nScream, Dracula, Scream – Rocket from the Crypt : Ball Lightning, Heater Hands, On a Rope.\nSweet Sixteen – The Fureys : The Siege of a Nation, The Green Fields of France, Yesterday’s Men.\nHow to Make Friends and Influence People – Terrorvision : Pretend Best Friend, Oblivion, Middleman.",

Provided they aren’t wasps (pointless animals if ever there were any), but on the whole, niceness to animals is a good thing and should be encouraged. Banal, unthinking sentimentality, however, is a different kettle of obsolete metaphor.\nThere are seabirds aplenty in Sunderland. Possibly as many to humans as there were Zulus to Welsh Guards in Zulu. Some of these live around my flat (often waking me up by banging their silly heads against the window), and it’s not uncommon at this time of year to see very young ones, who’ve yet to pass their flying test and still waddle around on the ground a lot. The smaller ones are quite cute, in a strikingly ugly sort of way.\nRecently, there have been a couple of these waddling about along my garden path. But somebody in one of the lower flats appears to think that they’ve been orphaned, despite the proliferation of older birds that appear to be keeping an eye on them (giving you the impression, every time you pass by the young ‘uns, that they’re going to remake The Birds on yo’ ass if you so much as think about harming junior).\nIn a move which might make conclusion jumping a new Olympic sport, this person has put a box outside the front door, and set inside it an old blanket and some straw. And a nice little bowl of water in case it gets thirsty. Aww, how sweet!\nYes, the thought is quite lovely. It’s just a shame that that was the person’s only thought (possibly the only one for a long time). And because this person could not realise that it was clearly being looked after by other birds, I now have to negotiate my way past a box on my way out, avoiding seven shades of seagull shit into the bargain, whilst also making sure that I don’t stand on any of the little darlings in the process.\nThe morbid irony of it, is that to the neighbourhood cats this might be like a new KFC opening. I’m hoping this won’t be the case.",
  "http_oddbodd13_wordpress_com/https_oddbodd13_wordpress_com_2012_04_02_las-malvinas-son-whose/content_77.html": "Las Malvinas son….whose?\nLas Malvinas/The Falklands have recently been in the press quite a bit, mostly due to the 30th Anniversary of the Argentinian attempted liberation/invasion. Probably hyperbole drummed up by the presses of both bald men involved, but nonetheless, their disputed comb has once again become the focus of “tensions”, as the popular press likes to put it, between Britain and Argentina. I’ve heard a fair bit of opinion on the social networks regarding this – particularly comments about how the Falklands are “ours” (i.e., British) and that Argentina should leave them well alone. Now I’m going to put my two penn’orth in for the sake of a healthy argument.\nBut let us clarify the facts of the case first. The Falkland Islands are a group of 778 rocks in the South Atlantic, two of which are somewhat bigger than the rest. As far as can be ascertained, they have no indigenous human population. Therefore, when people first decided to go there – whether those people were indigenous South Americans, British, Portuguese, Spanish, Pixie or Martian – they would not have had to subjugate a race to claim the islands as their own. And as Human Nature tends toward the finders-keeper-losers-weepers doctrine of possession, whether or not you agree with that, it would be easy to see that whoever got there first, they would naturally feel that the islands were “theirs”.\nAnother fact is that nobody really knows who did get there first. The best guess for a European nation is either the English, the Spanish or the Portuguese, who were all doing sterling jobs of colonising and subjugating all over the Americas. Of course, There’s nothing to say that South Americans wouldn’t have gone there before that. As it was, the British gained control of the islands in 1833. But does that mean they have the rightful claim to it?\nOne of the arguments I’ve seen on Facebook is that “Argentina was not even a country in 1833”. Now, let’s get another fact clear. A country is simply an area of the globe with defined borders and and its own government, whose jurisdiction is (usually) confined to the aforementioned borders. But there was surely no rule-book ever written that stated that a person must be from an official country before he or she can claim or use any land they happened to find. So that argument is entirely superfluous. However, the modern argument over “ownership” is not so much about who saw them first. The British, although they may not have discovered the islands, have gained control of them. Most people living there now are of British descent, and wish to remain British Citizens (so why did they leave Britain, I wonder). One might think that it would be reasonable to allow that.\nHowever, the Argentinian side is also understandable. The islands are a shorter distance from Argentina as Edinburgh is from London (oddly, despite David Cameron being keen on keeping Scotland under the yoke of England, the similar distance doesn’t make him see the Falklands situation the same way). The islands are nowhere near England. Any suggestion that it would make good sense for Argentina to govern the islands is not without its merit. After all, if you’d just moved house and had nowhere to park but the street, you’d feel aggrieved if the spot outside your house was used by someone who lived miles away. Proximity is not a factor that we can ignore.\nSo what would I do? Frankly, I wouldn’t make a fuss over them. I don’t know what it is that the Falklands provides Britain with, apart from the odd funny-looking coin that’s a novelty for precisely five seconds. The bald men fighting over a comb analogy is perfectly right. Why do we even bother?\nPerhaps it’s because certain elements of our septic isle still have not grown out of Imperialism. Britain’s insistence that the islands are ours-and-you-can’t-have-them seems childish in this egalitarian, global age of ours. The whole situation puts me in mind of the child in the playground who threatens to take his ball home if things don’t go his way.\nSo I say, let’s just forget about the Falklands. To those who feel that they’re “ours” and would want to send troops in to defend them from Argentina, let me ask you this: Just how much do you think your life would change if we dispensed with them? Would your pay-packet drop? Would tax rise? Would the Internet break? Would electricity stop working? Would all waterways on Earth suddenly turn into camembert, killing life on the planet forever? Of course not. For the overwhelming majority, nothing would change. So why do you wish to keep them so much?\nChris said,\nApril 2, 2012 at 12:19 pm\nThe Falklands War was more about the military junta in Argentina holding on to power than anyone actually wanting the islands. President Galtieri needed a war to keep the head of the the Argentinian navy on-side and his military “dictatorship” in office. That was a damn good reason to fight to keep them in my opinion.\nFast forward to today, and now there’s very little reason to give them up. “Because Argentina wants them” is not a reason to displace the people who live there. Plus, while they might be ‘just a bunch of rocks in the sea’, there are several oil exploration companies (British ones) investigating the possible oil field under them. Like it or not, that’s another good reason to keep them.\noddbodd13 said,\nApril 3, 2012 at 12:53 pm\nThe idea that Argentina may have had a hidden agenda in 1982 wasn’t one that’s really occurred to me, so it’s good to have that perspective – thanks.\nJennieB said,\nApril 2, 2012 at 1:23 pm\n“Finders-keepers-losers-weepers”\nRousseau wrote in Discourse of Inequality (I paraphrase as I can’t remember it straight off): “…the earth belongs to no one”.\nThe idea of ‘sovereignty’ and/or land ownership comes from whomever had the biggest ‘guns’/political cunning. They rid the land of its indigenous people (or main predator), appropriated its fauna and flora, gave the land a name – or broke it up with other names. Countries are a man-made concept; a linguistic conceit. As for settlers: communities formed around areas which had rich soil and rivers, then shaped their community by the evolution of cultures, belief, a surge in a concept called ‘patriotism’.\nAlthough I’m not religious, I’m sure there’s something similar that pre-dates Rousseau in the Bible: about humans belonging to the earth and not the other way around. Funny how politicians who subscribe to religion conveniently forget this.\nThe cynic in me reckons that a ‘war’ – or willy-wangling of weapons – would just be to improve certain politician’s approval levels, and to resurrect pointless jingoistic sentiments.",

My apprenticeship began with the Daily Mirror tea-break quickies in 1996, but within a few years I’d graduated to the Daily Express. By 2004 I was a doer (or attempter) of the Times crossword, never managing to finish it in the time it takes to soft-boil and egg. 18 minutes and 24 seconds is my record for that. In 2009 I moved to The Guardian where I’ve been since.\nI have become part of the online cruciverbalist community, regularly entering the Crossword Centre Clue-Writing Competition, which I’ve won once, and in whose annual competition I have been placed as high as fifth.\nI’m also an occasional contributor to Fifteen Squared, a website providing solutions and explanations to a number of publications’ puzzles. I’ve attended one of their Sloggers and Betters events to date, where I’ve met a number of the celebrities of the genre – who in all likelihood, no-one else has heard of.\nHave your say!"
