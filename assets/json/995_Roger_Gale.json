Just write to me at the address above (if the House is not sitting - at weekends and during recess periods - then my mail is forwarded to Kent within hours).\nAlternatively, you may wish to come along and see me at one of my regular constituency Advice Surgeries. In that event please contact me via the link at the top of this page.\nMy wife, Suzy, who is my Parliamentary Office Director and my staff will be delighted to give you full details of my surgeries and to arrange an appointment for us to meet in either Herne Bay or in the Margate area.\nYours sincerely,\nWith all good wishes from Suzy and myself.\n(Promoted by Roger Gale MP of The Old Forge, 215A Canterbury Road, Birchington CT7 9AH)\nLatest Updates & News"
