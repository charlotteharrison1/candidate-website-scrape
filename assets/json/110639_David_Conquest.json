Too much causes floods and too little droughts. Key to our supply of water are the water companies, yet these companies have continually failed us both in terms of developing the infrastructure that we have been paying for and continually dumping sewage into our rivers. Meanwhile the government sits idly by instead of looking after the interests of its citizens.\nThere are two water companies operating in our area. Southern Water and Thames Water. Despite repeated failures to meet their targets, their executives have been well rewarded. The total remuneration package since 2020 for top Thames Water executives has been £8,553,000 whilst the figures for Southern are £4,618,400. This year while Southern Water finally cut bonuses as it was caught criminally dumping on an industrial scale waste, Thames Water splurged £2,450,000 on the top three executives. This is despite failing to meet targets let alone legal requirements.\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for a ban on all CEO bonuses as well as the companies to be reformed as “public service companies”. The reforms would put an end to profit before the environment and ensure their boards include environmental experts. Until then, our local rivers are being pumped full of raw sewage, whilst the water executives hand themselves pay-outs reaching eye-watering levels, with Conservative Ministers refusing to act.\nI was shocked that there was literally no mention of sewage in the King’s Speech. When dealing with a monopoly, we cannot afford to put profit before the environment. The water companies are clearly not working or listening to local concerns on sewage discharges. Furthermore, they have been charging us for improvements to the water infrastructure which they have not carried out.\nThis country’s water industry has become a gravy train where sewage and money flows freely. This is a scandal happening on this government’s watch. Bonuses should be a reward for success, not committing environmental crimes.\nCllr. Luigi Gregori",

Whether your someone who relies of the bus service, a parent wanting a child to get safely to school, someone wanting to use the council tip or a driver fed up with potholes and congestion, these cuts are bad news.\"\nAmongst the proposals put forward by the Conservatives are:\n- • To stop funding all subsidised bus services - (which cover 13% of all Hampshire bus services at present)\n- • To stop funding all community transport e.g. dial-a-ride, call and go and community bus schemes\n- • To stop funding School Crossing Patrols (hoping to get schools and parish councils to pay for them)\n- • To close half of all the Household waste and recycling centres in Hampshire (e.g. Wade Road)\n- • To axe another £500,000 from Winter Road Maintenance, including a reduction in Priority One salting routes\n- • A further dimming of street lights and switching off the street lights in some areas in the middle of the night (e.g.1.00am to 4.00am)\nThe Lib Dem Group Leader commented: \"The Conservatives didn't mention the scale of the cuts either during May council elections or during their so called 'budget consultation'. Years of Conservative mismanagement have taken a toll and the end results is cuts that will be deeply damaging to Hampshire residents. Once you start closing Waste Tips and axing bus services it is very hard to get them back again.\n\"It is mind boggling to hear Conservatives admit that the highways maintenance service 'is now operating at a level below which it would be at risk of not meeting statutory obligations' and yet they propose no action to improve things.\"",

So she says it's the fault of the public for not being \"educated\" enough.\nActually, the oppose is the problem. The public is fed up of being lectured but not listened to.\nInstead of trying to \"educate people\" the Council needs to identify the barriers that prevent people from recycling more and act to remove them.\nIt is nice to hear the Conservatives say they will listen to ideas, but where is the evidence they act on what they hear? It's not exactly difficult to find Councils with better recycling rates which Basingstoke and Deane could learn from; There are literally hundreds of them. The problem has been a lack of political will and an administration putting spin above substance\nSo here's a few ideas to consider: Free Kitchen and/or Garden Waste Collection available to all residents. This option could double recycling rates. Weekly collection of both recycling and black bin waste. More \"every day items in your green bin\" Other Councils collect a vast range of things from the doorstep - all in one wheelie bin. Straight forward, easy to use recycling systems have better results. Better \"Bring Sites\", accepting a wider range of material. There is a good bring site at Wade Road which accepts a wide range of material, but it's hardly convenient for everyone.\nAll of these options require long term commitment and planning from the Council.

It is important to note that these demands are driven by the collapse of any real attempt to deal with inflation. In other words, increasing prices are driving wage demands and not the other way around. These increases in prices are caused by a variety of factors quite a few were under the government's control and not all the fault of foreigners and what they get up to. Brexit has not helped: it has made trade more difficult and expensive and has choked off a ready supply of workers for our economy.\nHow do we move forward?

This plan proposes to set up a minerals and waste processing depot at Basingstoke's railway sidings, just north of Churchill Way West. Road access is likely to be via north east of the site through the industrial estate railway, possibly onto Kingsclere Road.\n\"This proposal will have a major impact on the area,\" says county councillor Ron Hussey. \"The site is just a few metres from Spencer Place and the proposed conversion of the Eli Lilly building into a hotel. Just imagine the noise, dust and vibration from a minerals handling depot and processing plant on local residents. Then there's the impact of heavy lorries up and down Kingsclere Road as well.\"\nBasingstoke Council wrote to the County Council pointing out that the Basingstoke railway sidings lie within close proximity to 300 homes at Spencer Place and that increased noise and disturbance would impact on nearby residents. The Borough Council is also concerned for Victory Hill residents and the nearby conservation areas of Brookvale and South View.\nWhat's surprising is that in February 2010 Hampshire County Council objected to a planning application to develop the Eli Lilly site and stated that developments in the vicinity of the proposed minerals and waste depot might have a negative impact on its planned use of the sidings.\n\"However the Borough Council approved the application to develop the Eli Lilly site and yet HCC have ignored this and decided to carry on regardless. But it's not too late to have your say about this invasive proposal,\" said councillor Hussey.\nYou can read the Minerals and Waste report on the County Council's web site and write to them to let them know your views.

The Autumn Statement revealed that the NHS budget has been cut by £3.5 billion (2.1%) in real terms this year and is set to fall by another £1.3 billion (0.8%) next year. The Conservative government needs to reverse the NHS spending cuts and invest in fixing local hospitals, hiring more staff and ensuring patients get the treatment they deserve.\nFar too many people in are being left waiting endlessly in pain for treatment. Many are being forced to go private. People deserve a local health service that delivers the care they deserve when they need it. Meanwhile the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board (ICB) is consulting on proposed changes to acute hospital services in our area. Their favoured Option is to provide a new specialist acute hospital near Junction 7 of the M3 and changes to the services currently provided by Winchester Hospital. The proposed new hospital is part of the new hospital pledge by Boris Johnson and now Rishi Sunak: the problem is that it is not funded. This will also result in downgrading Winchester’s A&E to a Minor Injuries Unit and reducing its maternity services. I would question that this will lead to an improvement in services.\nProper funding is key to all this. We need to reverse the NHS spending cuts that are leaving our local health services overstretched.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC NWHants",

The analysis suggests that every school in Basingstoke will see budget cuts.\n\"While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions are being spent on divisive Conservative plans to expand grammars and free schools. The Lib Dems' extra £7 billion would ensure no school and no child loses out.\n\"If you want to give our children the best possible start in life, vote Lib Dem on 8 June and help change Britain's future.\"",

For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party.\nThe Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process.\nAccordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community.\nYou do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to.\nFor example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract.\nSimilarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise.

We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.

It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”).\nWe may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.\nWith your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you.\nPlease note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public.\nIn particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority.

Tesco plans for new store\nLocal Liberal Democrats have delivered a survey to thousands of homes in Brighton Hill, Cranbourne, Kings Furlong and part of South Ham, to get residents' views about Tesco's ambitions to open a new superstore on the former Smiths Industries site.\nThe high response shows residents' depth of feelings and concerns. Tesco received about 200 comments at their recent exhibitions at Aldworth Science College and Queen Mary College. To-date the Lib Dems have received over 900 completed survey forms and they are still arriving in the post every day - we expect over 1000 soon. We've analysed the responses that reveal over 700 residents (74%) don't want a Tesco superstore at this site. More surprisingly 4 out of 10 existing Tesco Chineham customers don't want it either.\nTesco claim that they want us to have more choice. But we can already shop at Tesco in Chineham, or Tesco Express in Carpenters Down, Kempshott, Oakridge, Lychpit or Hampstead House in the town centre. But that's not enough. They want to give us even more choice with a new Tesco superstore on the Smiths Industries site.\nAs Tesco spreads its tentacles even wider, what will happen to our local shops? The Lib Dem residents' survey showed that 60% of responses were concerned about losing them.\nMany Kings Furlong residents shop at their local Jaybee's shop. They are worried that it will lose too much trade and be forced to close. Some older people want to know \"who will deliver our newspapers if the shop closes? Tesco don't deliver newspapers\". And if it closes, will that reduce trade at the Centre and pressure the pharmacy?\nCranbourne residents are worried that Tesco competition will end up closing the Anstey Close Londis shop. South Ham and The Berg residents, are concerned about their local shops at Buckland Avenue and Kings Road, and in particular, one of the few remaining independent butchers in Basingstoke.\nSome people however would welcome Tesco provided that it sorts out the traffic problems. About 1 in 5 Sainsburys and ASDA customers would support a Tesco store. This support increases to 1 in 4 for Morrisons' customers.\nBut the most loyal customers are those who do some of their shopping at their local shop. Many of these people rely on the personal service that only a local shop can give. Only 1 in 10 local shop customers support the idea of Tesco on the Smiths Industries site.\n\"It's not about Tesco offering a wider choice, it's about increasing Tesco market share and Tesco profits\", says Lib Dem councillor Kevin Harkess. \"If Tesco comes to the west of the town centre, there is a risk that we could end up with less choice: no Jaybee's at Kings Furlong Centre, no Londis at Anstey Close, no McColl's at Buckland Parade and no butcher or Co-op at Kings Road. And of course these people could lose their jobs alongside losses at other supermarkets\".\nKevin Harkess\nLib Dem councillor\nBrighton Hill",

They are also hoping to persuade other parties to back proposals for all new homes to have parking bays, with electric charging points fitted as diesel and petrol cars are phased out. Of course, none of these travel methods are as green as cycling, and the Lib Dems will continue to press for cycle friendly routes in new developments and major road schemes.\nGreener energy\nThe Lib Dems are well known supporters of renewable energy, but with so much heat and energy lost due to poor building design, they want make sure we cut fuel usage. Proposals to insist all new build homes are zero carbon are part of the party's policy. It's not just energy waste Lib Dems hope to cut. They want a new approach to waste in the borough, encouraging the re-use of goods. This is greener than re-processing the material.\nGreener investment\nBasingstoke and Deane has sufficient money stored up to be bolder and braver with its investments. So far the Council has thrown limited money into green energy despite healthy returns for the initial trial sites. The Lib Dems want to invest more, not only to provide Basingstoke with green energy, but also make sure any profits can be used locally to fund our services.\nMore than just preserving nature\nFarming practices have removed hedgerows, depleting the natural habitat for many species.

The flip side of this coin is the state has a monopoly of force. To achieve these objectives the state must have adequate armed forces, police and security services.\nWe are not meeting the UK threshold for adequate armed forces. We have seen the embarrassment over 2 aircraft carriers who are either too broken or not ready to take part in NATO exercises. Looking at the army, I know that we will be down to less than 150 Challenger 3 tanks, yet in my time in 22 Armoured Brigade back in the early 1990s, we alone had 114 battle tanks. Meanwhile there are similar stories to tell with less aircraft and limited spares which cut down flying hours.\nHow did we get to this stage? The government will boast that Britain punches above its weight, but this requires a military which can sustain military operations. Too often we have spent on sexy and glitzy elements such as nuclear, aircraft carriers and state-of-the-art aircraft. What has not been done is to provide the necessary spare parts and ammunition. Tanks and guns are useless if the ammunition runs out after a couple of days.\nWe also have a real problem in procuring equipment. Partially this is due to a lack of consistent funding which results in a stop-start cycle of procurement. The MoD is not an intelligent customer, and we have not invested in an industrial base which can sustain operations. Allied to equipment problems, recruitment for the services is disastrous. Much of the responsibility lies in outsourcing it rather than using uniformed personnel. Waiting for years before being inducted into the training regime is very wasteful especially when unemployment is high, and recruits can be attracted elsewhere.\nAre quick fixes available? The bad news is no, but the first step is to be honest in what we can afford. We also need to bin the idea that technology can overcome the lack of any critical mass in combat power such as tanks, artillery and aircraft.

As a campaigner, one of my biggest worries is health provision. The lack of dentists is an even bigger issue than the lack of doctors. Forgive the numbers but they paint a stark picture. Research by the House of Commons Library estimates that in England the number of children who have not been seen by an NHS dentist in the year to June 2023 is 4,426,877 (38.71%). The figure for adults not seen over the last 24 months is 22,959,977 (52.1%).\nThis is despite the NHS recommending that under-18s see a dentist at least once a year because their teeth can decay faster. Furthermore, we forget that tooth decay is the leading cause of hospital admissions for children aged 6-10. Every parent knows how important it is to ensure that their children can see a dentist when they need to. Leaving children in pain will disrupt their eating, sleeping and learning.\nWhat is the position locally? In Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, the figures are significantly worse. For children over 12 months the figures are 170,297 (48.7%). 871,947 adults (62.1%) were not seen over 24 months. These figures hide the human result: those who have the money end up paying hundreds of pounds for private care, those who cannot afford it end up suffering.\nWe need an emergency rescue plan for NHS dentistry, including spending any funding that has gone unspent in recent years to boost the number of appointments. A simple first step would be the removal of VAT on children’s toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nCllr Luigi Gregori",

(see Gazette, Monday 8th March). At a time when the population served by the Hospital continues to increase, this is a double blow. Whilst the hospital NHS trust will do its best to manage the process, much of the real change needed is beyond their powers.\nThe Government is currently committed to making billions of \"efficiency savings\" in the NHS and further cuts are likely as the UK deals with a debt mountain. Labour ministers are happy to take the credit for success in the NHS but are nowhere to be seen when care is compromised.\nLocal people have been let down by Labour. Last week Labour councillors in Basingstoke were delivering a leaflet which states \"Labour invests in Basingstoke NHS\".\nWhat a joke. Contrast the amount of fuss they have made about who is to be Mayor with their lack of anything useful to say about the funding crisis problems at our local hospital.\nResidents will be worried. A national survey in the current issue of the Nursing Times reveals horror stories of patients being treated in areas of the hospital not designed for clinical care. Beds are being put in the middle of wards, patients are being put on trolleys in corridors, cupboards and kitchens as hospitals struggle to cope. There has been the scandal at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust were up to 1,200 people died needlessly. Residents will want to know if these are warnings that will be heeded or the shape of things to come.\nWe can reform the NHS to redirect many to health care. The Liberal Democrats believe that the NHS needs to be put under local control\nAnyone working in the NHS knows that the government sets so many tests and ask so many unnecessary questions that each hospital now employs an army of clerks simply to respond. What we need is common sense regulations that don't waste health professional's time. This would drastically reduce costs across the NHS and free staff to concentrate on patient care.\nReducing central control would mean fewer civil servants are needed. By reducing the size of the central bureaucracy could lead to enormous efficiency savings. Lib Dems would halve the cost of civil servants in the dept of health over four years.\nThere are too many unelected quangos - these need to be cut back or scrapped. There are 14 different bodies \"scrutinising\" the local NHS. Only a tiny fraction of the health budget is spent on preventing people getting ill in the first place. Lib Dems would increase that spend. Prevention is better than cure.\nWe can spend money more wisely and improve patient care.",

(710 pa for the Basingstoke area 30 for the West of the Borough)\nThis was a recorded vote and the details are available in the Minutes of the Council Meeting 13/10/2005 on the Council website.\nhttp://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/council/councillors/councilmeetings?meetingid=454\nThe 740 figure was subsequently increased by both the Conservative controlled County Council and the Conservative controlled regional body before the Government set an even higher figure.\nThe Liberal Democrats have been clear that they do not support the imposition of housing targets on local Councils.\nLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg says \"Let's build our national housing target from local targets that reflect need on the ground. Bottom up. That means trusting people who know best rather than picking numbers out of the air\nLib Dem Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Julia Goldsworthy has said:\n\"The Government's centralist proposals override the needs of local people, but the Conservative approach is no better. Under their plans, council decisions on housing development would be driven by the prospect of cash bonuses. Both approaches spell disaster for communities, and would put local needs at the bottom of the priority list.\"\nIt is worth keeping in mind that the last time there was last a Conservative controlled Council and Government, from 1979-1995 the average number of new dwellings each year in Basingstoke and Deane was over 1000. In fact the average figure from 1961-2005 was 990 new dwellings per year. There was a slow down from 1995 -2005, but since the Conservative regained control of the Council, the number of new units has shot up to the 1,000 level.\nThe Liberal Democrats have been very clear that they do not support substantial development in the vicinity of Basing Ward on very strong environmental grounds.\nWhen in joint-administration and drawing up the current Local Plan, we ruled it out.\nThe reality is that development to the East of Basingstoke it is only back on the Agenda because the Conservatives have been irresponsible on the issue of Manydown.\nIt is regrettable that the Conservatives have put short-term party political advantage over the long-term interests of the Borough.\nNationally, whilst campaigning against Labour's house building targets, the Conservatives have also lambasted Labour's failure to build enough houses and have pledged that the Conservatives will build more !\nFor example, in March 2006 David Cameron called for more house-building to provide an \"adequate\" number of homes in the UK, mocking opponents of new developments as \"bananas\" - people who want to 'Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone'.\nThe Conservatives recently launched their policy paper \"Open Source Planning\". This is being sold to residents as putting them in control, but to developers as something else. The Conservative national party website quotes Peter Redfern - Chief Executive, Taylor Wimpey in support of 'Open Source Planning'\n\"This is a truly radical approach to the planning system but it is a workable approach and one which will be a definite improvement on the current system.\"\nPlease be aware of Taylor Wimpey interest in \"Basingstoke East\"\nhttp://www.loddonvillage.com/default.asp?PageID=1\nAt the Council, the Lib Dems group leader Cllr John Shaw has asked for the Conservatives to rule out development East of Basingstoke but have been rebuffed.\nThe Basingstoke Lib Dems believe that the current situation is highly dangerous.

It's crazy. How can this help our economy? The overall pot of money is too small. It's not sufficient to meet rising costs.\nThese will be the largest real terms funding cuts to schools for a generation. The Minister for Education needs to go back to the Chancellor and get more money. In addition, the Government needs to look again at the funding formula. We can't afford these cuts. We need the Chancellor to do another U-turn.\"\nJanice Spalding the former Parliamentary Candidate for Basingstoke on discussion of these figures said \"My main driver for standing in 2015 was to to see investment in schools and teaching so that we have the right skills for industry as Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics have all suffered from underfunding and there is a significant skills shortage.

As the Council begins examining this important issue, Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, sets out his take on solutions to the housing crisis - which include local authorities taking a greater role in the large scale building of social housing.\nSir Vince says: \"The housing crisis is essentially about affordability: prices that rule out owner-occupation for most young families in many parts of the country; rents that are bringing much stress to low and middle income tenants.\n\"Of course, we need many more houses built. But this is a longterm solution: even if 300,000 houses a year were built - way above present levels - it would bring down prices by an estimated 5%. Not surprising as the additional houses represent only 1% of homes. We need specific action to make new housing affordable.\n\"The first is a large-scale building of social housing for rent commissioned by councils or housing associations. We believe 100,000 a year is feasible.\n\"The second is a major programme of building of homes for purchase, or part purchase or rent-to-buy. To be affordable to first time buyers and key workers they would need to be much cheaper than the average price of new homes, now. That means cutting the link between escalating land and house prices.\n\"There are various ways of doing this: using public land without the current legal requirement to maximise value; the introduction of land value taxation which would incentivise the best use of land; and modifications to land compensation legislation so that compulsory purchase can be used without the payment of 'hope value' for change of use.\"",

I believe that a hard Brexit will be disastrous for us, damaging our economy, starving essential services of funding and making us all worse off.\nSince the EU referendum last June, the pound has fallen, prices have risen, economic growth has been erratic, and wages are no longer growing as much as they were. When prices go up and wages do not, millions of people are going to be poorer.\nThe average household is likely to be £500 worse off in 2017 compared to 2016 - and that's before the Brexit negotiations have even started in earnest.\nAnd it gets worse. Over a five-year period, Brexit will have dented the public finances by £59 billion. That's money that could have been used to cut waiting times in A&E, provide care for the elderly and invest in educating the next generation.\nBusinesses are suffering too, through higher import prices, a shortage of EU workers, and reduced investment. Make no mistake: our economic future is hanging in the balance.\nThe Liberal Democrats are the only party that has consistently championed Britain's membership of the European Union. Labour's failure to hold the government to account has given the Conservatives a clear run at their extreme version of Brexit.\nIn last year's referendum, the British people voted for departure but not for a destination - which is why I believe they deserve a say on the final deal that's negotiated with Europe.\nThat's why the Lib Dems will fight to secure terms with the EU that retain as many of the benefits of EU membership as possible. That's why we'll call a referendum on the final Brexit agreement, so that the people can decide the future for the country. That referendum will offer two choices: accept the deal, or remain in the EU.\nOur town and our country needs an effective opposition to hard Brexit, and I urge you to change Britain's future by voting for a real opposition - the Liberal Democrats.",

For those who may struggle to engage with appointment-only services, a chance pop-in can save lives. Our community pharmacies are a vital part of our local health services and our high streets.\nThe potential of community pharmacies to improve patient health and reduce the pressure on NHS hospitals and GPs is immense. With GP appointments scarce and other health services stretched beyond breaking point, it is more important than ever that the Government supports community pharmacies. The most recent local data available shows that, every month, pharmacies across North West Hampshire process around 124,000 prescriptions. In addition to this, in October last year, our community pharmacies carried out 1,678 flu vaccinations as well as a variety of other services.\nBut this local frontline health service has reached a point of critical pressure which puts patient support at risk of serious deterioration. We have all noticed the increase in waiting times to collect our prescriptions or see a pharmacist, yet the government wants to use them to further alleviate pressure on GP services. We have lost one out of 16 pharmacies since 2016, despite a significant ongoing increase in Andover’s population. Nationally, there have been a total of 666 pharmacy closures across England.\nFewer pharmacies mean poorer local services, and greater pressure on our NHS. If we are to make best use of pharmacies as part of a coherent NHS, we need to put them on a sustainable financial footing, building on the Pharmacy First approach in Scotland, and we also need to ensure that sufficient pharmacists are being trained.\nLuigi Gregori.

The road is unlit, narrow and has no pavement, just nettles.\nThe children's centres in Lychpit and Chineham among others are a valuable resource which we cannot afford to lose.

Engineers say there are too many access roads and this limits capacity and traffic flow. This proposal would close access for traffic exiting Western Way and divert it with a new road through the Camrose football ground onto Winchester Road. The roundabout would also be made smaller to add an extra traffic lane on the roundabout. The traffic signals would include crossings for pedestrians and cyclists and the subways would also be retained.\nOption 2 - to adopt the Tesco proposal for a 'through-about' (similar to Black Dam roundabout) with signalised junctions.\nOption 3 - the Tesco proposal and in addition, closed access from Western Way.\nOption 4 - a flyover. This option requires much more land, would have much higher costs and be more disruptive to implement.\nEngineers have looked at traffic growth up to 2031 and the impact across the whole road network for each option. Option 1 produced the best traffic flow with the biggest increase in capacity and the best reductions in congestion.\nResidents will be consulted on the four options in September, and we expect a decision to be made in November.

The answer is that they voted against the incompetent bumbling of the last Conservative government...\nOne hundred days in, many of us are probably wondering why they voted Labour. The answer is that they voted against the incompetent bumbling of the last Conservative government, or in many cases stayed at home. Yet what Keir Starmer and his merry band do has a major impact on all our daily lives.\nThere have been some major blunders ranging from the handling of the Winter Fuel Payments for pensioners to criticising P&O using intemperate language leading to the potential cancellation of a £1 billion investment. My biggest worry is that the chancellor, a former treasury official, will behave more like a former treasury official than a chancellor. The models used by the treasury stifle investment and lead to cost overruns. The Prime Minister, his popularity hitting new lows, has made some howlers. Taking thousands of pounds and freebies for clothes and specs is a donation too far. True, it is not the millions of pounds received by Tories from property developers where local planning authority decisions were overturned.\nLooking forward I suspect that we will see more centralised control of our country. We will move from a belief that the market knows best to one where the state or rather Labour knows best. Both approaches gouge us. The latest indicator of this is a mandated requirement for Test Valley to increase its housing allocation by 75% leading us to build 1000 new houses every year without considering the practicalities including infrastructure and construction capacity. A similar situation applies to Basingstoke and Deane.\nWhat does this all mean? The old adage of judging people by what they do rather than what they say comes to mind. Past performance is a good indicator of future behaviour, and we really need to challenge more.\nCllr. Luigi Gregori\nCulture and Arts\nA big thank you goes to Test Valley Borough Council and its officers for putting on the excellent Taste of Test Valley event last Sunday... I do hope its success will encourage Test Valley to produce more cultural delights.\nA big thank you goes to Test Valley Borough Council and its officers for putting on the excellent Taste of Test Valley event last Sunday. Although the first of its kind, it had a good selection of food stalls and band. I particularly enjoyed the layout with chairs around the stage which provided an atmospheric setting. I do hope its success will encourage Test Valley to produce more cultural delights.\nAs new developments change the face of Andover, we are in danger of losing our cultural and arts heritage. Not because it is not there but because too often it is lost amidst all the other things that are going on. I will give two examples: Andover museum and the library. The museum, often subject to speculation about its potential closure, is a little jewel, but it is run by a trust funded predominately by the nearly bankrupt Hampshire County Council. Currently, it has an exhibition on the Roman town of Silchester which is well worth a visit. The museum, only open from Fridays to Sundays, is tucked away in the old grammar school. The county funded library is within the Chantry Centre. When I was a child you could visit a library outside working hours but that has gone, though to be fair it is open on Saturdays. Museums and libraries are important public spaces but like all public space need investment.\nThe problem with culture and arts is that they rarely make money and often have to be subsidised by councils. However, there is a strong link to footfall and the local economy. Culture and arts attract visitors and they bring money. Such synergies do not come about through chance. If we are to spend money on culture it would be useful if the council had a strategy. This is particularly important with the town centre redevelopment and the new theatre facilities.\nCllr. Luigi Gregori\nHospices\nTwo things are certain in life: taxes and death... about 30,000 people need specialist end of life care ... and they will receive it in a Hospice.\nTwo things are certain in life: taxes and death. Close to 600,000 people die in the UK annually post pandemic. About half pass away at home or in a care home with most of the rest in hospital. Yet about 30,000 people need specialist end of life care (nearly 5% of all deaths) and they will receive it in a Hospice. A much larger number receive palliative care from Hospices deploying staff into the community with more than 80% of the Hospices’ work accounted this way. This work is delivered in partnership with the NHS. Importantly hospices also support the relatives of the dying and dead including children, but they are now hit being hit by a major funding crisis. This funding shortage is leading to staff cuts and reductions in services.\nGovernments, both Labour and Conservative, have ignored that Hospices rely on a combination of NHS contracts and donations. Medical inflation is greater than normal inflation, and the rising costs and demands have not overall been met by increasing levels of funding from whatever source. Palliative care is not a sexy subject, but all of us may require it in some way for ourselves or loved ones. However, having experienced end of life care abroad and in this country, both through family and friends, my strong belief is that we do not understand what a great service we have here.\nA true NHS should provide care from cradle to the grave. With annual deaths predicted to rise by about 130,000 by 2040 the need for end of life care will grow. Expecting that this will all be funded through donations is impractical. We need to cough up more in tax money to support these vital services provided by a Hospice - but please carry on donating. Every little bit helps.\nCllr. Luigi Gregori\nChildcare Failing.\nThe cost of living crisis has put significant additional stress on families, particularly if they have children. It effectively forces both partners to work if possible. Key to this is the ability to gain access to childcare.\nThe cost of living crisis has put significant additional stress on families particularly if they have children. It effectively forces both partners to work if possible. Key to this is the ability to gain access to childcare. Yet the number of childcare places in Hampshire alone has fallen by over 1000 since 2019 according to the House of Commons Library research.\nThis comes as applications opened last week (13th May) for parents to register for 15 hours of free childcare from September for children from 9 months old. You would expect that the Conservative government would ensure that there would be additional capacity for childcare provision to meet this demand. Clearly this is not the case, and the fall in providers is putting the deliverability of the government’s plans into doubt. The Government needs to review the rates paid to providers for free hours to ensure they cover the actual costs of delivering high-quality childcare.\nIn Hampshire, 1,008 childcare places have been lost since 2019, equating to a 2.5% fall in the number of places. The number of childcare providers has also seen a decline, being 395 fewer than in 2019, a 20% fall. The difference in % falls suggests that childcare providers are getting bigger but there are less of them. Smaller, local providers are being forced out which will lead to less choice for parents. Nationally, the number of childcare providers, including nurseries and childminders, has dropped by a fifth. Every area in the country but one has seen a fall in the number of childcare providers since 2019, leaving parents with less choice. Last month the National Audit Office criticised the Government’s roll out saying that dates for the scheme were decided without understanding whether the sector would be able to provide the number of places needed.\nChildcare has been driven to the brink by years of neglect from this Conservative Government. Free hours are no good if parents cannot find a nursery or childminder for their child. The government urgently needs to review the rates it pays providers to ensure they cover the actual costs of delivering high-quality childcare and early years education.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC NW Hants\nMore Sewage Spills\nThe local press has rightly highlighted the shenanigans of water companies and in particular the dumping of sewage in our rivers. Last year, sewage was dumped into England’s rivers over 460,000 times ...\nThe local press has rightly highlighted the shenanigans of water companies and in particular the dumping of sewage in our rivers. Last year, sewage was dumped into England’s rivers over 460,000 times for a total of over 3.6 million hours. 9 in 10 constituencies in England saw a rise in the duration of sewage dumping and 90% saw a rise in the number of spills in 2023 compared to the previous year.\nAcross North West Hampshire sewage dumping has soared by 166% for a staggering 5672 hours in 2023 based on data from the Environment Agency. This is a shocking 166% rise in the duration of sewage spills compared to the previous year, showing how the sewage scandal has worsened under the Conservative government’s watch. Sewage was dumped into local rivers on 367 separate occasions in 2023. This is a 125% increase in the number of sewage spills, up from 163 in 2022.\nIt is disgusting that there has been such a sharp rise in water companies pumping their filthy sewage into our waterways. People are sick to the back teeth with Conservative MPs voting time and again to allow water companies to get away with this environmental vandalism. The whole thing stinks.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC North West Hants\nThe Liberal Democrats have led the way in campaigning against sewage dumping. The party is calling for strict measures including replacing Ofwat with a tougher regulator, a ban on bonuses for water company bosses whose firms have dumped sewage and the declaration of a national environmental emergency. Come any election, the Conservative Party faces a reckoning at the ballot box from people fed up with this sewage scandal.\nLocal Government Funding\nWe will all have noticed the decline in council services ranging from potholes to school funding. These cuts affect us all. Hampshire County Council is consulting on what services they should cut further...\nWe will all have noticed the decline in council services ranging from potholes to school funding. These cuts affect us all. Hampshire County Council is consulting on what services they should cut further as the Local Government Association estimates that councils in England have a funding gap of over £4 billion over the next two years. One in five English local authorities are in danger of bankruptcy this year or next, with half not confident that they have the money to fulfil their legal duties next year. Concern about funding is cross-party with both Tory Hampshire and Labour Southampton unable to meet their needs under current arrangements.\nWhy have we got to this place? Basically, cuts in the central government grant whilst expecting councils to do much more. The National Audit Office estimates that between 2010/2011 and 2021/2022 the real spending power of English councils was reduced by 29%. An ageing population requires increasing complexity and cost of care - the Health Foundation suggests that £14 billion may be needed by 2030/31 to fund Adult Social Care alone. Meanwhile, the number of looked after children is over 80,000 and rising. The Conservative government's approach for councils to use reserves and capital receipts to subsidise their revenue expenditure is fundamentally wrong and unsustainable. Most councils have reached the limits of what can be achieved by efficiency savings.\nHow do we move forward? As the pandemic demonstrated, local government is key to delivering cheaper and more effective solutions to the biggest issues for the public. The next Government must put in place a proper long term funding of local government and, as a matter of urgency, close the £4 billion funding gap. We must also address the elephant in the room and build a consensus on long-term funding of social care.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC NW Hants\nBudget Pensioner Stealth Tax.\nResearch by the Resolution Foundation think tank has found pensioners are set to lose out from last week’s Budget. This is due to the Conservative government’s decision to freeze income tax thresholds, which will lead to a £8 billion tax bombshell...\nResearch by the Resolution Foundation think tank has found pensioners are set to lose out from last week’s Budget. This is due to the Conservative government’s decision to freeze income tax thresholds, which will lead to a £8 billion tax bombshell for pensioners across the country by 2027-28, or an average of £1,000 each. The much vaunted cuts by the Chancellor on the rate of National Insurance do not affect pensions as they are not subject to National Insurance.\nThis demonstrates that the Conservative Party has ‘abandoned’ the nearly 15,000 pensioners in North West Hampshire who are already struggling to pay their bills. The Liberal Democrats introduced the pension triple lock and were the first party to commit in full to the triple lock for the upcoming general election, which ensures pensions will see an increase by whichever is highest of average earnings growth, CPI inflation, or 2.5%. We have also called on the government to double the Winter Fuel Allowance to offer extra help to pensioners, paid for by a proper windfall tax on the oil and gas companies.\nI do not think it is fair that pensioners who have worked hard and paid taxes all their lives are now being punished by this Conservative government with a £1,000 stealth tax. Many elderly people are already struggling to make ends meet as heating bills and the cost of the weekly shop go through the roof. Now these Conservative tax hikes will only pile on the misery. As Liberal Democrats we are proud of our record of introducing the triple lock to protect people’s pensions. We will continue to stand up for the pensioners in our community who have been cruelly abandoned by the Conservatives, including by calling on the Government to double the Winter Fuel Allowance.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC NW Hants\nDelays to GP Appointments.\nI do not know how many of us struggle to get a GP appointment within a reasonable time, but the stories told are not impressive. Recent figures show our community has been abandoned by this government when it comes to local health services\nI do not know how many of us struggle to get a GP appointment within a reasonable time, but the stories told are not impressive. Recent figures show our community has been abandoned by this government when it comes to local health services. Over 500,000 people in Hampshire waited for more than 4 weeks for a GP appointment last year. This was a 40% rise on those waiting more than 4 weeks since 2022. NHS data collated by the House of Commons Library found that the number of appointments that saw patients wait two weeks or longer in Hampshire has spiked by 19% to 1,845,132 in 2023, up from 1,545.000 the previous year.\nThe Liberal Democrats have criticised the Conservative government for letting the community down with their neglect of local health services. We are calling for a legal right to get a GP appointment within seven days, or 24 hours if in urgent need. The policy would enshrine this right in the NHS Constitution, putting a duty on the government and health service to make sure it happens. It would be achieved by increasing the number of GPs, and increasing the number of nurses and pharmacists fully qualified to prescribe day to day medicines.\nWhilst there has been a 7% increase in Hampshire GP appointments requests there is a widening gap between our needs as a community and the ability of government to meet it. This gap is causing people huge anxiety because they cannot be confident any more of getting the care they need.\nBeing able to see a GP when you need to, should not be too much to ask, but even on this measure people are being failed after years of neglect by this Conservative government. That is why we, the Liberal Democrats, are calling for a legal right for all patients to see their GP within seven days or 24-hours if in urgent need.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC NWHants\nDefend the Triple Lock.\nWe are all still suffering from a cost of living crisis, and whilst inflation is falling, it is still high compared to recent decades. The Conservative government is reportedly set to break the triple lock introduced by the Liberal Democrats once more ..\nWe are all still suffering from a cost of living crisis, and whilst inflation is falling, it is still high compared to recent decades. The Conservative government is reportedly set to break the triple lock introduced by the Liberal Democrats once more by not uprating fully in line with earnings. Instead, they will exclude bonuses meaning that pensioners will receive a 7.8% rise in the state pension, not the 8.5% the triple lock should guarantee them.\nHow will this affect pensioners in our local constituency of North West Hampshire? Lib Dem analysis suggests that failing to properly implement the triple lock in 2024 could result in a hit of around £1,296,581 for our pensioners next year alone. This comes after pensioners suffered a major cut in 2022 when the government opted not to uprate the state pension in line with earnings, instead using CPI. The effect of both cuts since 2022 could result in an eye-watering hit of £11,858,901 for North West Hants pensioners alone. That equates to a £550 raid on each pensioner. It comes as the Liberal Democrats have been the only major party to commit to the triple lock in full ahead of the next General Election.\nTo row back on the triple lock would be another in a long list of callous Conservative party broken promises. Pensioners have contributed for decades to our society. This Conservative government should not turn their back on them once again during a cost of living crisis. The triple lock must be maintained. Instead, this out of touch Prime Minister looks set to punish them for his own party crashing the economy.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nNHS Failing Diagnostic Testing Targets.\nSince I last wrote on our local Hampshire hospitals’ inability to meet their targets, I have been approached by a number of people highlighting the misery and concern thrown up by the long delays in treatment.\nSince I last wrote on our local Hampshire hospitals’ inability to meet their targets, I have been approached by a number of people highlighting the misery and concern thrown up by the long delays in treatment. One couple in their 70s who paid their taxes and worked in the public sector all their lives find that a much needed operation is not available within the foreseeable future under the NHS. At this stage of their lives, while some discomfort may be acceptable, the level of pain is unacceptable and so is the poor quality of life. The solution to maintaining a reasonable quality of life in their mature years is to go private. In another case, an elderly male with cancer cannot get the necessary appointments or drugs. I am sure that Mr Sunak has no such issues. But of course, Mr Sunak does not use the NHS.\nOne indication of the current situation within the NHS is the waiting lists for diagnostic tests like MRI or CT scans. We all know that diagnostic tests are a key tool for our doctors. Yet within the NHS there are shortages in both the machines and technicians to use them. Within our Hampshire hospitals NHS trust, the waiting lists rose from 6,142 in June 2019 to 12,563 in July 2023. The NHS target is that less than 1% of people should be waiting more than six weeks for these important tests. In July, 29% of patients in our area waited six weeks or longer. Therefore, not only do we get major delays seeing the doctors and specialists, but then we get further delays before getting treatment as we have to join another queue for diagnostic tests. When Mr Sunak tells us the NHS is in good hands and healthy, we know better.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nCancer Treatment\nOur NHS is just not working for us. We have all seen the recent reports over our local Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (HHFT) which is nearly £28 million in deficit. This makes it one of the worst in the country for its size.\nOur NHS is just not working for us. We have all seen the recent reports over our local Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (HHFT) which is nearly £28 million in deficit. This makes it one of the worst in the country for its size. Meanwhile, the backlog in referrals let alone treatment increases. The situation is in reality worse as many are going private, if they can afford it.\nOne area of particular concern is cancer treatment. The latest NHS figures show that, in the last year, 637 cancer patients in HHFT waited more than 62 days to start treatment after being referred. This means only 65.5% of patients in our area were treated within two months, below the government target of 85%. In short HHFT is missing a key target and causing untold misery. Note that a referral needs a doctor’s appointment first which can be problematic. The shame is that once we enter the treatment pipeline, the actual service provided can be excellent.\nWith the NHS there is no easy fix. We need to move forward on getting a proper work force plan in place and we need to pay people fairly. The hospital estate needs to be upgraded as too much money is being spent on maintenance or vanity projects. We also need to invest in new radiotherapy machines, cut the time for new medicines to reach patients, and better support for cancer patients and their families. This will all cost money, The Liberal Democrats suggest £1 billion a year for England alone. However, spending money on cancer not only reduces human misery, but also makes economic sense.\nCllr Luigi Gregori",

For example, large unrepaired potholes in Sullivan Road have the potential to distract drivers from looking out for pedestrians and cyclists - including children going to and from nearby Chalk Ridge Primary School. The defects are also a hazard to inexperienced motorists taking their tests at the nearby driving test centre.\nAndy Konieczko Liberal Democrat councillor candidate for Brighton Hill North in this May's Borough Council election, said: \"More and more residents are telling us that the condition of our roads is getting worse, but Hampshire County Council isn't listening to their concerns. We have to put that right because residents' safety is being put at risk.\n\"Basingstoke's roads are being left to deteriorate and we're all suffering from the resulting pothole plague. Drivers, cyclists and pedestrians are risking injury, motorists are experiencing damage to their cars, and Council Tax payers are having to fork out more in compensation. Everybody loses out because the Conservatives on Hampshire County Council are trying to cut costs and aren't looking after our roads.\n\"Whenever I talk to residents in Brighton Hill, the issue of potholes inevitably crops up in conversations - and it's not hard to see why.\n\"Large potholes in Bliss Close were marked out by the Council in white paint more than 12 months ago - but the Council hasn't fixed them yet and the markings are now beginning to fade! That's not acceptable.\n\"Major defects on Sullivan Road haven't been touched since they were reported and marked out back in January.\n\"Fixing these particular potholes should be a priority for the Council because drivers are focusing their attention on avoiding the potholes rather than looking out for children at nearby Chalk Ridge Primary School. The potholes also pose a risk to those taking their driving tests in the area. If a driving test isn't daunting enough, imagine the extra stress an inexperienced motorist feels when their car thuds along a pockmarked road surface.\n\"Local residents shouldn't have to put up with this. The Conservatives on Hampshire County Council can't sit back and hope that the problem will go away. It won't. And the longer they leave it, the worse our town's pothole plague will become.

Dogs used in backstreet breeding endure a miserable life, producing countless litters before being turfed out on to the street once they have served their purpose. This needs to end.\"\nBattersea's rescue centres see the result of this cruel practice every day. Marjorie, a two-year old Bulldog, arrived at Battersea as a stray in November 2014. She was bald in places, unable to sit down, withdrawn and showing obvious signs of overbreeding. After a lot of care and dedication from the staff at Battersea, Marjorie began to come out of her shell, showing an affectionate nature and despite her awful start in life she will get a second chance to go to a caring, loving home she so deserves.\nUnfortunately, not all of these dogs will be as lucky as Marjorie. Layla, a four year old Staffordshire Bull Terrier, was another stray that came to the charity last year, also showing signs of overbreeding. Despite all of the support she received from Battersea, this poor dog had already been through so much that nothing more could be done for Layla and sadly she had to be put to sleep.\nClaire Horton, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home Chief Executive, said: \"Battersea is speaking out to help expose and shame the callous breeders in our communities who are creating far too many unhealthy, unwanted, and abandoned dogs all in the name of personal profit. At Battersea we see the consequences of this problem every day.

I suppose that won't hit me until I fly up to Newcastle this Sunday. So why am I sharing this with you? Well it has made me stop and think what am I doing standing in this election? What is my purpose? What do I think I shall achieve? Will I make a difference? I know I don't have the answers to all these questions but I can try - if you don't try you will never know.\nI have reached a certain age when I want to use my work experience to help the next generation to have a good opportunity, training and be able to enjoy life. Why? I am a Software Engineer and I see there is a big problem looming. Let me explain, when I started work for a UK Software company the average age of the company was 25, I was then 23. Today the average age of where I work now is 55, I am 53. If someone leaves the company it now takes an average of 9 months to find a replacement, and that is if you can find a replacement. The company is restricted to employing UK citizens only (for Security reasons).This recruitment process is extremely expensive for the business and having shortfalls in staff does affect the service offered to customers. This would explain UK companies recruiting from abroad.\nSo how can we fix this? We have to invest in training and schools, and not have this endless fixation about testing and league tables. Having qualified teachers in subjects they know about. Teaching life skills is very important not just subjects you can test but music, arts they encourage social skills, confidence which are invaluable in any field of work. For my last company I was a Graduate mentor and experienced what these bright kids had not been taught. This is a problem, I am an engineer, I want to fix it.\nThis is what concerns me, this is what drives me - but who do you believe? If you don't know who to believe or trust - look at the people you can vote for - and ask would you buy a used car from this person? A Member of Parliament is after all just another person.\nPS The Van is not for sale!",

One year on this has not happened and nationally the waiting lists have continued to rise. In local terms they have remained relatively static.\nThe Conservative government slashed funding for the NHS despite waiting lists growing compared to last year. The Autumn Statement revealed that the NHS budget has been cut by £3.5 billion (2.1%) in real terms this year and is set to fall by another £1.3 billion (0.8%) next year. The Conservative government needs to reverse the NHS spending cuts and invest in fixing local hospitals, hiring more staff and ensuring patients get the treatment they deserve.\nFar too many people in are being left waiting endlessly in pain for treatment. Many are being forced to go private. People deserve a local health service that delivers the care they deserve when they need it. Meanwhile the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board (ICB) is consulting on proposed changes to acute hospital services in our area. Their favoured Option is to provide a new specialist acute hospital near Junction 7 of the M3 and changes to the services currently provided by Winchester Hospital. The proposed new hospital is part of the new hospital pledge by Boris Johnson and now Rishi Sunak: the problem is that it is not funded. This will also result in downgrading Winchester’s A&E to a Minor Injuries Unit and reducing its maternity services. I would question that this will lead to an improvement in services.\nProper funding is key to all this.

The European Investigation Order has the potential to cut red tape and catch more criminals.\nAt present a complex set of rules make it confusing, complicated and time-consuming for British police to cooperate with their Continental counterparts to collect the evidence that could put robbers, fraudsters, rapists and terrorists behind bars. The only people who benefit from bureaucratic hobbling of police investigations are the criminal gangs who find hopping across borders as easy as pie. If the UK does not join in this project, we will be at a disadvantage in getting court convictions in the UK of foreigners committing crimes here.\nBut the draft will certainly need considerable improvement to increase the human rights and privacy safeguards for individuals. I am sure that is what the coalition government, which has already in 10 weeks taken a series of excellent civil liberties decisions, will seek to do, as will MEPs.\nYour reference to the European Parliament needing to merely \"sign off\" the directive, as if we were going to rubber-stamp it without examining the content, is wide of the mark. Nothing can become law in the EU now without the agreement of the elected MEPs, and we are no pushover - just ask ministers! We will look carefully at whether grounds for refusal should be enlarged - such as when the alleged facts did not take place in or do not constitute a crime in the UK - and to increase data protection and other rights.\nThe measure will not be allowed to pass into law unless a majority of governments and MEPs are satisfied that it bulldozes only paperwork, not protection of fundamental rights.\nYours sincerely,\n(This letter was sent to The Daily Telegraph on Monday 26 July 2010 but was not published.)",
  "https_www_basingstokelibdems_org_uk/https_www_basingstokelibdems_org_uk_news_article_car-thefts/content_58.html": "Car Thefts\nOne of the issues that frequently came up on the doorstep and in surveys during the recent local elections was policing and anti-social behaviour. Whilst local authorities have a role to play in anti-social behaviour, most residents were disappointed in the response from the police. I have seen at first hand the systematic reluctance to investigate crime. This is not good news as the biggest deterrent to criminals is the chance of conviction rather than long sentences. At a meeting in 2021, many local councillors accepted the need to raise the tax for policing on the basis of all the additional officers and investigations that could be carried out. These pledges by the now departed Hampshire Chief Constable do not appear to have been met.\nTo give just one example. A staggering 79% of car thefts in Hampshire went unsolved last year. Meanwhile, just 3% resulted in a charge or summons. These latest Home Office statistics on crime outcomes showed that a grand total of 2747 car theft cases in Hampshire were closed in 2022 without a suspect even being identified - equivalent to 8 car thefts going unsolved every day. It follows previous research from the Liberal Democrats which showed that police failed to even attend 3 in 4 car thefts last year. Nationally, just one in thirty (3.4%) car thefts resulted in a suspect being charged.\nThe Conservative government is overseeing a “car theft epidemic”, as criminals act with impunity while victims are denied justice. Years of unnecessary Conservative cuts and putting resources in the wrong places has decimated community policing. Since 2015, the Conservatives have also taken over 4,000 Police Community Support Officers off the streets. People just want to know that if their car is stolen or house broken into, the police will turn up and properly investigate it.\nWe can fix this by a return to proper community policing - where officers are visible and trusted, with the time and resources to focus on preventing and solving crimes.

This could lead to a European Court judgement and a fine.\nLondon Liberal Democrat MEP Sarah Ludford, a long time campaigner for cleaner air in the capital, said:\n\"It is shameful that a Labour government and Tory Mayor have jointly failed to deliver action to reduce dangerous airborne particles. No Londoner wants money down the drain on European Court fines, but nothing else seems to push Labour and Tories into action.\"\n\"They should be spurred by the appalling health impact. These nasty particles can cause asthma, heart disease and lung cancer. Recent research revealed that poor air quality in London could be responsible for up to 8,000 premature deaths a year. The lax response of the government and Mayor to this health emergency is a betrayal of Londoners.\"\n\"The Liberal Democrats are the only party campaigning on local, regional, national and European levels to clean up London's air. Besides opposing crazy pollution-increasing airport expansion, we propose a Berlin-style Clean Air Zone in the capital to fully tackle air pollution.\"\nSarah has long campaigned on improving London's bad air quality. Last month she and her London Liberal Democrat colleagues Ed Davey MP and Mike Tuffrey AM sent incoming environment commissioner Janez Potočnik a letter demanding that he make enforcing the EU's strict air quality standards in London the first item on his 'to-do list'. She has also been active in the campaign against the 3rd Heathrow runway and expansion of London City Airport, highlighting how this would only worsen London's air quality problem.\nENDS\nNote to Editors\n1. In May 2009 the United Kingdom applied to the Commission for a time extension regarding its 'PM10' dirty particles clean-up obligations. Due to a lack of adequate plans to reduce the dangerously high levels in the Greater London area in particular, a requirement of gaining such a time extension, in December 2009 the European Commission rejected the UK's request.\n2. The expected 'Reasoned Opinion' is the second stage of the Commission's infringement procedure against a member state. The Commission issued the United Kingdom with a first written warning, or letter of formal notice, on 29 January 2009. If the United Kingdom doesn't provide a satisfactory response to the Reasoned Opinion then the Commission may be forced to refer the United Kingdom to the European Court of Justice, where the UK could be faced with large fines.",

It's a great place and I'm proud to call it home, but I know it could be better.\nLiberal Democrat councillors in Hampshire are delighted that following a question in the House of Lords by Lib Dem Environment spokesperson Baroness Kate Parminter, it has again been confirmed that DIY waste should be disposed of for free. The Conservative Minister Lord Bourne, stated in a written answer on 20th March 2017 that DIY waste is household waste and should therefore be disposed of for free. However Conservative-run Hampshire County Council continues to charge for the disposal of waste from DIY claiming that it is not household waste. Cllr Gavin James, Liberal Democrat group leader on Basingstoke and Deane Council said: \"The reply from Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, a Minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government clearly states that there should not be any charges for DIY waste disposal. We once again call on Hampshire Conservatives to scrap these unlawful charges, and this time we expect them to take notice of us as we clearly have the Minister's support. Surely Hampshire County\nThe 2017 Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance survey has found that nearly 20% of roads are in \"poor\" condition.

The Liberal Democrats are calling for an urgent change of policy.\nThe Liberal Democrats have criticised Conservative MPs for voting against the right of thousands of EU nationals in Basingstoke to stay in the UK, as a majority of MPs gave the final go-ahead to a hard Brexit. There are 5,184 residents from elsewhere in the EU living in Basingstoke. There are 343 staff from other EU countries working for the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, (that covers Basingstoke) including 65 doctors and 92 nurses. MPs overturned amendments backed by the Liberal Democrats to give Parliament a vote on the terms of the deal and to guarantee the right of EU nationals to stay after Brexit.",

The answer is that they voted against the incompetent bumbling of the last Conservative government, or in many cases stayed at home. Yet what Keir Starmer and his merry band do has a major impact on all our daily lives.\nThere have been some major blunders ranging from the handling of the Winter Fuel Payments for pensioners to criticising P&O using intemperate language leading to the potential cancellation of a £1 billion investment. My biggest worry is that the chancellor, a former treasury official, will behave more like a former treasury official than a chancellor. The models used by the treasury stifle investment and lead to cost overruns. The Prime Minister, his popularity hitting new lows, has made some howlers. Taking thousands of pounds and freebies for clothes and specs is a donation too far. True, it is not the millions of pounds received by Tories from property developers where local planning authority decisions were overturned.\nLooking forward I suspect that we will see more centralised control of our country. We will move from a belief that the market knows best to one where the state or rather Labour knows best. Both approaches gouge us. The latest indicator of this is a mandated requirement for Test Valley to increase its housing allocation by 75% leading us to build 1000 new houses every year without considering the practicalities including infrastructure and construction capacity.

You just get the sense that both other parties are more interested in putting out leaflet saying 'the other party didn't back our motion, aren't they awful'. In reality neither of the two motions were worded perfectly but the sentiments of both could be supported.\"\n\"The Labour motion was quite right in opposing the current Conservative-run County Council plans for closure of 10 out of 11 local children centres. The Conservative motion offered a way forward recognising that the services are likely to change in any event. It's important we as a Council work closely with County to make sure we develop the best possible service we can for the people of Basingstoke and Deane.\"\n\"Liberal Democrats want the entire Council to unite in saying the current proposals will have a devastating impact but, that we don't just want to oppose the proposals, we want to change them.\"\n\"Several Liberal Democrat Councillors spoke during the debate about their personal experience about the vital support children centres provide. There is no training manual on how to be a parent and the children centres offer invaluable support to both parents and young children. Often a bit of support for parents can avoid situations getting worse and families ending up in Crisis. The County Council is wrong to think that their current proposals are going to save money as in the long term, families will find themselves in deeper crises, and require a greater level of intervention. We will continue to oppose the County's current proposals, however, we will work to review how children centres operated to see if real savings can be made and to make sure the service is evolving to meet the needs of residence today.\"",

But with more and more people being diagnosed, Cancer Research UK says determined political action is urgently needed to save more lives.\nJanice Spalding said: \"We must not underestimate the devastating impact that cancer will have on families in Basingstoke now and in the future. The good news is cutting-edge research carried out by charities like Cancer Research UK is turning the tables on the disease, but it is clear there is a critical role for politicians to play in helping to detect cancer earlier and bring innovative new treatments to patients faster.\n\"The political drive to beat cancer must match the pace of progress in research. That's why I'm backing the 'Cross Cancer Out' campaign and joining the fight to beat cancer sooner. On a personal note, when you know someone currently going through chemotherapy, you can only hope that they pull through but it is a difficult subject.\"\nSarah Woolnough, Executive Director of Policy and Information at Cancer Research UK said: \"We know the earlier patients can be diagnosed and access the treatments they need, the more lives will be saved.\n\"The next Government's decisions will affect how fast and how far we progress in the next five years, towards our goal of beating the disease. It is a big ambition but we know with the right political support we will get there sooner - so we're asking all local election candidates to make a commitment to 'Cross Cancer Out' and help ensure no-one's life is cut short by the disease.\"",

There are over 21,000 pensioners living in North West Hampshire alone. The Liberal Democrats brought in the triple lock whilst in government, lifting 300,000 pensioners out of poverty. However, one in seven pensioners nationally still live in absolute poverty.\nThe party has committed to the triple lock in its draft manifesto for the next General Election adopted at its Autumn Conference this weekend. The commitment would ensure pensions rise in line with inflation, wages or 2.5% – whichever is highest.\nIt means the Liberal Democrats are the only major party to commit to maintaining the triple lock in future years, with both the Conservatives and Labour refusing to do so. The Lib Dems said the policy would protect pensioners facing sky-high bills from the cost of living crisis, adding that pensioners deserve to have the security of knowing that the triple lock will be there to support them in future years.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Luigi Gregori said:\n“Many pensioners are already worried sick about how to pay the bills, as the cost of heating and eating goes through the roof. The refusal of both the Conservatives and Labour to commit to protecting pensions in future is causing even more anxiety for those struggling to get by.”\n“The Liberal Democrats are proud that we brought in the triple lock, lifting thousands of pensioners out of poverty.

And a strong economy is incompatible with a hard Brexit.\n\"Since the EU referendum last June, the pound has fallen, prices have risen, economic growth has been erratic, and wage increases have started to stall. When prices go up and wages don't, millions of people are going to be poorer. A lot poorer.\n\"The average household is likely to be £500 worse off in 2017 compared to 2016 - and that's before the Brexit negotiations have even started in earnest.\n\"And it gets worse. Over a five-year period, Brexit will have dented the public finances by £59 billion. That's money that could have been used to cut waiting times in A&E, provide care for the elderly and invest in educating the next generation.\n\"Businesses are suffering too, through higher import prices, a shortage of EU workers, and reduced investment. Make no mistake: our economic future is hanging in the balance.\n\"At this election, the Liberal Democrats are the only major national party that is sounding the alarm against hard Brexit. Labour's disastrous failure to do the most basic job of an opposition party - holding the government to account - has given the Conservatives a clear run at their extreme version of Brexit.\n\"That's why we'll fight to secure terms with the EU that retain as many of the benefits of EU membership as possible.\n\"That's why we'll call a referendum on the final Brexit agreement, so that you, the people, can decide the future for the country. That referendum will offer two choices: accept the deal, or remain in the EU.\n\"Britain needs an effective opposition to hard Brexit.

The NHS will not release patients unless there is a proper care plan to look after them. Secondly, social care is best done in the community where people live supported in their own community and family where possible.

There are also provisions for unpaid taxes to be recovered, for liability of sub-contractors and effective inspections by Member State authorities.\nSarah Ludford MEP, Liberal Democrat Justice and Human Rights Spokeswoman, said:\n\"It is imperative to crack down on rogue employers. They commit a triple whammy: encouraging the traffickers who bring in illegal migrants; exploiting vulnerable people with pitifully low wages and atrocious conditions; and cheating legal workers and the tax system by undercutting the legitimate labour market.\n\"The UK government's refusal to sign up to this law, on a skimpy pretext, calls into question their credibility in vowing to tackle illegal immigration.

Repeat offenders could attract criminal sanctions. There are also provisions for unpaid taxes to be recovered, for liability of sub-contractors and effective inspections by Member State authorities.\nSarah Ludford MEP, Liberal Democrat Justice and Human Rights Spokeswoman, said:\n\"It is imperative to crack down on rogue employers. They commit a triple whammy: encouraging the traffickers who bring in illegal migrants; exploiting vulnerable people with pitifully low wages and atrocious conditions; and cheating legal workers and the tax system by undercutting the legitimate labour market.\n\"The UK government's refusal to sign up to this law, on a skimpy pretext, calls into question their credibility in vowing to tackle illegal immigration.

Much of this flooding is on our roads over recent years and feels worse than it has ever been. Why is this? Whilst we are seeing rivers being overwhelmed and flooding, much more common is localised flooding around low spots on roads. Unlike river floods, this localised flooding clears relatively quickly, generally within 12 hours of the rainfall event. But they are a significant hazard to road users, and cause damage to the road structure which then needs repair.\nThis road flooding is most often caused by the drainage systems not being maintained by the responsible party, usually in our case Conservative Hampshire County Council (HCC). Once the waters have cleared one can usually see the intended drain which has clearly not done its job. What maintenance is required? Well drainage needs regular cleaning of silt, debris and vegetation. Roads often drain to gullies. These contain silt traps which collect debris and silt, and these require regular (annual) cleaning. Gullies then drain to pipes and ditches and these would typically flow via interceptors and ponds to the nearest watercourse. This network needs regular monitoring and maintenance.\nI suspect that like potholes funding issues have resulted in a significant reduction in the maintenance of all aspects of the road system. However, in the long term this lack of maintenance by Conservative HCC will cost us all more, whether by damage to our vehicles or the need to repair badly maintained roads\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem PPC NWHants",

A revised hourly number 12 service will go from Kempshott to the town centre, via Brighton Hill and Viables and up Hackwood Road, missing out Black Dam and Eastrop. This will cut journey times by 10 minutes.\nA new hourly service (number 17) will be introduced to serve Black Dam and Eastrop so the elderly can access shops and surgeries.\nThe Liberal Democrats believe an efficient bus service could help improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion, as well as giving freedom to residents to benefit from everything the town has to offer.",

  "https_www_basingstokelibdems_org_uk/https_www_basingstokelibdems_org_uk_news_article_labour-missteps/content_15.html": "Labour Missteps\nThe inability of the Labour government to define what it means by ‘working people’ is staggering. Many of us thought that it was a code for working class whatever in turn that meant. Over the weekend we found that a cabinet minister earning over £150,000 a year was ‘working people’ but not hard working self-employed tradesmen or company owners who brought in significant less such as £20,000 a year. This lack of understanding does not bode well for future government policy.\nOne of the other instances where the government has lost the plot has been over the winter fuel payments. Without having done a proper impact assessment, the Labour government has cut an important grant at the same time energy tariffs were going up by 10%. This particular piece of financial incompetence was driven by a desire to be tough, but it is too easy to do so on a vulnerable part of society which already fails to claim the benefits it is entitled to.\nThe other extreme from hitting pensioners is the impending disaster of increasing housing allocations for local councils. Government targets have been increased by around 80% and in most cases councils cannot meet these numbers. This results in developers being able to put forward applications which have to be waived through irrespective of the lack of infrastructure or suitability. Now we all know that we need more houses homes, but we already have over a million houses which have had planning permission but have not been built. Market absorption is where developers will only build where the local housing market will meet the developers’ price. Developers also want to deliver houses which produce the most profit and not those we require. We therefore have a shortage of smaller one or two-bedroom homes but lots of larger palatial builds which we cannot afford.\nWhere do we go from here? In both cases local councils, who often bear the brunt of London's decisions, have expressed their concerns and exasperation. Labour will be in power for another four years so it is our responsibility to challenge constructively.\nCllr Luigi Gregori\nLib Dem Parliamentary Spokesperson",

  "https_www_basingstokelibdems_org_uk/https_www_basingstokelibdems_org_uk_news_article_q-a-with-john-shaw/content_135.html": "Q&A with John Shaw\nI've been asked scores of questions as I've been out and about in Basingstoke over the past few weeks, and it's been enjoyable and rewarding to debate the big issues facing our town and our country as a whole. A few questions tend come up more frequently than others, so I thought I'd highlight them in a Q&A format. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.\nWhy are you standing for election?\nI've lived in Basingstoke for over two decades. Basingstoke is a great place and I'm proud to call it home, but I know there's an opportunity for improvement.\nAs an active local campaigner - I served as Councillor for Brookvale and Kings Furlong on Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council for 16 years and represented Basingstoke North West on Hampshire County Council - I believe I can help make Basingstoke an even better place to live and work.\nWhat issues are you campaigning on?\nI'm a passionate campaigner on health issues. I work for a national disability charity, and have been a partner governor of an NHS hospital trust and board member of a local involvement network representing the needs of patients.\nWhen I see what's happened to health services in our area, it's clear to me that the current Conservative government doesn't care about the NHS or social care. 10,000 bed days were lost in hospitals in and around Basingstoke last year because patients couldn't be discharged into under-funded, under-staffed social care. We need to put that right.\nThat's why I'm backing Liberal Democrats proposals to invest an extra £6 billion a year in health services paid for by an immediate 1p rise on all rates of income tax.\nWhat about education?\nThe message from my conversations with local people is very clear - schools in Basingstoke face significant budgetary pressures and headteachers are going to forced to make some difficult decisions over staffing numbers. These concerns are borne out by figures provided by the National Union of Teachers, which show that schools in Basingstoke will lose a total of £6.4 million of funding by 2019 under current government policy.\nThe Lib Dems have pledged to invest an extra £7 billion in education over the course of the next parliament, and that will ensure that no school and no child loses out.\nWhat other challenges are facing Basingstoke at the moment?\nHousing affordability is a major issue in the area. House prices in Basingstoke are out of reach for many young families, private rents are too high and there isn't enough social housing to meet demand. After many years of delay, we're finally seeing progress on projects such as Manydown. But that's too little too late for many people struggling to afford a home in our town. I want to see increased provision of new homes in Basingstoke using sustainable building technology so that everyone - including young people, teachers, nurses, carers and the police - can afford to live in the area.\nAs a Liberal Democrat, I assume you're against a hard Brexit?\nOur town and the country as a whole cannot thrive without a strong economy. And a strong economy is incompatible with a hard Brexit. Our trading relationship with the EU creates jobs, increases prosperity and helps pay for public services. I'll fight to secure terms with the EU that retain as many of the benefits of EU membership as possible. I'll also back a referendum on the final Brexit agreement, so that you can decide if it's a good deal for the country.\nCan the Liberal Democrats really stand up to the Conservatives?\nI'm convinced that only the Liberal Democrats can provide effective opposition to the Conservatives. The Labour Party is in a mess, fighting amongst themselves rather than acting as the effective opposition this country so urgently needs. UKIP doesn't know what it stands for any more now that the Conservatives have adopted many of their policies.\nCan the Liberal Democrats win in Basingstoke? Can you really beat Maria Miller MP?\nIt's an exciting time to be a Lib Dem in Basingstoke. We increased our share of the vote in the recent County Council elections and membership of the local party has increased by 50% in the past 12 months. I gave Maria Miller a run for her money when I stood against her in the 2010 General Election and I'm aiming to go one better this time!\nAny final message to local people?\nOn 8 June, we have chance to make our country more open, more tolerant and more successful. Vote Lib Dem and help change Britain's future.",

Parking is one of the biggest concerns we hear from Brighton Hill residents and we've been working hard to improve matters. We've arranged for extra street surveys to be carried out across our area to identify problem spots. We've been liaising with the Council's engineering team on creating new spaces, such as the 29 new bays currently being built in Brahms Road. And we've made sure that existing bays are repainted to help us make better use of the spaces we already have. We'll continue to push for more resources to tackle Brighton Hill's parking problems.\n- Demand better public services. We'll continue to fight for your behalf to make sure that our green spaces are looked after and to support important community facilities, including our theatres, ice rink and football club.\n- Demand action on climate change. We'll continue to set the agenda and make sure that the Council urgently pursues initiatives to tackle global warming. We successfully proposed two motions in the most recent Council meeting: one that calls on the Council to look at how eco housing could be incorporated into new developments in Basingstoke, such as Manydown; the other asks the Council to support the important Climate and Ecological Emergencies Bill, which is currently making it's way through Parliament. We'll also push for measures that to promote more walking and cycling in Basingstoke.\nYou can read our full manifesto here.\nOver the last few years, your local Liberal Democrat team has been winning increasing support from local people who appreciate that we're making things happen here. So join us in voting Lib Dem and let's demand better and go greener for Brighton Hill.",
