It is a great local start up success story, serving cask and keg beers from an onsite taproom as well as Kentish wines, cider, and coffee. Local micropubs in the constituency, such as the Dead Pigeon and Wolfe and Castle, regularly host their beers, offering Medway drinkers a taste of Medway in their local.\nBarry Watts from the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) also joined the visit. He welcomed announcements in the recent Budget which increased Draught Relief from 9.2% to 13.9% from 1 February, as well as an increase in the differential in the Small Producer Relief which specifically assists small breweries. They discussed what the new government’s overhaul of business rates should look like to support the industry, as well as securing Moot a spot as a guest beer at the Houses of Parliament bar in the near future.",

Universal free breakfast clubs are central to Labour’s Plan for Change, removing barriers to opportunity by making sure every child starts the school day ready to learn.\nLauren Edwards MP for Rochester and Strood, said:\n“I am absolutely delighted that St Helen’s CEP in Cliffe has been selected as one of the first schools to benefit from free breakfast clubs. I hope to visit the school later in the year to see the positive benefits the scheme has provided for children’s learning”.\n“My government is determined to break down the barriers to children achieving their full potential. We know that hungry children struggle to learn, so the government’s free breakfast clubs will help all children to get the most out of their education.”",

The MPs will meet with other interested parties, including Virgin and Evolyn in the coming weeks to discuss this further.\nThe meeting with the Rail Minister followed an opportunity Lauren and other MPs had to speak with the Eurostar Chief Executive in Parliament last week.\nCommenting on the productive discussions with the Minister, Lauren said:\n“Today’s meeting was encouraging, with the Rail Minister fully appreciating the economic boost our region would get from restoring international rail services from Kent stations.\nIt cost UK taxpayers £3bn to develop the Eurostar service and yet we have facilities at Ashford and Ebbsfleet stations that are being wasted, forcing Kent passengers to travel to London unnecessarily and at great cost.\nThe previous Conservative government sold the UK’s 40% stake in Eurostar back in 2015 for only £757m so the current government lacks the leverage it once had to influence the provision of Eurostar services.\nI’m delighted the new Labour government is listening to me and the people of Medway and Kent by already working hard to see how we can open the international rail lines up to competitors and restore services in Kent.\nThere is a big appetite amongst residents in Rochester and Strood to bring international rail back to Kent and I’ll continue to work hard with other Labour MPs in our region to make this happen.”",

During the debate, she called for a more integrated health and social care system and said she hoped that future Budgets would allow charitable care homes such as Frindsbury House to be eligible for the same exemptions given to the NHS.\nLauren commented:\n“It was a pleasure to be asked to formally open the new lift at Frindsbury House and to have the opportunity to meet with staff, residents and volunteers from the Mortimer Society.\n“This facility is a crucial part of the residential care landscape in Rochester and Strood providing important community-based care to residents. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to learn more about how they help people with neurological conditions such as Huntington’s disease.\n“I was also pleased to highlight their fantastic work during the Budget debate in the House of Commons, where I also called for a more integrated health and social care systems and for charitable care homes to be eligible for the same exemptions as the NHS in future Budgets.”",

She was incredibly pleased to hear the government later announce plans to inject over £600 million into technical skills, aiming to train up to 60,000 new engineers, bricklayers, electricians, and carpenters by 2029.\nThis significant investment will also establish ten new technical colleges, providing teachers with the latest resources and equipment. This initiative is designed to prepare a generation capable of building 1.5 million houses over the next five years and transitioning to a green economy.\nBy increasing the supply of homes, the plan aims to make affordable housing a reality while redeveloping brownfield land to rejuvenate communities. This approach not only supports economic growth but also revitalizes underused sites, ensuring towns evolve into more inclusive, sustainable, and vibrant places to live.\nIn Rochester and Strood, local colleges are already doing amazing work for young people and boosting skills not just in construction but in a wide range of sectors. This investment will enable them to progress even further. MidKent College, for instance, has been granted over £1.7 million in capital spending as part of a Department for Education scheme to help colleges prepare for the future.\nBoth the new funding for construction skills and for college capital spending are strong ways in which the new government is delivering for Rochester and Strood.",

Joint CEOs Shibani Mohindra and Suzanne Powell and Business Development Manager Lee Robinson explained Celessence’s trademark microencapsulation technology, showed Lauren around the factory and introduced her to the rest of the team.\nCelessence works with globally leading brands to enhance their textiles with natural scents, oils, and even anti-microbial properties. Celessence’s microcapsules once applied to textiles break down slowly over time, ensuring the benefits they bring to textiles are long-lasting.\nReflecting on the visit, Lauren said\n“It was fascinating to learn more about this world-leading technology that is manufactured right here in Rochester and Strood and exported across the globe. Celessence are clearly an SME that punches above its weight led by two experienced and dedicated businesswomen. In my role as their MP, I’m looking to support them further in my work on skills and apprenticeships and learn more about how SMEs like Celessence can offer great manufacturing careers for young people.”",

The £1.6 billion investment to repair road networks in England is an increase of nearly 50% on local road maintenance funding from last year – going well beyond the Government’s manifesto pledge and is enough to fix the equivalent of over seven million extra potholes nationally in 2025/26.\nAcross England, local highways authorities will receive a 40% uplift in funding on average as the Government looks to rebuild Britain as part of its Plan for Change. Fixing our roads and filling potholes not only makes roads safer, but they also improve journey times and save drivers money from avoidable repairs. It comes as figures from the RAC show drivers in Rochester and Strood bear the cost of pothole damage to vehicles is around £500 on average a year, with more severe repairs costing considerably more. According to the AA, fixing potholes is a priority for 96 per cent of drivers.\nThis Labour Government is delivering its Plan for Change with investment and reform to deliver growth, improving living standards in Rochester and Strood and across the country by putting more money in people’s pockets and rebuilding Britain.\nLauren commented on the increased funding: “I am delighted that this Labour Government is doing things differently and taking swift action to fix our roads. Drivers have been plagued by potholes for too long, after 14 long years of Tory neglect. Under the Conservatives the situation spiralled out of control, with pothole damage costing drivers almost £500 million.”\n”The impact of this funding will be seen by residents, with journeys across Rochester and Strood made safer, quicker and cheaper for drivers. This announcement goes well beyond the promises we made in our manifesto at the last election and shows that we’re serious about our Plan for Change.",

Cathedral Pie wants to preserve and celebrate the iconic dish of Cockney culture and put it on the map alongside other recognized British staples, such as Cornish pasties and Wensleydale Cheese.\nTraditional Pie’n’Mash consists of a meat pie served with mashed potatoes, and parsley sauce called ‘liquor’. It has a heritage dating back to the 1840s and remains a staple of Cockney cuisine enjoyed by the ‘Cockney diaspora’ across South-East England.\nLauren emphasised the significance of preserving the heritage of traditional British foods.\n“Pie’n’Mash is more than a meal; it’s a proud symbol of Cockney culture and tradition. Recognition through Protected Food Status will not only safeguard its authenticity but also ensure for future generations can experience the true taste of this British classic.\nI was pleased to taste for myself the delicious Pie’n’Mash served by George to residents and tourists alike on Rochester High Street and recommend a visit. I’m strongly backing this campaign which will properly recognise the culinary heritage of this fantastic food eaten for centuries in the UK.”\nGeorge Jupp, owner of the Cathedral Pie House, stressed the importance of the recognition. “In other countries, unique foods are celebrated as essential part of their culture. Pie’n’Mash deserves the same respect. This isn’t just about tradition. It’s about celebrating a confident future for our favourite food”",

Despite the challenging financial inheritance from the last government, she was pleased to see a Labour government turn the page on decline with a budget that puts working people first and begins to repair our public services.\nInformed by Lord Darzi’s assessment of the state of the NHS, the budget lays the foundation to take the NHS from the analogue to digital, from hospital to community-led care and from treating sickness to a renewed focus on prevention and promoting good health.\nShe also called for an elective care centre in Chatham High Street in her constituency, requesting further conversations with the Health Secretary having written to him with this proposal shortly after being elected.\nAs well as freeing up space at Medway Maritime hospital and helping to tackle long waiting lists, this would bring back into use a large building which has stood empty for several years, boosting footfall in the town centre and supporting regeneration efforts.\nLauren commented:\n“This Labour government has put working people first in a budget which fixes the foundations of our economy and rebuilds our public services. We are providing record levels of investment in the National Health Service which will be targeted at slashing waiting lists and making it easier to access the care you need”.\n“I took the opportunity to highlight the fantastic opportunity we have to open a new Elective Care Centre in the old Debenhams building in Chatham High Street. This investment would provide better access to a range of treatments and reduce waiting lists and current pressures on Medway Maritime Hospital”.\n“I will continue to press the Health Secretary to support this proposal so that we can both improve health services for residents and support our town centres”.",

This raised nearly £5.8m for more than 22,000 schools across the UK last year – including £13,691 shared between 33 primary schools across Rochester and Strood.\nLauren heard more about the scheme, the first of its kind, and was briefed on the work of Parentkind, Asda’s Community Champions, and the Asda Foundation. She also took the opportunity to meet with senior staff from ASDA to discuss their apprenticeships programme and how the government could make changes to improve completion rates and encourage more businesses to invest in their staff.\nSpeaking about the drop-in, Lauren said:\n“With a large ASDA store in Strood and two smaller convenience stores in my constituency, I was pleased to attend the event to thank ASDA staff on behalf of our schools and celebrate the success of Cashpot for Schools. It’s great that over £13,000 has gone to local schools to invest in projects and support our young people. Further funding rounds will open soon, and I encourage even more schools to put in bids for 2025!\n“It was also helpful to hear that ASDA has millions of pounds that it can’t use to train staff because of the rigidity of the current apprenticeship system. As Co-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Skills, Careers and Employment, I’ll be pushing to make sure Labour’s overhaul of apprenticeships in this country makes them simpler, more flexible and led by employers, so that this money can be used to invest in the workforce.”",

Their sacrifices strengthen our nation and keep us safe. But too many veterans find themselves in vulnerable situations, facing challenges such as homelessness, unemployment, and difficulty accessing the help they need. With an estimated 6,000 veterans in the UK lacking a permanent home, the reality is both stark and unacceptable.\nIn March 2025, thousands of people across the country will take part in this remarkable campaign. Participants will spend a night outdoors, an experience that reflects some of the hardships that our homeless veterans endure daily. The event is organized by the Royal British Legion Industries (RBLI), who provide dedicated support for our armed forces.\nFor me, taking part in this sleep-out is a way of supporting those who have faced life-changing challenges after serving our nation. I know our local community does a lot to help veterans navigate the complexities of returning to civilian life. However, there remains a significant gap between the support offered and the actual needs of many veterans. It is our responsibility to bridge this gap.\nI am proud to that our Labour government is treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve, with over £4m being allocated to help end veteran homelessness. We have continued to champion the rights and well-being of our armed forces, advocating for measures to ensure that no veteran is left behind. From government commitments to provide secure housing solutions, to initiatives that promote better access to mental health services, Labour’s proactive approach is making a tangible difference.\nThe Great Tommy Sleep Out is an opportunity to highlight the message that every veteran deserves to be supported with dignity and respect. I encourage everyone to learn more about the issues facing our veterans and to get involved in any way they can – whether that means donating, volunteering, or simply raising awareness.\nIf you would like to donate to my sleep out you can do so at the following link. https://www.justgiving.com/page/lauren-edwards-mp?utm_medium=FR&utm_source=CL\nFind out more about the Sleep Out here: https://rbli.co.uk/rbli-events/the-great-tommy-sleep-out/",

This includes 317 homes in the Rochester and Strood constituency.\nThis plan to fix military housing is a major deal to bring the Armed Forces housing estate back into public ownership with billions of pounds being saved by the deal over the next decade, delivering savings for taxpayers and enabling additional investment into homes for military families.\nThe landmark move reverses a sale undertaken by the then Government in 1996, which meant billions of pounds has been spent renting back military homes that they shouldn’t have sold in the first place. Across the country, thousands of forces’ families are living with damp, mould and leaks after more than a decade of underinvestment in maintenance and repairs of these ageing homes.\nLauren commented:\n“I am delighted that the government has acted in the interests of both military families in Rochester and Strood and the taxpayer to secure this deal.\n“Military families, like those in our close-knit Brompton community, deserve high standards of accommodation and by taking back ownership we can ensure that they are warm, safe and good quality.\n“Taking back control of the military housing estate also makes sense for the taxpayer – doing so will save the £230 million a year in rent or £600,000 per day.”",
