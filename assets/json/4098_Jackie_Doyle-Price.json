So too will trips to Upminster.\nThese charges could see some people having to pay more than £60 a week if they want to continue using their car to get to work.”\nThe Mayor claims that this is about improving air quality but it seems to be more about revenue raising to me.”",

  "http_www_jackiedoyleprice_com_/http_www_jackiedoyleprice_com_news_keir-starmers-honeymoon-over/content_3.html": "Keir Starmer is finding that Government is really not as easy as it looks. It is quite staggering just how quickly the honeymoon period has expired. It is all beautifully summarised in Rosie Duffield’s letter to the Prime Minister as she voluntarily resigned the whip.\nIt is fair to say that Rosie Duffield has had a difficult relationship with the Party leadership due to her outspoken views on gender. Her firm belief that men cannot become women and that women’s rights and safe spaces need to be protected is a mainstream position which would be supported by the vast majority of British people. Yet it is a controversial position within today’s Labour Party. Rosie Duffield’s assertion that only women have a cervix was condemned by Starmer as something that should not have been said. It took the intervention of Tony Blair to state that a woman has a a vagina and a man has a penis before Starmer acknowledged that he agreed with what Blair said. Far be it for him to listen to the concerns of his female Parliamentary colleagues. But as Duffield’s letter states, it isn’t just that. It is about leadership style and the choices that Labour in Government have chosen to make.\nMany Labour MPs were uncomfortable with the withdrawal of the winter fuel allowance. In the event the rebellion was muted due to activity by the whips. Labour in Government have already shown ruthlessness in withdrawing the whip from rebels. Clearly with a huge majority this is a luxury it has. But it is a poor look to be cutting benefits for the most vulnerable while enjoying thousands of pounds of freebies from donors and lobbyists.\nIt has been amusing to watch the incredulous expression on the face of Keir Starmer and his ministers as they have been questioned about the gifts. The attacks they dish out to their opponents are considered out of order when put to them. It is as if they are so morally superior to their opponents that it doesn’t occur to them that some of this just looks wrong. Let’s be frank. Who wouldn’t take corporate hospitality when offered? And why shouldn’t a football club offer free hospitality in order to have contact with the n action’s decision makers? But when you are in public life you have to regulate your own actions. And be honest about it when you do take gifts.\nWhen I was an MP I took a very liberal position on tobacco. I was often invited to take hospitality from tobacco companies. I always declined as I did not want to have the suggestion that my position had been influenced by it. Keir Starmer clearly likes football. If someone offers him hospitality in a corporate box, why shouldn’t he take it, provided it is all publicly declared? This nonsense that he can no longer sit in the stands just makes him look shifty. Ultimately Keir Starmer is a career public servant who has moved into Politics. And I all in favour of that. But in making the journey he has, he does not share the political experience which many of his Parliamentary colleagues have. And it shows.\nThe appointment of Sue Gray is a perfect example. It is not surprising that this has ended as it has. It is one thing appointing someone with experience of Whitehall to oversee transition into Government. But politics is about more than public sector management. The appointment of Patrick Vallance as a Minister shows a belief in bureaucratic leadership which will jar with Labour MPs who have worked hard and waited for government. And to see newly elected colleagues parachuted into Government without having even made a maiden speech is offensive to Labour MPs and contemptuous of Parliament.\nIt’s a pretty poor start to be frank. It isn’t impossible for Labour to get its act together. If it doesn’t it is going to be a long four and a half years.",

  "http_www_jackiedoyleprice_com_/http_www_jackiedoyleprice_com_news_fuel-costs-winter/content_8.html": "You will be aware that the Government is intervening to make sure that no one faces crippling increases in their fuel bills. Here is the detail:\nEssentially the Government has placed a ceiling on what energy companies can charge their customers. The method by which it delivers this will depend on the kind of tariff you are on but essentially it is applied to each kilowatt hour. Based on current prices this intervention will save the typical household as much as £1000 this year and up to £4000 next year. Businesses will also be receiving help. I am aware that many shops, cafes, restaurants and bars were worrying about whether they would be able to sustain their businesses. They will receive a discount which will see them pay less than half what the Bills would be under current prices\nThe Government is also giving every household £400 towards the cost of their bills. This will be delivered through six instalments between October and March.\nYou do not need to do anything to obtain these discounts. They are automatic and will be deducted from your bills. So if you do receive any texts or emails asking that you register for the help then these will be scammers and fraudsters. Any texts can be forwarded to 7726 or emailed to [email protected] for investigation by the National Cyber security centre\nThese schemes will run from October through to March and will then be reviewed but we are committed to intervening in energy policies for the next two years. We will also ensure we do more to generate energy here in the UK so that the world is less exposed to the actions of evil tyrants. Putin’s aggression towards Ukraine is at the root of these problems. His actions have had the effect of pushing up global energy prices which has forced up the cost of all our bills. Rest assured we will continue to take action to address this. We are a great nation and we can overcome this. We have been through worse."
