I had walked along to the 'Times' Office to see the coloured photographs of Charles and yourself displayed in the window. Behind me two girls were also looking and I heard one say - 'Doesn't she look young! You could take her for Princess Elizabeth couldn't you. But it's like her isn't it.' Who these people were I don't know, but I felt fully in agreement with their observations.\nMoreover, I had all day been connecting you in my mind with another royal personage - The Duchess of Kent.\nWhen I looked at you, that is who I felt strongly reminded of. And I thought that even the Duchess of Kent at her very best could not have looked smarter. I think you struck a most perfect note, and nothing nicer could have been turned-out by even the like of Norman Hartnell you looked perfectly and truly 'swell'.\nThere were two other women I also admired. One was Mrs Marshall - to whom I would apply the word 'chic'.\nThe other, I don't know who it was, but she was shortish, a little elderly and she was dressed in a soft blue. It was not the clothes, but the very beautiful triple row of pearls she was wearing. They were lovely.\nAltogether Dorothy I thought it was a grand day and very enjoyable. A very tiring one for you both and I expect you were glad when you were quietly back at home. If there is ever any little thing I can do such as minding house or anything at all, please know that I should only be too glad to help, and never hesitate to let me know.\nGood luck, good health and a very happy year to you\nboth. with love, Reg\n1949_Death_Certificate_Emma_MILLER.pdf\nRegistration District, Colchester | Death in the Sub-district of Clacton in the County of\nEssex.\nNo 47 | Sixteenth December 1949, Heath House, Tendring RD\nEmma MILLER | Female | 88 yrs\nOccupation, Of Leaches Lane, Colchester U.D.

There is mystery surrounding this photo and that successive generations believed that Uncle Reg was a senior officer within the Territorial Army.\nMartin MILLER, whose grandfather Frederick was Reg's older brother writes Reginald Miller was in the 1WW as a lieutenant. He served in the Indian Army\nafter 1918. I think he served in Malaya and Borneo\nas a Colonel in 1953.\nMichael LUMSDEN whose grandmother was Ethel Beeching writes Reg achievied the rank of Lieutenant Colonel:\nif he had one promotion a year until 1945 that\nwould make him a lieutenant (indicated by the\ntwo pips) in 1942. So I would place the photo\nbetween 1940-42, but it could plausibly be earlier\nif he was an officer in the TA.\nI have not found anyone by the name Reginald MILLER who fits his description within 'Despatches' or any other army record which would confirm Uncle Reg did any military service. I think there is a possiblity he may have borrowed my grandfather CH GIBSON's uniform when he was staying at one of his houses during the war, and later enjoyed telling tall stories to young nephews!\n1940_Death_Certificate_Alfred_MILLER.pdf\nDeath in the Sub-district of Colchester in the County\nof Essex.\nNo 173 |\nTenth March 1940, 14 Popes Lane U.D.\nAlfred Charles MILLER | Male | 80 yrs\nOccupation, Of 23, Studds Lane, Mile End, Colchester U.D.\n- formerly Station Master.\nCause of Death, 1(a) Myocardial Degeneration, 11 Senile\nDementia | Certified by W.F.

It turned out that I was at the right\npub, they changed the street names in the 1920's. On the\nwall of the pub was a framed history. It had Alfred Charles\nas Landlord from 1913-15, it said he was 'called\nup'. As he would have been 55 yrs old, I presume\nit was not to the military but back to the Railway.

It was named after the numerous chalk springs at the site which fed the river Medway. The new mill was designed using the latest technologies available which included steam power and an on-site laboratory. Balston had previously been in partnership with the brothers Thomas, Robert and Finch Hollingworth and together they had bought the world famous ‘J Whatman’ papermaking business.\nJames Whatman had started manufacturing paper in 1733 on the river Len at Pole Mill in Boxley. He later moved the main production to Turkey Mill where James his son developed the technique of 'wove' and paper whitening processes using bleach.\nTurkey Mill and Springfield Mill, although now competitors, both had the copy rights to manufacture and sell 'J Whatman' papers which continued to have tremendous international prestige.\nWilliam Balston's two sons bought the 'Turkey Mill' version of the watermark in 1859.\n1861_Birth_Certificate_Emma_BEECHING.pdf\nBirth in the Sub-district of East Maidstone in the County of Kent.\nNo 374 | Twenty Fifth November 1861, Perryfield Street.\nEmma | Girl\nName of Father, Edwin Thomas BEECHING | Occupation of Father, Papermaker (Journeyman)\nName of Mother, Helen BEECHING formerly PIPER.\nDescription of Informant, Edwin Thomas BEECHING, Father, Perryfield Street, Maidstone\nWhen Registered, Nineteenth December 1861 | Registrar, Edwin RUCK\n1861_Census_Edwin_Helen_BEECHING.pdf\nRG9 | Piece 503 | Folio 113 | Page 17 | Perryfield Street, Maidstone, Kent\nEdwin T BEECHING | Head | Married | 28 yrs | Occupation,\nPaper Maker | Born; Maidstone, Kent\nHelen BEECHING | Wife | Married | 27 yrs | Born, Basted,\nKent\nEdwin N BEECHING | Son | 5 yrs | Born, Maidstone, Kent\nHelen BEECHING | Daughter | 3 yrs | Born, Maidstone,\nKent\n1860_Birth_Certificate_Alfred_C_MILLER.pdf\nBirth in the District of Ramsgate in the County of Kent\nNo 205 | Twenty First December 1859, Southwood, St Lawrence.\nAlfred Charles | Boy\nName of Father, Thomas MILLER | Occupation of Father, Railway Guard\nName of Mother, Esther MILLER formerly BELSEY\nDescription of Informant, Esther MILLER, Mother, Southwood, St Lawrence\nWhen Registered, Twenty Fifth January 1860 |\nRegistrar, John POWELL\n1859_Marriage_Certificate_BEECHING_WEEDON.pdf\n1859 Marriage solomnizes at Trinity Church in the Parish of Maidstone in the County of Kent\nNo 239 | When married, 15 January\nFrederick Nelson BEECHING | 21 yrs | Bachelor\nProfession, Papermaker | Residence, Thornhill Place\nFather's Name, Thomas BEECHING | Profession of Father, Papermaker\nCharlotte WEEDON | 21 yrs | Spinster\nResidence, Luarey Road\nFather's Name, George WEEDON | Profession of Father, Papermaker\nMarried in the Trinity Church according to the Rites and ceremonies of the Established Church, by Certificate by me, FFW GLYNN\nThis Marriage was solemnized between us, Frederick Nelson BEECHING, Charlotte WEEDON X her mark\nIn the Presence of us, Halice (Hillier?)

John Ford fixed the leg, as I heard later.\nCirca 1913 Henrietta Day PIGOTT studio photo | On the back of the photo Olive WANSEY nee BRAMHALL,\nher daughter has written Great Grandmother (nee PIGOTT), Henrietta Day Born 26th June 1892, Married William BRAMHALL March 13th 1917\nFive children, Godfrey Hugh William Dec 5 1917 | Olive Washburn July 16 1921 |\nJohn Douglas Born April 20 1924 Died Dec 1924 |\nJoan Henrietta November 20 1925 |\n(Bunty) Joyce Megan August 9 1927 |\nDied December 22 1971\n1911_Census_PIGOTT_Family.pdf\nRG14 | Enumeration 23 | District 23 | Piece 9697 |\n71, Greenleaf Road, Walthamstow, London\nJohn PIGOTT | Head | Married | 53 yrs | Occupation, Manager Of Uniform Stores | Born, Farringdon Berks\nEliza Matthews PIGOTT | Wife | Married | 49 yrs | Total Children Born Alive, 6 | Children Still Living, 3 | Born, Newcastle Staffordshire\nHenrietta Day PIGOTT | Daughter | Single | 18 yrs | Occupation, Shorthand And Typist Occupation, | Born, Clapton London N E\nJohn William Vincent PIGOTT | Son | Single | 17 yrs | Occupation, Dental Manufacturers And Merchant Apprentice | Born, Newcastle Staff\nDouglas Randolph Oldaker PIGOTT | Son | 10 yrs | Occupation, School Boy | Born, Walthamstow Essex\nCirca 1905 Richard PIGOTT (Bn 1827 Dd 1921)\nCirca 1894 Eliza Matthews PIGOTT nee LINDOP [Xanthe's maternal great-great-great grandmother]\n1901_Census_PIGOTT_Family.pdf\nRG13 | Piece 1623 | Folio 102 | Page 4 |\n4, Verulam Avenue, Walthamstow, Essex\nJohn PIGOTT | Head | Married | 43 yrs | Occupation, Salvation Army Officer (Secretary) | Born, Faringdon, Berkshire\nEliza M PIGOTT | Wife | Married | 39 yrs | Born, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire\nHenrietta D PIGOTT | Daughter | 8 yrs | Born, London\nJohn W V PIGOTT | Son | 7 yrs | Born, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire\nDouglas R O PIGOTT | Son | 3 months | Walthamstow, Essex\nAutobiographies of John PIGOTT 1858-1931 and Eliza Matthews PIGOTT nee LINDOP 1858-1831 written by their grandson Godfrey Hugh William BRAMHALL\n1891_PIGOTT_LINDOP_Autobiographies_Original.pdf\n1891_PIGOTT_LINDOP_Autobiographies_Transcript.pdf\n1892_Birth_Certificate_Henrietta_Day_PIGOTT.pdf\n1892 Birth in the Sub-district of Hackney in the County\nof London\nNo 295 | When and where, Twenty Sixth June 1892, 24, Linscott\nRoad\nHenrietta Day PIGOTT | Girl\nName of father, John PIGOTT | Occupation of father, Evangelist Salvation Army\nName of mother, Eliza Matthews PIGOTT formerly LINDOP\nDescription of informant, Jno PIGOTT, Father, 24, Linscott\nRoad, Lower Clapton\nWhen registered, Twenty second July 1892 |\nT COATES, Registrar\n1891_Marriage_Certificate_PIGOTT_LINDOP.pdf\n1891 Marriage solemnized at Matthews Church, in the\nParish of Hackney in the County of London\nNo 466 | July 22nd 1891\nJohn PIGOTT | 33 yrs | Bachelor | Occupation, Salvation Army Officer\nResidence at time of Marriage, Cornkiln Road\nFather's Name, John PIGOTT | Profession of Father, ?\nEliza Mattthews LINDOP | 30 yrs | Spinster\nResidence at time of Marriage, Newcastle under Lyme\nFather's Name, William LINDOP |\nProfession of Father, Brush Maunfacturer\nMarried in the Church of St Matthews according to the\nRites and Ceremonies of the Established Church, by Licence\nby me, H BUSDEN\nThis Marriage was solemnized between us, John PIGOTT,\nEliza Mattthews LINDOP in the Presence of us, William\nDrummond JASTOM, Elizabeth Emma LINDOP\n1891_Census_John_PIGOTT.pdf\nRG12 | Piece 1991 | Folio 118 | Page 16 | 10, Brightons Place, Fishpond Road, Stapleton, Gloucestershire\nSamuel Chas GARRATT | Head | Married | 32 yrs | Occupation, Railway Signal Fitter | Born, Derby, Derbyshire.\nAnne GARRATT | Wife | Married | 38 yrs | Born, Spondon, Derbyshire\nChas Wesley GARRATT | Son | 6 yrs | Occupation, Scholar | Born, Rotherham, Yorkshire\nEmma Eliza GARRATT | Daughter | 5 yrs | Occupation, Scholar | Born, Kimberworth, Yorkshire\nAnnie GARRATT | Daughter | 2 yrs | Born, Masbrough, Yorkshire\nEva Rayner GARRATT | Daughter 1 yr | Born, Fishponds, Gloucestershire\nMary Jane RAYNES | Sister | Single | 22 yrs | Born, Breaston, Derbyshire\nJohn PIGOTT | Visitor | Single | 33 yrs | Occupation, Salvation Army Officer | Born, Faringdon, Berkshire\nCirca 1890 Robert PIGOTT (Bn 1830 Dd 1902)\nCirca 1884 Sarah COLLETT nee PIGOTT (Bn 1834 Dd 1899)\n1884 The 'Skeleton Army' attacking the Salvation Army meeting place in Worthing.\n1884 The 'Skeleton Army' attacking Mr HEAD's shop in Montague Street.

When I've been asked 'where are you standing this time' I've enjoyed rolling it out looking for any sign of recognition? I'm glad it wasn't called 'Camden' as that would be far too obvious! Chinners and Knigel Knapp came to my rescue once again in my bid for the parliamentary seat.They connected me with local party supporter Joshua 'Mad Hatter' Mallinson who is on the party's lunatic fringe and a crazy fireball of insanity.\nJoshua collected many nominating signatures on beer mats which may not have cut the mustard with the Camden Elections department and after a couple of phone calls and emails did it all again, seamlessly, on the appropriate form.Most amazingly, all bar one of the original signatories tallied as registered voters so it would seem that the noble 'Tapping the Admiral' drinkers are very conscientious democratic citizens.\nI delivered my papers to the elections department on the 4th June with the help of Bootleg Richard and afterwards we met reporter Dan with Joshua and my campaign was launched with a piece in the Camden Journal and an interview with Lembit Öpik (7 min from the start)\nBefore I knew it my campaign was over and I was sitting in the Diwana Bhel Poori House having a lovely curry with my large group of counting agents all keen to see a loony landslide. We had a shortcut through Euston Station, a foray into Wetherspoons 'The Captain Fliders', and another shortcut through St Pancras Station. Then we were welcomed into the count at Camden Council's new very snazzy venue at 5, Holborn Place and what a great night it was.\nI came eighth out of twelve candidates and was the first to shake Kier's hand after the declaration!\n2nd Apr Election Agent for Howling Laud at Blackpool By-election\nIt's an odd drive to Blackpool, beautiful from where I live in Kirk Ireton round Buxton over the moors to Macclesfield, and then hideous from then on! I collected the signatures in Waterloo, Blackpool on the 3rd Apr in very cold drizzle right next to 'The Big One' roller coaster. I was very pleased later that day to be rising up the road from Macclesfield to the 'Cat & Fiddle' high up in the hills.\nThe declaration was quite late, almost everyone in the Blackpool Sports Centre were completely exhausted by 5am and I was pleased to get to bed!\n29th Feb Election Agent for Raving Rodent Subortna at Rochdale By-election\nThe count had a physical atmosphere with the green walls of the Rochdale Leisure Centre reflecting on all surfaces. The counting tellers rolled bundles of ballots into tubes of twenty five and planted them into potting trays which were beautifully displayed in front of the main entrance into the hall. As the evening rolled on it became increasingly clear that the ‘Circus of George’ had once again won the day. It is always accepted practise for the winning candidate to turn up with great ceremony shortly before the declaration and George didn't disappoint, he vigorously shook the Rodent’s hand and was very pleased with his result.The Loony crew took up position at the back of the stage and were right next to the lady throwing orange confetti and shouting 'stop the oil'.\nAnother fabulous night in the loonyverse.\n15th Feb 2024 Candidate at Wellingborough By-election\nThe drive down to Wellingborough to submit the nomination papers on 17th Jan was a tough one. The police closed the M1 both ways and re-routed traffic around the outskirts of Leicester, I was later told that a woman had threatened to jump off a bridge. I'm guessing six thousand people were involved in the two and half hour gridlock, which totals about 15,000 waking hours.\nIt was a bitterly cold day as I touted for my ten nominations but the residents of Kilnway were very friendly and it took me about two hours to collect the signatures including a spare which turned out handy as along the way I had collected the autograph of a EU national although there had been no indication in my register. I was kept in the North Northamptonshire council offices reception foyer when I submitted my papers to Heather, which I found a bit disconcerting. Normally I am accustomed to a walk through the elections department and the process, which includes paying the deposit, takes place in an office. Later I checked in to the Northamptonshire Telegraph where their beautiful reporter Alison put me through my paces asking awkward questions like 'why do you do it?'\nI had a thoroughly excellent time standing in Wellingborough, it was my fifth by-election. I had a great team supporting me with Howling Laud, RU Seerius, Hell ‘n Bak, Gilly, Sir Archibald, Ringo and Allan the monk. We had a lot of discussion about campaign tactics, and carefully constructed strategies were developed in ‘The Earl of Dalkeith’ Wetherspoons pub in the last few hours of the polling day on the 15th of February. We arrived at the Kettering Conference Centre for the election count around midnight buoyed by a lot of very good ideas and confident of success! The count was warm and very well organised, beautifully set out, and there was a Zen like atmosphere of absolute calm. Kingswood, our twin election near Bristol, declared around two o’clock, after which our count entered into ‘dreamtime’ while the North Northamptonshire Elections department called on ancestral spirits to find a lost bundle of ten ballots. Even Gilly was quieter than usual becoming virtually horizontal.\nThe elections team had clearly thought out every move for when the count was declared and were very organised and precise about where they wanted the candidates, their agents and the journalists to be. I stood next to Helen Harrison who seemed to be very relieved to have lost! We had a lovely time at the Wellingborough count, but I’m hoping that the Rochdale by-election and the ‘Circus of George’ being held in two weeks time will be a little bit more chaotic!\n19th Oct 2023 Election Agent for Howling Laud at Tamworth By-election\nIt rained on the drive down, and continued when I collected the register from the Tamworth council offices. The 14th Sept was a very wet day but the moment I arrived on Bancroft Road the rain stopped. The residents of Glascote welcomed me dressed in my large top hat, yellow ‘recycled teenager’ T-shirt and adorned lab coat and saw little reason not to nominate Howling Laud as their hopeful representative. I collected the signatures of ten registered voters within an hour and within seconds of Amy offering the tenth endorsement the rain started again!\nGilly, Archie, Tony Davies, Helen 'Bak, RU Seerius, The Good Knight Sir NosDa, Brick, Ringo\nAll the elections staff at Tamworth were very polite and extremely friendly and led by regular defeater of gravity ‘sky god’ Andrew Barratt.\nThe night before election day Howling Laud our party leader and candidate lost the use of his legs. The following day he was ambulanced to Burton Hospital where he continued to run the campaign. Having spent ten days in the constituency Howling had a good knowledge of the town centre hostelries so he directed us to meet at The Blue Water Indian Restaurant which was one of the finer curries I have ever tasted. Later we spent a happy time at The Market Vaults where we enjoyed listening to live music.\nGilly recognised that our group required leadership and calmly assumed charge, so when we arrived at Rawlett School, where the count was being held, we all cheered him into the room. I visited Howling in Burton Hospital the following morning on my way home and the following Tuesday when I met his lovely sister Mary, who had travelled down from Crewe on the train.\n29th Sep 2023 Loony Conference at The Neuadd Arms Hotel, Llanwrtyd Wells\nThe only time I had been to Llanwrtyd Wells was when we filmed for the Welsh Assembly election broadcast in 2016. I had forgotten how small it is! Friday night was wonderful with the Becca O'Hara band recommended by Lily the Pink and on Saturday morning I sought out the Sulphur Spring which was somehow a medieval experience!\nOn Saturday\nGripper and the Gurnards performed a 45 minute set with the awesome Debs our new singer and we finished our set with three Pistols sung by a zombie formerly known as Chinners. I drank more than I have since my 50th birthday and was almost certainly disgraceful. I have far too many limbs when I dance and was probably terrifying. If anyone is reading this looking for details to pass onto to the assassin I can only apologise and promise I will never dance again!\n20th July 2023 Election Agent for Sir Archibald Stanton at Selby & Ainsty By-election\nIt took me a while to find Selby Council Offices as they were a modern building disguised as a hospital. Later in the morning I met Archie after finding our nominations earlier in and around Charles Street. Selby has been swallowed up by North Allerton Unitary Council and the staff who took charge of our nomination submission had a corporate imperious manner while the lady they pushed aside from Selby Council was personable and wholly far more elegant.\nGilly just wouldn’t stop talking on the night of the Selby election.\nWe all met at The Giant Bellflower in Selby and enjoyed listening to Gilly nattering away. The locals were very friendly in the Wetherspoons and wholeheartedly embraced us.\nAt the end of the night Gilly was very excited to be on stage and chattered away ten to the dozen, but he didn’t seem to effect the Labour Party's winning candidate Keir Mather’s stride, they both made heartfelt acceptance speeches. Archie is very empathetic to Gilly and seemed untroubled about him stealing the night!\n9th Feb 2023 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at West Lancashire By-election.\nI worry when I am driving to a by-election to find the ten nominations and sumbit the papers. I always think, 'this is the one where I will fail'. The drive to Ormskirk has a long stretch of 'smart road' up the M6. My old Hyundai Sant Fe 2002 feels like it could conk out at any time and I always fear for my life when there is no hard shoulder. The M6 is particularly terrifying as Highways have set the metal barrier right up to the edge of the road. When I arrived safe and sound I was given almost a rock star welcome by the elections team and I knew that everything was fine!\nI booked a table at Ali's Retaurant on election night which was conveniantly opposite The Hop Vine and only a short walk from the count at the Burscough Racquets and Fitness Centre. We had great turnout of counting agents including my cousin Susie and friend Christopher Robin. Gilly Nicholls was on fire and kept us all entranced with his raising eyebrows and rolling eyes, I reckon he has aspirations to run the Party!\nIt was the friendliest count I have attended only matched by the efficiency and professionalism of the elections team, so much so that they sent me a text while we were embedded in The Hop Vine telling us that the count was moving quickly and we should chivvy along in case we missed it!\nHowling Laud, Gilly Nicholls, Hell 'n Bak, Earl Eaton\n14th Jan 2023 >>Statement of Accounts for 2022<< to the Electoral Commission\n1st Dec 2022 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at City of Chester By-election.\nThe Loony Party nominations came from streets named after romantic poets, the occupants of Tennyson Walk and Shelley Road were extremely welcoming and I had ten signatures within an hour.\nSheikh m' Hand and I went for a tasty curry at The Bombay Palace and rejoined Howling, RU, Helen and Ron at The Wetherspoons 'Bull and Stirrup'. We walked to the Northgate Arena arriving at about 1am and were surprised to find that the count was nearly complete with the declaration only forty minutes or so later.\n23rd Sep 2022 Loony Conference at The Victoria Cafe, Coalville\nThe Loony Party annual conferences are most naturally disorganised. It is rare for anyone to take any meaningful responsibility for the occasion. We are normally based at a pub with a music license and there's a vague hope that a few bands might turn up to entertain us. The Victoria Cafe was an upgrade to the usual model, it has two fully rigged stages with PA and lights and John the owner had booked two big cover bands on both Friday and Saturday nights. We had become professional!\nI did my best to muddle the Friday night by bringing along Gripper & the Gurnards. We were reluctantly given time to play a few songs.\nOn Saturday night The Tiswas Bunny Matthew Butler sang 'Bright Eyes' to a cacophany of kazoos.\n23rd Jun 2022 Election Agent for Sir Archibald Stanton Earl 'Eaton at Wakefield By-election.\nI was pleased when local legends Gilly and his sidekick Sir Archy agreed to stand in the Wakefield by-election, they are more Yorkshire than the Yorkshire Party! Sir Archie sought out all his nominations and all I had to do was meet up with him, for a lift into Wakefield. Sandra Hardy the Electoral Services Manager is a lady of bubbly witty exuberance coupled with careful professionalism. It was a great pleasure to meet her and her team.\nThe Count was held in the Thornes\nPark Stadium. The count was in a cramped room but we were given the freedom of an outside marquee and running track to enjoy the warm summer's night. Gilly was the most diligent counting agent, his photograph starred in a later news piece by the BBC.\n3rd Mar 2022 Election Agent for The Good Knight Sir NosDa at Birmingham Erdington By-election.\nMark aka The Good Knight Sir NosDa has been the Loony Party website's 'technical' department' for some years. When the by-election came up in Birmingham Erdington he was the obvious local candidate. We picked up the nominations on the 4th February in Perry Common and Mark took nomination pack into the Birmingham City Council offices by bus the following Monday, all was good.\nI achieved something I had been meaning to do for some time and listened to all four Dead Kennedys studio albums in the car journeys to Birmingham and back.\nThe Good Knight Sir NosDa, Sam Potts\nWe had a good curry delivered to The Rollason Hotel and rolled up to the count at the Erdington Academy. The three previous by-elections I had attended since Covid had all been very late declaring so I was surprised at how efficient the Birmingham Elections Department were declaring by 2.10am. It was all over so quickly! We enjoyed the company of the Greens and Sam Potts of the Liberal Party who is very experienced with elections and was great company with his political insights and anecdotes.\nHowling rang me in a state of panic the following day after I had driven back to Derbyshire. He had lost his car keys. After a few hours of searching he located them in the counting hall where they had been left on a chair.\n4th Feb 2022 >>Statement of Accounts for 2021<< to the Electoral Commission.\n16th Dec 2021 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at North Shropshire By-election.\nI had a sense of panic when I first looked at the map of the North Shropshire constituency. It is huge and only really three small market towns with the rest of it wholeheartedly rural, but then I found Trevor aka Engelbart Finklestien in our memberships and all was good. All our nominations came from a very friendly and cheerful walk round Linden & Cherry Way in Market Drayton and Trevor is great company.\nWith Sue Austin of the 'Shropshire Star'\nHowling Laud based himself at the Shrewsbury Hotel, which although outside the by election area was a perfect headquarters. I'm not sure if he ever made it into the constituency in all his time there! There was a great atmosphere at the Count which was in the Shrewsbury Sports Village and at 5.30am we crossed over into the bowling alley for the declaration. The Liberal candidate Helen Morgan handsomely trounced the Tory party in a normally safe blue seat.\nRU, Helen'Bak, Englebert Finklestien, Jason, Howling Laud, Flying Brick, Giles\n1st July 2021 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at Batley & Spen By-election.\nWe have a whole team in Dewsbury in the form of Sir Archibald Stanton and his living, breathing side-kick 'Gilly Nicholls'. Gilly is a indomitable politician at night and, when he rests, a ventriloquists dummy by day. Sir Archibald and Gilly collected the nominations for us and I travelled up to submit the papers to the Kirklees Council offices on the 2nd June.\nFarmin' Dave, Flying Brick, RU Seerius, Helen, Sir Archibald Stanton, Howling Laud\nI booked into The Stay Hotel in the centre of Huddersfield for the night of the count. Soon after arriving I was surprised by the incongruous noise and sight of the middle aged owner dressed in full kurta roaring into the front car parking space. He was driving his sleek Lamborghini but it had a 'boy racer' exhaust, what a cacophony!\nIn the evening we met at at Howling’s headquarters the 'Rat & Ratchet'. Howling, Sir Archibald and I went for a great curry next door at the 'Lahori Taste'.\nIt was another long night at the count, Covid has really slowed the whole process down. I was rude to the man from 'Rejoin EU,' he expects us to rejoin through parliamentary manoeuvrings without any further referendum, I told him he was an insurgent.\nAt the end of the night George Galloway was foul to the Acting Returning Officer Jacqui Gedman. He threw his weight about and threatened the Kirklees Council with legal action if they didn't have a full re-count. I am still a bit confused about this as 'The Workers Party', which he leads, had come a clear third. The Tories requested a re-count of some ballot boxes but couldn't find the 300 votes needed to win so conceeded, and then George kicked off in a very agressive fashion while Jacqui was giving us the results.\n6th May 2021 Candidate in the Hartlepool By-election\nIt's a wonderful thing when seventeen years separate two visits but the hospitality and generosity remain the same!\nI must thank my agent George Stuart aka Sir Adrian Wall and his wife Dotty for a first class welcome and all the regulars outside 'The Bowline' on the Marina for a great pre-election victory celebration. The weather was cold but the hospitality was warm. It was a great start to what turned out to be a long but enjoyable Thursday night.\nSeventeen years before in 2004 Peter Mandelson resigned as an MP from Hartlepool to become a European Commissioner. The by-election that followed was the first time I was an election agent for Howling Laud. I had booked into George's hotel to sort out Howling's nomination papers and ever since George met Howling Laud and experienced the Loony political machine he's been a true supporter.\nThis time round neither George or Howling could stand for the Hartlepool by-election so I keenly jumped at the chance. George very kindly offered to collect the nomination signatures from his friends in Hartlepool. This meant I did not have to make the three hour drive up, but of course this and further lack of attendence over the course of the election campaign may have reflected in my poor performance at the polls!\nAll parliamentary by-election counts are different but Hartlepool count was quite exceptionally strange. It was most notable for the length of time the count took and by the end of it the exhaustion of the counting tellers, elections staff and Denise McGuckin the Returning Officer. The only other count I have attended which was so late was in May 2016 for the North Wales Region of the Welsh Assembly. That declaration had been at 7.45am because the Returning Officer Colin Everett and two or three other members of staff had to wait for results from Anglesey. In that instance all the tellers had been sent home and by the declaration the vast leisure centre was bereft of people and those remaining gently dozed. In Hartlepool all the tellers were there and counting, albeit through half closed eyes, right to the end. I can't quite understand why the ballot verification didn't happen till after three in the morning, but at this time I decided that the best course of action was to slip away back to my room in the Douglas Hotel for a couple of hours sleep.\nI instantly slept but woke suddenly at 4.45am and flicked on BBC News to hear the anchor say that they thought the declaration was to take place in fifteen minutes. So running shoes were hastily put on and I pelted back to the count only to still see large piles of ballot papers in the counting booths.\nAt seven in the morning a frazzled Denise McGuckin invited the candidates and election agents to the back of the stage where she showed us a pile of spoilt papers. She suggested to us that the Conservative landslide was so immense and that the hour was so late that there was surely no point in going through them and would we mind stepping up to the stage for the result. Feeling fresh as a daisy I skipped on claiming prize spot!\nIt was a shame to beat the 'Freedom Party' as they were a spirited and young posse. Kernel Coco has told me that I set a new record for the largest number of votes ever cast for any candidate in 14th place in a Parliamentary by-election in the United Kingdom.\n13th Feb 2021 >>Statement of Accounts for 2020<< to the Electoral Commission\n15th Feb 2020 >>Statement of Accounts for 2019<< to the Electoral Commission\n12th Dec 2019 Candidate at Islington North\nin the General Election\nKnigel Knapp, 'Knight of the UnKnown' decided he couldn't stand against Jeremy Corbyn in the general election. Knigel is a cuisinier of Christmas puds and as a result too busy at Yule to meet the challenge. This left me salivating at the prospect, a tempting low hanging fruit ripe for picking! Although excited about standing in Islington North I was also anxious about my chances of successfully securing the nomination. In the end I should not have worried as Chinners found some willing advocates on our Twitter feed. I borrowed my mother's RAV4 for the journey as I had doubts whether my old diesel Hyundai would be popular on the streets of London town. The Town Hall were both open and very friendly allowing me to park outside when I arrived at 8.30am after a fairly gruelling four hour drive. After collecting the electoral roll it was a short drive to Dervish's parking slot pre-arranged on 'yourparkingspace' and he and his husband generously added their two signatures to my nomination form. I met David, my electoral agent and then swiftly collected my remaining signatures on Witherington Road and was finished by mid-morning.\nI rolled back to the Town Hall at midday and Kerry Wickens from the Elections Department was super efficient with my papers. Kerry did make me explain myself over my 'also known as' name 'Nick the Incredible Flying Brick'. I truthfully told her that 'Brick' was the name given to me at school (there were others but this was the least offensive!), which she nodded to. That Howling Laud calls me 'Flying' to which she gave a small shrug. After a small pause I said 'and Manchester Crew call me Incredible' to which she gave me a hard stare! This once again proved to me our democracy will always be safe as long as it remains in the control of our Local Authority electoral departments. Islington_North_Persons_Nominated\nThe Loony Party have a new recruit, Lord Sandy’s of Bunhill who has transferred allegiance from the Green Party. He elected to be our candidate for Islington South and spent the election campaign listening to voters, pundits and other candidates saying he heard a great deal of 'utter rubbish'. He said he heard opinions on everything from Brexit to bins, most of which was ill informed and rarely grounded in fact. I on the other hand spent most of my campaign talking to sheep in Derbyshire!\nThe votes from both constituencies Islington North and Islington South were counted the Sorbell Leisure Centre.\nLord Sandy's and I met for the first time the Round Square Chinese Restaurant on the Thursday night of the count. We had a very filling and tasty meal as the portions were huge. We then walked with our teams to the Count which, although short, took some time due to the impracticable nature our footwear. Lord Sandy’s wore a pair of pink thigh high boots while I sported my ageing pair of yellow Moroccan slippers which I bought in the early 1990's. Also present were RU Seerius, Lady Helen’bak, Lord and Lady Tourettes (aka Sir Tax-a-Lot), Lady Table Manners, The Fragrant Mary, and an assortment of ne’er do wells and misfits from the southern constituency.\nThere was a somber atmosphere at the count as Labour senior management were adjusting to the loss of many of their heartlands. The Loony’s briefly cheered up Emily Thornberry when she noticed Lord Sandy’s heels and burst into laughter. A final spoiled ballot paper which which Lord Sandy's team saw was rude, it described the candidates as ‘all shite’! The Acting Returning Officer and her staff maintained clear heads and a professional demeanor throughout, while the Loony’s revelled in a thoroughly good night\n27th Sep 2019 Loony Conference at George & Dragon, Belper\nA repeat performance! The Loony Party isn't huge, but the dedicated travel from all parts of the United Kingdom. Belper is central of course, but also a welcoming town so was a popular choice for a second go. Gripper & the Gurnards played again on the Friday night. I missed some of the events on the Saturday, as I took my son Pi to football at Cavendish Fields in Matlock. But I was there for the awesome record breaking ‘Eye of the Tiger’ on Kazoo which was organised by Barmy Lord Brockman. There was anticipation as the massed crowd of enthusiatic musicians gave a deep breath, paused, then gave it their all . . . an emotional and heart-rendering experience to be a part of!\nThe discussion of politics is usually frowned on at Loony Party gatherings but there was much talk of a possible and looming general election. There was a cheer at Howling Laud's speech when he told us to 'prepare for government'.\n1st Aug 2019 Counting Agent for Lady Lily the Pink at Brecon and Radnorshire By-election\nLady Lily the Pink has been a dominant player in the Loony Party for some years. She has stood a few times and was extremely helpful and pivotal in our Party Election broadcast for our Welsh Assembly campaign of 2016. So it was a no-brainer when the by-election was called for Brecon & Radnorshire, it just had to be Pink. Lily, as always, ran an exuberant operation, with a great team.\nI hitched a lift to Powys with RU & HelenBak and we arrived to truly lovely digs at The Cedars, Hay Road in Builth Wells.\nShortly after meeting Mark Reckless I sneaked out of our 'Victory Party' in the Barley Mow Hotel for a delicious curry at the Ginger Leaf Indian Restaurant on the High Street and when I returned was just in time for a lift to the Royal Welsh Showground for the count.\nBoth Lily and Howling were totally on fire and the evening was ours culminating in a heady victory over UKIP at the declaration.\nLily and posse were displayed as the headline photo for a much later news piece by the BBC.\nThe Incredible Flying Brick & Mark Reckless\n6th June 2019 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at Peterborough By-election.\nThe rain didn't stop and became increasingly heavy as I drove to Peterborough. I hoped it would lighten but it never did, so signatures were collected in very wet doorways on the 8th May. I had to jump from street to street as each sheet I was using from the electoral roll disintegrated and became illegible. I was invited in to dry off by a very kind couple who gave me a tea and both signed my form while I admired their collection of Elvis memoribilia. Later retiring in a soggy state once more to my car I set my satnav to a postcode in Dogsthorpe, where I quickly collected the remainder of Howling's nominations from some very friendly people. My hat was soaked by a wet but successful day.\nRU, Helen and I had an excellent curry at the 'Bombay Brasserie' on the night of the count.\nI have increasingly come to the opinion that postal voting is difficult to adjudicate. There appear to be questions over the result in Peterborough. I believe that democracy is safest kept 'physical' and as 'real' as possible. By this I mean that voters, as much as possible, should present themselves in person at the polling booth.\n15th Feb 2019 >>Statement of Accounts for 2018<< to the Electoral Commission\n29th Dec 2018 - Brexit\nThe UK joined a 'Common Market' in 1975; it is now a 'European Union' and is inevitably to become a 'European Federation' with an end to national banks and independent autonomy. The European Union has a 'direction of travel' and will inevitably become, and impose on the regions within it, a version of government which is very different than our parliamentary democracy. It is important that the UK regains and retains independence from all the dystopic superstates. Our country should navigate a gentle course among our Commonwealth relatives and wider friends in the international community. I do not like flag waving and am uncomfortable with nationalism, but the UK Parliament is functional and protects its citizens. We in turn should take care and maintain our democracy, as it will stand us well in the future.\n28th Sep 2018 Loony Conference at George & Dragon, Belper\nBrick, Nick Davis, Horse (hidden) Gripper\nMy old friend Lieutenant Jâger Schnitzel of the band BBBlackdog has long enjoyed running festivals. So he teamed up with Craig, landlord of The George & Dragon in Belper, to host our annual conference. Gripper & the Gurnards' headlined on the Friday night, which was great fun.\n14 June 2018 Counting Agent for Howling Laud at Lewisham East By-election\nChinners stepped up to the mark and valiently sorted Howling's nominations. Originally he had no luck, but the punters in the Catford Constitutional Club embraced our cause so that is where we had our victory party, after which it was a few steps to the Lewisham Civic Suite where the count was held.\nWe did well to arrive at the Count shortly after midnight, and not any later, as it was all over by 1am!\nRU Seerius, Chinners, Hell 'n Bak, Knigel Knapp, Jon Craig, Badger\n2nd May 2018 Resigned from Kirk Ireton Parish Council\nI had been a nominated Loony Party Parish Councillor since 8th Apr 2011 and felt seven years was enough. I had the highest attendence record for a number of those years, had made two successful lottery bids for play equipment and started the Kirk Ireton Neighbourhood Plan, which I continue as chair. However I have always regarded myself more cut out to be a national politician!\n21st Feb 2018 >>Statement of Accounts for 2017<< to the Electoral Commission\n8th Jun 2017 Counting Agent for Knigel Knapp at Islington North\nTheresa May let me down by calling the general election so soon after I had stood in the Stoke by-election. My wife Lizzie had taken our two children Xanthe & Pi on holiday to Teneriff and the general election was called while they were away. Just before they had left I had foolishly chuntered about my finances. Lizzie is not a 'news' person and I asked her, a few days after they had returned, if she knew \"there was a general election on\" and she didn't which made for a little tension. In a spirit of family harmony it seemed best to forego another new personal parliamentary campaign and focus my efforts on wider party ambition.\nRU, Hell 'n Bak and I turned the screws on Knigel Knapp, 'Knight of the unKnown' with offers of support. This clinched it and he acquiesced. So plans were made for an expedition to Islington North.\nNick the Flying Brick, The Comedy Terrorist, RU Seerius, Knigel Knapp, Michael Fibber &Hell 'n Bak\nThe Big Fibbers gave a great performance at 'The Liquor Works' on Holloway Road and I enjoyed meeting the The comedy terrorist, we patched up our differences from the 2003 by-election count at Brent East. I had a very nice North African meal at a small restaurant a few doors down from the gig. After the gig we had a short walk to the Sobell Leisure centre and the world of Corbynista.\nJeremy Corbyn seemed very affable and didn't baulk at shaking my hand when he arrived with his entourage. in contrast to many candidates at counts I've been to over the years his security was easily overwhelmed by our rabble of Loonys. He was surrounded by very gentle souls which I was surprised by and is enamouring. That didn't stop me in my mission for a photo-bombing opportunity which probably doesn't say much for my own character!\nAfter the count was declared Knigel and I cornered Michael Crick\n23rd Feb 2017 Candidate in the Stoke-on-Trent\nCentral By-election\nStoke-on-Trent was my tenth attempt on Parliament,\nand fourth by-election. I have taken a leaf out\nof the Iconic Arty Pole's book and it is the first\ntime I have stood with an adjective having previously\nbeen described by nouns.\nCollecting the nominations was bitterly cold,\nbut an easy task as Stokies are the friendliest\npeople on the planet. I do genuinely believe that\nHanley would be the perfect place to rehouse Parliament.\nNot only is it perfectly positioned geographically\nbut the the warmth of the locals might just have\na profound effect on the workings of government.\nImagine what a fine building the country could\nbuild in Hanley with a fraction of the money required\nto renovate the Palace of Westminster. In my perfect\nworld Parliament would be housed in Hanley and\nthe Welsh assembly would be moved to Stoke with\nthe Scottish Parliament housed in Tunstall. This\nwould require the ownership of the respective\ntowns to be turned over to their respective nations,\nthereby ensuring the governing bodies autonomy.\nIt may be possible to cede Longton to Northern\nIsland and Fenton to the Irish Republic, but I\nmay be just getting ridiculous.\nMy interview with Emma Thomas outside BBC Radio\nStoke was aired on Sunday Politics with my policy\nof 'putting Piranhas in the River Trent\nto make fishing a spectator sport' turning out\nto be very popular with the newspapers. A later\ndeclaration in my campaign that I am 'the only\ntrue fakir of fake news, almost but not quite,\na facetious factory of fakiry,' was considerably\nless popular and hardly mentioned at all.\nRU Seerius, Leutenant Jâger Schnitzel,\nSir Tax-A-Lot, The Inflatable Johnny Disco, The Incredible\nFlying Brick, Hell n' Bak, Howling laud, Karen, Lady\nTable Manners, The Indestructible Captain Chaplington-Smythe\nA magnificent troupe of Loonies met at The\nTerrace, City Road, Fenton. I was joined\nthe Illustrious Howling Laud, RU Seerius, Helen\nBak, Leutenant Jâger Schnitzel, Karen,\nSir Tax-A-Lot, & Lady Table Manners. The Inflatable\nJohnny Disco and the Indestructible Captain Chaplington-Smythe\nlent support and guidance at the pub but returned\nto Manchester before the count.\nThe count was a big event and had a great atmosphere,\nPaul Nuttall made a bee-line for our party leader\nand gave him a big hug, I believed that this was\nin anticipation of a Loony victory. We mingled\nseamlessly with the other parties and candidates\nincluding Barbara Fielding, who has the aura of\na lovely sweet lady which is the antithesis of\nher message. It was a pleasure to meet the Liberal\ncandidate Dr Zulfiqar Ali, a real gentleman and\nheart surgeon.\nThere was an exciting scrum at the end of the\nnight when the election was declared. In a strange\nbreak with tradition the candidates werent\ninvited to join the returning officer on stage.\nInstead we were swallowed up in a frenzied media\ncircus around Paul Nuttall and the winner Gareth\nSnell who gave me a man-hug in the excitement!\nHe then fought his way through teaming tangle\nof reporters to give a some-what drowned out speech.\nI once again came seventh, in a field of ten and\ncame ahead of the BNP\n8th Feb 2017 >>Statement of Accounts for 2016<< to the Electoral Commission\n8th Dec 2016 Election Agent for The Iconic\nArty-Pole at the Sleaford and North Hykeham By-election.\nUsually when two by-elections\noccur around the same time, they occur on a a mutually agreed date.\nThis wasn't the case with Richmond and Sleaford\nas polling days were one week apart, allowing\nHowling and I to attend both.\nThe Iconic Arty-Pole, High Sherrif of Lincolnshire Mrs Jill\nHughes, Howling Laud\nIt took me a couple of hours to reach Sleaford\nincluding the half hour to change a tyre in the\n'Derbyshire Hotel' car park just off Junction\n28 in Pinxton. Lincolnshire is a large but with\npoor roads, so Arty also took the same time to\ntravel across the county and we met up shortly\nafter 10am on the 10th of November. Arty was sprited\nin his collection of nominations and it didn't\ntake long to collect them from houses around Castle\nTerrace. We were even invited in by Pearl for\na warming cup of tea. I don't know what it is\nabout the Council Elections Departments but they\nare always populated by extremely elegant people,\nand Sleaford is no exeption. Marcella who took\nour papers was the most civilised lady you could\never meet, I hope our Elections Departments always\nremain this way.\n1st Dec 2016 Counting Agent for Howling\nLaud at the Richmond Park By-election\nThe last time an MP stood down with the plan\nof restanding again was in Haltemprice and Howden,\nand that, with twenty six candidates, was for\nme, the craziest by-election yet . . . Richmond\nPark didn't have the same number of candidates,\nbut it was still wonderfully bonkers. There were\nplenty of harbinger's in the press so Chinners\nwas on the case immediately Zac announced his\nresignation. Chinners, Howling's Election Agent,\nreally threw himself at the campaign and what's\nmore arranged a victory party at the 'The Triple\nCrown' with Loony legends 'What's Next' carrying\nus into the evening. This was a nostalgic taste\nfrom years of yore with a traditional loony menu\nfusing 'rock 'n roll' and politics into a full\nnights' entertainment.\nI snuck out on my own for\nan hour to eat a fabulous curry at the Cafe Masala.\nI had my usual three vegetarian side dishes with\nrice and pickles.\nThere were a lot of big name political journalists\nat the count including Jon Craig who was rude\nwhen I offered him my camera asking if he could\ntake a photo of us, I guess he was busy. Zac was\nclearly shocked by his result, although his attractive\nentourage were more sanguine. He is a big celebrity,\nmaybe his team will have more space for a better\nproject, I imagine parliament was quite claustraphobic\nfor those around him.\nYvonne Elwood, Flying Brick, Obe'Joyful,\nHowling Laud, Laud Lawson, Knigel Knapp, Chinners\n20th Oct 2016 Counting Agent for The\nMad Hatter at the Witney By-election\nIt was great to finally meet the charming Mad\nHatter after our many phone conversations. The\nHatter runs themed tours in and around Oxford\nand is also an active campaigner on political\nissues, this distinguishes him from lightweights\nlike me. He is Scottish, and travelled home to\ncampaign for Scotland to leave during the Independence\nReferendum of 2014 and more recently campaigned\nfor the UK to remain part of the European Union.\nThis means he is embraced by the party, not necessarily\non his positions, but for being on the losing\nside!\nI stayed at a guest house on Iffley Road in Oxford,\nwhich was the worst place I've ever stayed at\nin this country, and was the Hatter and Chinners'\ntaxi to Witney. We all enjoyed the count at the\nWindrush Leisure Centre, the 'One Love' Party\ndeserve better results they're young and cool.\nHell 'n Bak, Chinners, Flying Brick,\nMad Hatter, RU Seerius, Howling, Tom Gullandt-Milner\n23th June 2016 Voted 'Leave' in the EU\nReferendum\nI voted to leave the European Union in the referendum.\nNot enough people vote in the EU elections and no ordinary\nvoter understands how the EU works. 'The project' appears\nto be increasingly burdened with an over-bureaucratic\nand dictatorial executive. There are positive aspects\nto the EU, for instance, the block has stood up to the\nlarge, predatory US companies. But the EU is enslaving\nthe southern countries to poverty and dictating unreasonable\nterms to them. I do not believe the UK would ever have\nbeen able to 'change the EU from the inside' and the\ndirection of travel is wrong. I believe the best way\nforward is to make a complete break with the EU and\nI hope the UK can renew our traditional ties with Australia,\nNew Zealand and Canada. However I support the court\ncase by Gina Miller and ensuing legal proceedings. I\nbelieve it is very important that the good ship 'Brexit'\nis kept trim and true with hatches battened down, but\nwe shouldn't throw our courts overboard as we sail through\nthese choppy seas.\n16th June 2016 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at the Tooting By-election\nI set off to London at 3.45am hoping to have\nan comfortable run of it, with breakfast on the\nway, but there were nose to tail lorries on the\nM1, even at that time, and it wasn't an easy drive.\nMy SatNav later took me through parts of Kensington\nwhich was lovely. The elections department was\nat Wandsworth Council and when I arrived at 8.30\nin the morning I stood in full loony regalia with\nan assortment of people outside what turned out\nto be the wrong part of the civic buildings. Once\ninside the moth eaten benefits offices I was directed\nup the road to the splendid marble bedecked Town\nHall, so it was a morning of contrasts.\nHelen Lucas, a party supporter, proposed Howling\non the nomination form and then we walked around\nroads in Tooting knocking on doors looking for\na further nine signatures.\nI arrived at Helen's house just in time to help carry\na new mattress upstairs into her flat and later delivered\nher old one to the Council Tip in Wandsworth. I just\nsqueezed the mattress into my Hyundai Santa Fe and took\nit on the way back to delivering the nominations. I\nlove visiting tips, and the Wandsworth one was a great\nexperience, it has the design of a multi-storey car\npark, completely unlike the spacious ones we have in\nDerbyshire.\nUnfortunately I didn't see the 'G' in the electoral\nregister next to some of the people who signed the nomination\npaper. This symbol was for European citizens who are\nineligable to vote in Parliamentary Elections so I had\nto return to Tooting later in the afternnoon and find\nthree more assenters. It was early evening by the time\nHowling's papers were accepted, so it had been a long\nday by the time I had driven back home.\nWe had a few drinks in the Spread Eagle opposite the\nTown Hall on the night of the election and rolled into\nthe count in a very upbeat mood expecting to 'win this\none, no problem'. However, the mood at the count was\nvery somber, with the murder of Jo Cox overwhelmingly\nsetting the tone. The winning candidate Rosena Allin-Khan\nhad deep empathy with the events in Yorkshire and made\na very poignant speech. I guess there are vulnerabilities\nto public office which are difficult to get genuine\ninsight to when standing on a Loony ticket. On a lighter\nnote we particularly enjoyed the company of Rainbow\nGeorge and his candidate Smiley Smillie.\nLaud Lawson & Obe'Joyful, Smiley\nSmillie, Hell 'n Bak, Howling, RU Seerius, Yvonne Elwood,\nRainbow George\n28th May 2016 Front row seat at the 'Monster\nRaving Loony' play at Soho Theatre\nThis was a wonderful and bizarre thing, a play\nin London about Screaming Lord Sutch. Howling\nwas given some complimentary tickets for a Saturday\nmatinee so I took the train to London and met\nup the gang at The Nellie Dean having had a quick\ncurry at the Hare Krishna's.\nIt was an engaging event as Sutchy runs, slumps\nand jumps through classic twentieth century television\nshows. There was an odd art house feel as old\nTV sets flicker historical events at us and then\neverything halts while we play bingo and participate\nwith pots and pans in a skiffle band. The performance\nwas over all too quickly and before we knew it\nwe had met the cast and were outside blinking\nin the sunlight.\nSteve & Joy Lawson, Vivienne Acheampong,\nJoe Allessi, Jack Brown, Howling, Tom Attwood, Nigel\nKnapp, Samuel James, Linda Landers, Gregory Clarke,\n?, Brick\n5th May 2016 Candidate & Election\nAgent for the North Wales Reion of the Welsh Assembly\nThe count of all the votes cast in the the North\nWales region was coordinated by Colin Everett\nwho is Chief Returning Officer for Flintshire\nCounty Council. Lynn Phillips the Elections manager\nthought the results would be declared sometime\nbetween 4-6am so, realising it was going to be\na late one, I suggested to Johnny Disco and Sir\nOink-a-Lot that we meet at Cloleg Cambria Deeside,\nwhere the count was taking place, at 2 o'clock\nin the morning. On arrival it was easy to spot\nJohnny's van as it has \"The Vinyl Countdown\"\nwritten in bold letters across its side!\nThe count had a jolly and slightly provinsional\natmosphere. I had been a bit worried there might\nbe some hostlity towards us as in reality we were\nsix English candidates standing for North Wales,\nbut there was no need to worry, everyone was very\nfriendly.\nSir Oink-A-Lot & Johnny Disco\nSometime between 4-5am all the counting\ntellers finished their work and the two or three Constituency\n'Assembly Members' within Flintshire were directed up\nto the small stage and declared. There was a lull while\nthe tellers sat in front of empty tables and chatted,\nthen very smoothly they disappeared into the night. Then\nequally efficiently the tables vanished and most of the\ncounting agents and guests took their leave.\nAt about six in the morning the massive sports hall had\nfour lone tables pushed together in a square in the middle\nof it with Colin, Lynne and two or three other council\nstaff valiently propping each other up and round the corner\nin the other leg of the vast 'L' shaped space were a random\nassortment including three Loonys, some UKIP, Plaid Camru,\nand others totalling about fifteen in all. We were waiting\nfor the regional results from Anglesey. When Colin came\nover at 7.45 he cheerfully suggested that any candidates\nremaining were welcome to join him on the stage. Lynn\ntold me, as we made our goodbye's, that she had been awake\nfor over twenty six hours!\nA peculiarality of this event for me is that I requested,\nas usual, our 'Top Hat with Vote Loony Printed' emblem\nbut instead we had our 'Party Shield', which includes\nthe Union Jack on the ballot paper. I'm not really a big\nfan of flags so have always spurned this one. However,\npossibly as a result of this, North Wales Loonys got the\nhighest votes in all the five regions.\n13th Apr 2016 The Loony 'Party Election\nBroadcast' transmitted BBC1 Wales, BBC2 Wales & ITV\nWales\nThe golden rule of Monster Raving Loony Party\npolitics is to always have 'low expectations'.\nSo it was with a considerable amount of surprise\nthat I was told by Martin Forward at the BBC and\nNick Powell of ITV Wales that our PEB had passed\nall the criteria and would be broadcast on the\n13th April!\nList of persons nominated from the respective\nRegional Returning Officers\n2016_South_Wales_West_Persons_Nominated.pdf\n2016_South_Wales_Central_Persons_Nominated.pdf\n2016_South_East_Wales_Persons_Nominated.pdf\n2016_Mid_&_West_Wales_Persons_Nominated.pdf\n2016_North_Wales_Persons_Nominated.pdf\n22nd Feb 2016 >>Statement of Accounts for 2015<< to the Electoral Commission\n13th Feb 2016 Filming at The Senedd in\nCardiff\nAfter Llanwrtyd Wells we all decided that our\nfinal round of filming had to be shot in Cardiff\nat the Senedd. I rang the Welsh Assembly and spoke\nto Terry Matthews who was extremely helpful. We\nwere all grateful to be inside on the day and\nnot in the cold and drizzle. The staff were friendly\nand fortunately there were few other visitors\nso we were able to make a little more commotion\nthan would normally be acceptable. Later a few\nof us walked into the harbour where there was\na great atmosphere as the Six Nations had chosen\nthe same day to stage the rugby match between\nWales & Scotland!

The photo above\nwas taken in 'Caffi Sosban' where we filmed our\n'bog snorkelling' policy and our young voter.

I met our candidate\nSir Oink-A-Lot in the car park outside the Civic\nCentre, Oldham on the 6th November. He collected\nall but two of the signitures by door knocking\nin cold relentless drizzle on Chadderton Park\nRoad. He's obviously far friendlier looking as\nit took me as long to get the last two as it took\nhim to collect the first eight!\nAn excellent night although we were lucky\nthat the pub closed so early as the count finished and\nthe election was declared at 1.30am, we could have missed\nit!\nDale Rowles, Karen Van\nWoerden, Tony & Julie Stacey, Marc 'Hands' Jones,\nHell 'n Bak, Sir Oink, Johnny Disco, Chinners, Howling,\nPaul Nuttall\n15th Oct 2015 - Liaising with the BBC\n& Electoral Commission\nLaurence, my contact at the BBC, kindly\nfound the contact details for Tabby Karamat in 'Politics\nEditorial Policy', who in turn directed me to Martin Forward\n'Planning Manager' for BBC Wales.\nI spoke to Robert Coombs 'Senior Political Parties Liaison\nOfficer' for the The Electoral Commission in Wales who\nwas very helpful and confirmed everything Mark Beech had\nadvised about eligibility for a Party Election Broadcast.\nThe authorities were informed of our intent!\n25th Sep 2015 Loony Conference at Uncle Tom's Cabin,\nBlackpool\nWhen Howling declared we were to have our conference\nat Blackpool RU & I decided he must have gone\nmad. But it was the best one ever! Uncle Tom's\nCabin was the perfect venue and our man in Blackpool\nTony Davis hired a bus and drove us round a Wetherspoons\npub crawl on the Saturday afternoon. A lot of\nus stayed at Simon & Rhona's 'New Guilderoy\nHotel' who were not only very hospitable but also\njoined in the tour and cabinet reshuffle.\nLady Lily the Pink and Anna-Lisa encouraged their\nfriend Craig Tompkins to drive them up to the\nconference with his movie camera. We shot our\nfirst footage for our 'Party Election Broadcast'\nin front of a large backdrop of a library in the\nfront room of the hotel. A few weeks later Craig\nsent the footage taken at the 'New Guildroy Hotel'\nat our Blackpool Conference to Gordon Vowles,\na party supporter and editing maestro based in\nLondon. Gordon composed a draft edit of a PEB\nwith a quirky angle that everyone thought was\ngreat so it was all steam ahead.\nTony Davis\nWe hatch a plan to qualify for a 'Party Election\nBroadcast' in the Welsh Assembly Elections\nThe Loony Party have long aspired to qualify for the\n'holy grail' of a 'Party Election Broadcast'. There is\nalways a lot of talk at Monster Raving Loony Party conferences,\noften over a few pints, and the idea of achieving a PEB\nis one of the many pipe dreams that we have loved to speculate\nabout. Fortunately we have among our number Mark Beech\nwho grasped the mettle and did a bit of research. Mark\nproposed the idea of submitting enough candidates to the\nWelsh Assembly to qualify the Loonys for a Party 'Election\nBroadcast' in Wales. He had stood in the Welsh Assembly\nElections as a regional candidate, with his friend Pinkandorevil\nGem in 2011 and spent a little time finding out how many\nwe needed to stand, and where, and how much it would cost.\nThere are sixty seats in the Welsh Assembly. Forty are\nconstituency seats elected in the same way as the UK parliament.\nThe other twenty 'regional seats' are made up of four\nseats in each of the five regions. A £500 deposit\nis required to stand up to 12 candidates in each region\n(although only four can be elected). As long as we stood\nfour or more candidates within all five regions we would\nqualify for a Party Election Broadcast. We are comparitively\nstrong in Wales, and Mark and I decided to give it our\nbest shot. Lady Lily the Pink, Baron Von Claptrap and\nAlun Magpie Bum agreed to be Election Agents for Mid Wales,\nSouth West Wales and South East Wales, Mark chose to organise\nSouth wales Central, his previous patch, and I opted for\nNorth Wales.\n7th May 2015 Candidate at Doncaster North in the General Election\nThis was my fifth General Election, but the first\naway from Derbyshire Dales. I felt it was time\nfor me to stand against a 'big gun'. My choice\nlocally was Nick Clegg in Sheffield or Ed Milliband\nin Doncaster. I chose Milliband as I thought,\nincorrectly as it turned out, that every man and\nhis dog would be standing against Nick Clegg.\nI drove up the M1 to Doncaster on the 2nd of April\nand collected all ten signitures entirely from\nFrank Road, DN59SY, within an hour. What a friendly\nstreet!\nI handed my nomination papers in to Keith Porter\nElectoral Services Manager, who is a very well\nspoken gentleman. He used to be the returning\nofficer in Margaret Thatcher's constituency Finchley\nand said he had met Lord Sutch several times.\nSusie Delves, Dr Doodle Do, Lady Tax-a-Lot,\nFlying Brick, RU Seerius, Hell 'n Bak, Lady Table Manners,\nLeon of Britain, Sir Tax-a-Lot\nThe night of the count was a marvellous occasion\nand I had an excellent group of supporters. We\nmade our customary loud entrance to the counting\nhall and this was covered by The Telegraph among\nothers.\nAt the end of the night at about 5.30am I was\nasked very politely if I wouldn't mind standing\nat the very end of the stage for the declaration,\nbut I forgot. Poor Ed Milliband's party were having\na rotten night and he looked quite glum, I on\nthe other night was extremely pleased with my\n162 votes and was feeling quite cheerful.\nNick\nthe Flying Brick Vows to save the country from Red Ed'\nin The Sun\nLoony\ncandidate arrives at Doncaster count on ITV 7th May\nVideo\nclip on ITV 7th May\nVideo\nClip on Telegraph 7th May\nDisappointment\nand joy in the British elections in (Dutch) NRC Handelsblad\n8th May\n2015's\nWeirdest Candidates: A Guide To 'The Also Rans' in Huffington\nPost\nLost_Election_Deposits_in\nThe_Mirror_20th_Jun_2015\n27th Apr 2015 >>Re-elected_Kirk_Ireton_Parish_Council<<\nApr 2015 I asked the BBC to display our colours in\ntheir political broadcasts\nIt's always a pleasure to see the party name\non BBC news, but this has always been slightly\nmarred by by being framed in greyness. The BBC\nhave always displayed our hopefuls in elections\nwith a grey tab among the other red, blue, orange,\npurple and green candidates. I rang the BBC about\nthis issue in early 2015 and spoke to Laurence\nCoss in 'Information & Archives' who raised\nmy query with 'News'. I received an email from\nthe BBC on the 15th April saying that \"The\nbasic point is that we have colours for parties\nthat have some record of winning elections or\nat least coming close to winning them. That can\nbe local, Mayoral, European, Scottish, Welsh,\nNorthern Irish or general elections.\"\nAfter a discussion with Howling I argued that\nwe have had a Town Mayor, and at present have\nDistrict Councillor and several Parish councillors\nand was rung by Peter Barnes on the 21st April\n2015 while I was 'Lester Lowes' my local agricultural\nand builder merchants in Derbyshire, where it's\nquite noisy. Peter said that it was impossible\nto change anything for the General Election but\nseemed to think it might be possible to introduce\ncolours for the smaller parties in by-elections.\nHe said the BBC take their lead from the 'Press\nAssociation'. I didn't get very far with the Press\nAssociation who just tried to tap me for a story!\n5th Feb 2015>>Statement of Accounts for 2014<< to the Electoral Commission\n9th Oct 2014 Election Agent for Howling Laud at the\nClacton By-election\nI will never trust my sat-nav again, as it took\nme right down the M1 and around the M25 to Clacton-on-Sea,\na truly appalling route. I set off at just after\n5am and arrived at the Town Hall at 10am. Fortunately,\nonce there, a quick trot round Alexandra and Meredith\nRoad, a stones throw from the Town Hall, got me\nthe ten nominations for Howling, and I was on\nthe way back home at 1pm.\nThe count was another classic night. I was filmed\nby Sky\nNews, with Howling, trying to convince Douglas\nCarswell to cross the floor to the Loony Party\nand later had my photo taken with Lembit\nÖpik and Norman\nSmith\n26th Sep 2014 Loony Conference at The Ridgebourne\nInn, Llandrindod Wells\nThis was the 30th Loony Party conference and\nthe first one held in Wales. The Ridgebourne Inn\nwas a warm, welcoming place and Llandrindod Wells\nis a regal town with a certain faded glamour,\na bit like the Loony Party really. Gripper and\nthe Gurnards had been renamed 'Buster and the\nGonads' and we played on Saturday night with Knigel\nKnapp, Dale and Molly singing for us, replacing\nNick who was taking his daughter to the zoo.

My nominations came\nfrom Hatton Gardens and Milner Street and I had\nmy first one, from Ian, within two minutes of\nparking my car.\nI had an interview\nwith Alan Clifford on Radio Nottingham on\nthe 27th May. On Monday the 2nd of June I was\ninterviewd by Chris Mason from the BBC and filmed\nby Channel 4 News in the Newark Town market place\nwhich was aired that night. I used my studio to record\nmy one minute election address and this was\naired on Radio Nottingham around the 3rd of June.\nThe election count was held in the fabulous Kelham\nHall and the acting returning officer Andrew Muter\nran a seamless event with a fantastic atmosphere\nand bar! At about 2am the atmosphere became electric\nwhen Nigel Farage made a rock stars entrance\nand Howling and I swiftly formed a strategy of\nambush. Our plan worked and the picture with story\nwas published in The\nMetro newspaper on the 6th June.\nI spent some time back pedaling when talking to\nPaul Baggaley; a highly successful local campaigner\nfor Newark Hospital. He latched onto my pledge,\nif elected, of becoming the Newark Town Football\nClub mascot.

Derrill\nCarr, a micro brewery representative, was sucked\ninto the inner Loony party machinery in June 2013.\nAlan and Derrill hatched a plan to rebrand the finest\nlocal beers in Hampshire under a Loony Party 'Co-ALE-ition'\nbrand. Derrill is a man of boundless energy and\nbusiness acumen and the Loony Party have been transformed\novernight from a one cylinder putt putt engine to\na V8.\nThe first four of the Co-ALE-ition beers had the\n2010 Election photo of David Cameron raising Howling's\nvictorious hand as the pump-clip theme. For the\nfifth, Monster Mash, the Loony cabinet were included\nin the pump-clip and I was given the task of compiling\nthe image in Photoshop.\nKnigel Knapp, Baron Von Thunderclap,\nHowling Laud, Chinners, Flying Brick, RU Seerius\nOn the 1st of May Co-ALE-ition was launched\nat the Mash Brewery at Burcot Farm near East Stratton\nand we moved from there to the Fulflood Arms, where this\nphoto was taken, and then onto The Albion, both in Winchester.\nI travelled down with RU Seerius and Hell 'n Back and\nstayed at The King Alfred. What a great night, what great\nbeer.\n23rd Feb 2014 Toby Jug's expulsion from\nthe Party\nThe Loony Party embraces theatrical displays\nof aggrandisement, it is all part of the fun. But while\nToby Jug is adept at playing the media he unfortunately\nsuffers from self-importance and is delusional. In the\nyears up to 2014 he took to declaring himself to be the\nobvious leader of the party while at the same time vitriolically\nand aggresively attacking Howling and the rest of us.\nHe has a habit of upsetting people. I've always thought\nthat the Loony Party has echoes of an amateur dramatic\ngroup. Toby is like the over-enthusiastic ham actor with\nno insight into the feelings of everyone else in the group\nor sense of irony. We eventually became fed up, all mutually\nagreed, and formerly expelled him.\n13th Feb 2014 Election Agent for Captain Chaplington-Smythe at Wythenshawe & Sale East By-election.\nI got off to a bit of\nan embarrassing start when I rang the Manchester\nElectoral Office asking for the date of the by-election\nonly a few hours after Paul Goggins had died. This\nwasn't intentionally callous; since the loss of\nMad Cow Girl and Johnny Cartwright there is no-one\nin the Loony Party who is keenly watching out for\nby-elections and they are easily missed. When I\nreceived a text from Howling in Malta, on the 7th\nof January, telling me about a by-election in Wythenshawe\nI naturally assumed I was late and rang the elections\noffice in a panic!\nAndy Cameron, Howling Laud, Flying\nBrick, Emma Chapman, Captain Chaplington-Smythe, Johnny\nDisco\nIt was the same team in the Town Hall\nwho ran the Manchester Central by-election in November\n2012, so I was pleased to have easy access to them as\nthe Labour Party didn't dawdle in issuing the writ.\nWhen the writ was issued on the 21st of January for\nnominations in by the 28th it was immediately clear\nthat Howling would be unable to stand as he didn't get\nback from holiday in Malta until the 30th!\nAndy Cameron and John 'Horatio' Horner had been Counting\nAgents at the Manchester Central by-election a year\nbefore, and they suggested Captain Chaplington-Smythe\nas the Loony candidate with their local pub The Crown\nInn as the headquarters for the campaign. On the 28th\nJanuary I dropped the kids off to nursery, drove up\nand met Andy, we collected the register of electors\nfrom the Town Hall, and went on to the The Crown. Andy\nhad been amazingly organised and a stream of nominators\nflowed through the door and we had all our signatures,\nand a couple of spare, by midday.\nThe Count was held in a very comfortable side room at\nthe GMex Centre and was a very civilised and pleasant\naffair. The Labour candidate Mike\nKane looked tired but was friendly and enjoyed a\njoke with The Captain. The Captain was carrying a small\nplastic Darth Vader which made occasional profound utterances\nsuch as \"Your lack of faith disturbs me,\"\nwhich went down well with the journalists.\nAt the end of the night Howling and I went back to the\nBritannia Hotel, and shared a can of lager with the\nUKIP leadership, who were a lot more livelier at 3.30am\nthan me, what stamina!\n4th Mar 2014 >>Statement of Accounts for 2013<< to the Electoral Commission\n27th Sep 2013 Loony Conference at The Pavilion, Matlock\nBath\nMy old friend Dale Rowles transformed The Pavillion\nfor the Steampunk and Loony 'Illuminati' There\nwas speculation that many of the steampunk enthuisiasts\nwould embrace Loony but in the event it was the\nLoonys who went steampunk. I now have a lovely\npair of yellow and black goggles adorning my top\nhat. Gripper & the Gurnards headlined on the\nFriday night which was fun, and I think we played\nwell. I had to fix the wardrobe I borrowed from\nthe Fleet Arts Centre as we had a cabinet collapse\nduring the reshuffle on Saturday afternoon. It\nwas soon after the Cabinet Reshuffle that Dave\nSavage appeared at The Fishpond. He attended Howlings\nspeech on a spacehopper and then disappeared again\nas if transported by inter-dimensional portal.\nAt the same time Charin from Bradford briefly\nmaterialised, it was great to see him, that was\nmy favourite by-election of all time.\nChinners, Howling, Mary, Sir Nos Da,\nDave Savage, Knigel Knapp, Lord Offa, Chris, Tony Davis\n2nd May 2013 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at South Shields By-election\nThis was one of my finer efforts\nat securing Howling a by-election.\nI needn't have worried about by old\nJeep Cherokee making the trip as I\nset off at half five in the morning,\nit ate the motorway up. I arrived\nat South Shields Town Hall at just\nafter nine on the 17th of April and\nwas collecting signatures by door\nknocking at ten. The Lonnen was freezing\ncold and enormous seagulls swooped\naround my top hat. It took longer\nthan expected to collect the ten signatures\nas many of the dwellings were furnished\nbut uninhabited. A sprightly ninety-year-old\nex-miner told me that a lot of them\nwere second homes 'for the benefits'.\nI can't help wondering how many Lonnen's\nare up and down the country. The senior\nelections officer Joanne Gelson was\nvery helpful when I returned to the\nTown Hall and I was out and back off\ndown the road by one o'clock and back\nto Derbyshire by 4pm.\nI hitched a lift with RU, Helen and\nGuinness, their dog, for the election\nnight,a far more relaxing way to\ntravel. During the election run-up\nthe Guardian had published a critical\nand unfair letter about UKIP written\nby Toby Jug. I've always enjoyed UKIP's\ncompany at by-elections and felt sad\nabout the frustration UKIP felt towards\nus about it. Apart from this the night\nwas great fun, and exciting too, as\nwe all thought we might beat the Liberals,\nwhat delusions!\nToby Jug, Hel 'n bak, Flying\nBrick, Howlin Laud, RU Seerius, Cardinal\nMax at the Temple Park Leisure Centre\n22nd Mar 2013 >>Statement of Accounts for 2012<< to the Electoral Commission\n28th Feb 2013 Counting Agent for Howling Laud at Eastleigh By-election\nEastleigh is an easy train ride from\nDerby and the Wagon Works, our headquarters,\nwas right opposite the railway station.\nThere was a very diverse crowd of\npolitical campaigners in the pub including\na researcher for Elizabeth Truss.\nIt was a big night with a lot of media\ninterest, we hung out with UKIP, the\nWessex Regionalists, Christian and\nPeace parties. At the end of the night\nall the candidates were given the\nchance for a speech by the Returning\nOfficer and Howling sang 'Mack the\nKnife'.\nI think we were all a bit surprised\nto be beaten by the 'Beer, Fags &\nCrumpets' Party but I guess that's\nthe rough and tumble of politics.\nFlying Brick (wearing new\nhat), David, Kirsten, Sue Sneden, Damon\nHeritage, Alan Sneden, Howlin Laud, Toby\nJug, Debby\n15th Nov 2012 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at Manchester Central By-election\nI had a sinking feeling looking through\nthe electoral register at 11am on the 30th\nof October. I was sitting in The Smithfield\nHotel with Peter Hinchliffe, a journalist\nand blogger from Rochdale. I couldn't make\nsense of the register for the surrounding\narea or even find any local roads. I truly\nbelieved, for the first time, that I would\nnot be able to find the nominations before\nmy appointment at the Council Offices at 3:00pm\nlater that day.\nOver the years I have learnt that older folk\nare far more willing to nominate a loony so\nI asked Peter to 'take me to the pensioners'.\nHe drove me to Romney Street in Moston where\nI collected all the signitures, in drizzle,\nby knocking on doors in about twenty minutes,\na record for me I think!\nAgainst our expectations the count in the\nG-Mex Centre was a subdued and dismal occasion\nand I left and lost my hat in a taxi when\nwe returned to The Smithfield in the early\nhours of the morning.\n29th Sep 2012 Loony Conference\nat The White Hart Hotel, Uttoxeter\nWe were invited to run our conference\nat The White Hart in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire\nby Jade and her partner who had moved\nthere after managing our previous\nvenue The Links Hotel, Fleet, Hampshire.\nIn between inviting us and our conference\nin September, however, they were moved\nto manage another hotel back in the\nhome counties so we never saw them!\nOn the Friday night I was on bass\nwith Horse on drums, Gripper on guitar\nand Nick Davis singing in our band Gripper\nand the Gurnards.

Charin contacted\nHowling before the by-election and\nI met him at The New Inn on the 13th\nMarch immediately after picking up\nthe nomination papers from the Town\nHall.\nCharin is an amazing guy and opted\nto drive me around Bradford to various\nfriends' houses and places of work\nto collect signatures.

In early 2010, after many years\nof inactivity, Hot Pot Theatre restarted\nthe synchronised supermarket shopping\ntrolley routine with the intention\nof applying to Britain's Got Talent.\nDuring the summer we waltzed through 'Moon\nRiver' at Belper music festival (see photo)\nand at Maggie Braley's birthday party at the\nrugby club. Maggie is the visionary of the\ngroup and had conceived the trolley dance\nin 1999 when we performed caberet and pantomimes\nat the Fleet Arts centre.\nI recorded then sent them the Moon River showreel and a promotional\nflyer compiled by Maggie, with the application,\nto the TV show in November. Adam O'Neill phoned\nfrom BGT to say we had by-passed the initial\nround and were selected to go on stage in\nManchester.\nWe were asked to arrive at the Museum of Science\nand Industry, in Manchester, at 9:00am. I\nstayed close by at the Hôtel Campanile\nhaving driven there at 4am from the election\nin Oldham. I was in black tie as I walked\nto the Museum, which was quite different from\nthe loony attire I had been wearing a few\nhours earlier. The trolleys had been safely\ndelivered in Nick's van and we all met and\nwere all ready for action. We then waited\nfor hours in a holding area, in an upper floor\nof the Museum, which was not dissimilar to\nan bucket-jet airport lounge while a dog and\nSailor Pig attracted most of the BGT show\ncameras. It was an interesting place, with\na curious mix of people, most were young some\nwere old, a lot had delusional hopes of success\nand then there were a few who were just there\nfor a laugh. There were quite a number who\nwere obviously BGT cannon fodder, purely invited\nto be publicaly humiliated. When as a group\nwe started to see them we began to worry about\nwhich catagory we fell into.\nAt about 3pm we were whisked by minibus\nto the Opera House and were led through\na labyrinth of stairs and corridors\ndeep into its bowels and directly\nunder the stage. This was a disturbing\nplace as the cacophonic 'No' buzzers\nand deafening baying of the crowd\nleft no illusion to the bear pit we\nwere about to enter.\nOur turn was chaotic, we had to follow\nthe rules and walk on stage to present\nour act. We had chosen Haydee and\nshe spoke eloquently to the judges.\nAfter we had walked off stage it\ntook us time to help the ladies into\nthe trolleys. We were only ready to\nperform after Ant and Dec had helped\nus lift the trolleys over some large\nelectrical cables. It probably took\nsixty seconds, which was too long\nfor the the crowded Manchester Opera\nHouse, so we rolled onto the stage\nto the thunderous sound of an angry\naudience stamping its feet.\nOur syncronised dance to 'Moon River'\nby Henry Mancini is a slow and ethereal\nwaltz and the BGT friday afternoon\naudience were truculent and feisty.\nThe foot stomping that started as\nwe were preparing behind the curtains\nswiftly became a brutal chant of \"OFF\nOFF OFF\" as soon as we were on\nstage. Michael Mcintyre buzzed us\na big red X however Amanda Holden and David Hasselhoff\nlet us perform our piece and after\nwe had finished had clearly enjoyed\nour act. In the broadcasted \"producer's\ncut\" the audience's foot stomping\nand baying were removed and replaced\nwith warm enthusiastic applause!\nI had spoken about my Britain's\nGot Talent entry in the interview with Tony\nLivesey on Radio 5 Live the previous night\nat the by-election in Oldham. The Sun printed >>this\narticle<< in Colin Robertson's TV\nBiz on the following day Saturday 15th January.\nWe were voted through to the next round so\nwe received an A4 sheet >>BGT\nThe Next Stage<<. We were encouraged\nthrough sporadic phone calls to prepare another\n'audition piece' and led to believe we were\nlikely to perform it in front of the judges\nin London. Unfortunately our act hit the editing\nroom floor and we were never given the opportunity\nto perform Space.\nThe Sun published a new\nstory when we were dropped which\nwas funny although disheartening for the rest\nof the group. I was somewhat 'pimped-up' by\nthe Sun.\nLizzie's version of the events!\nWe had skirted the tedious first round,\nattended by more mundane and less organised\nacts, by sending in a DVD of Moon River\n- now also placed on\nYou Tube for our growing fan base's\npleasure. As such we were escalated to the\ndizzy heights of performing in the Manchester\nOpera House, in front of a live, and somewhat\nfiesty audience as well as the 3 judges\nin January. We arrived eager and champing\nat the shoppng trolley bit, but were forced\nlike the seemingly hundreds of other acts\nto wait around for most of the day doing;\nvery little. Whilst \"Penny the magic\ncard trick performing dog\", \"Sailor\nPig\" and various Middle Aged clog dancing\n\"performers\" seemed to attract\nmost of the pre-performance interview time\nand limelight! Our time eventually came\nhowever and despite some shockingly misleading\nand again shambolic stage management and\ndirection, performed Moon River for the\nfirst time, on stage, to the nation. During\nthis majestic and ethereal revelation, the\nless discerning members of the audience\n(from now on to be referred to as the \"baying\nmob\") seemed to tire and even disapprove\nof our talents and, the least discerning\nof the judges \"MM\"- apparently\na well known and even amusing comedian-\neven had the nerve to \"buzz\" us\na no!!! Undaunted however and as majestic\nas ever we continued and finished the performance\nwith an artistic flourish, lacking in most,\nwell all of the other acts.\nThe two remaining judges, clearly of a far\ngreater calibre and talent recognising ability\nwere then to judge us. The lovely Amanda\nHolden said despite SOME of the crowd's\nreaction she had thoroughly enjoyed our\nact and gave us an unequivocal YES!!! Then\nthe legendary David Haselhoff (better known\nto those of my generation as Michael Knight)\nhad the casting vote. There was some delay\nin his answer and remarks to the tone of\n\"Oh my God this is truly why I came\nto England\", but after a few winks\nfrom the bathing suited beauties, of course,\nhow could he have given us anything other\nthan; a YES!!!! And so; we thought, according\nto the so called \"rules\" we were\nTHROUGH to the next round. >>Certificate\nwe received<<\nWe then rethought and restruitured our\nsecond and entirely different, quicker paced,\nmore vibrant, more fantastical and altogether\nmore spacey routine, again thanks largely\nto the genius of Maggie. The rest of the\nstory is not a happy one. Despite being\nready for launch on various of the initial\ndates set for the next round in London,\nwhen it came to 3 days before the final\ndate in April we were contacted and told\nwe were out. As our fans can see, if not\non national TV in the coming weeks, but\non You tube and this website, the fact that\nwe were voted out from our Moon River performance\nis perhaps only second in tragic nature\nto our not being able to perform \"Space\"\nin front of the judges , again a live audience,\nthe nation, and ultimately the Queen. Luckily\nperhaps she, the Queen, can get some solace\nfrom a happily married off grandson in view\nof being deprived the most unusual, beautiful\nand imaginative performance at the Royal\nVariety show this summer, perhaps.\nStories published in The\nSun\nArticle\nin the Sun Britain's Dropped Talent\nArticle\nin The Sun 11 Apr 'Off your Trolleys'\nArticle\nin The Sun 15 Jan By-election Loony get's\nHoff's vote at BGT audition\nHistory of HotPot and trolley dancing\nWe started in 1999 as a community arts theatre\ngroup to continue the tradition of the Fleet\nArts annual panto. Nobody can remember if\nthere was a 'eureka' moment when someone\nin HotPot thought of 'synchronised supermarket\nshopping trolley dancing', or whether it\nwas collectively invented, but the visionary\nof our theatre group was Maggie Braley and\nthere is no doubt it is, and we are, a figment\nof Maggie's imagination. The trolley dances\nwere first performed in a night of Cabaret\nat Fleet Arts in March 1999. We asked for\nand were lent the trolleys by Safeway supermarket\nwho have since been swallowed by Morrisons.\nThey were robust trolleys and seemed to\nembrace their new life, frequently displaying\ndetermination to take the team in their\nown unique direction.\nWe received funding in 1999 from East Midlands\nArts towards \"Bugs Away\", where\nthe 'Millennium Bug', villainously played\nby Haydee, poured green goo into Santa's\npixie making machine. We followed this the\nnext year with the sequel 'Grot around the\nClock' and the Millennium Bug and her disgusting\nsidekick Grotkins messed with Father Time\nand his Great Universal Clock. Maggie left\nthe group to work full time for Junction\n29 Nell and I mostly co-wrote the final\nPanto called \"Groundfarce\" in\n2001. The plot centred around the evil Alan\nTitbog and his dastardly cohort Cillerella\nand their conspiracy to deck the Secret\nGarden. After Groundfarce we ran out of\nsteam and stored the trolleys and Panto\nprops deep within the Fleet Arts cellars\nwhere they remained until 2009.\n13th Jan 2011 Candidate in the Oldham\nEast & Saddleworth By-election\nOldham was the second time I had\nstood in a by-election. Howling couldn't\ndo it as he was taking his annual\nleave in Malta.\nAll my nominations came from regulars\nat the Hanging Gate, Diggle. the landlord\nDave Bradbury kindly pointed them\nout in the electoral register of the\nsurrounding streets. I had picked\nthe register up on the 20th of December\n2010 at 10:30am, been first through\nhis doors later that morning and by\nmidday was strolling around stone\nterraces surrounded by open views\nof the moorlands collecting signatures.\nAt 3:00pm I handed my completed papers\nin to Justine at Oldham Council and\nat the same time met the Labour Party\nElectoral Agent and Paul\nNuttall the candidate for UKIP,\nwho were also handing in theirs. My\nmain policy at this election was 'to\nintroduce soft furnishings to the\nelections reception in the Oldham\nCivic Centre' as it was one of the\nbleakest rooms I've ever seen\nI was interviewed on the 10th of January\nin the Uppermill Park by Claire Ashworth\nwho had also interviewed me three years\nearlier when I stood at Crewe. I was just\nrecovering from a cold and the weather was\nperishing. It's a good thing the footage\nhas disappeared as I looked shifty and like\na corpse. Claire interviewed Militant\nElvis at the same time, we were a charmless\npair.\nHelen 'Bak, The Flying Brick, SamThing,\nTony Davis, Lord and Lady Tourette's, RU\nSeerius\nI had two local newspaper articles written\nabout me Report\nby Lewis Jones 21st Dec 2010 in the Oldham\nEvening Chronicle and Report\nby Stuart Greer 21st Dec 2010 in the Oldham\nAdvertiser\nThe count was held in The Queen Elizabeth\nHall at the Civic Centre, which was a great\nvenue. Bananaman had been in Oldham campaigning\nfor me for two days before the count without\neven telling me, that's probably why I achieved\nsuch a respectable vote. The press had a\nlarge balcony and in the early hours of\nthe morning I was invited to join Tony\nLivesey on Radio 5 Live round a table\nwith Hazel\nBlears and others. This is my Interview\nwith Tony Livesey on 5 Live in the media\nenclosure at the Count\nI came seventh polling 145 votes beating\nthe English Democrats, Pirate, and Bus-Pass\nElvis Partys.\n4th Jul 2010 Mad Cow Girl's death\nI don't fully understand why Roz decided\nto take her own life but she had been suffering\nwith depression for a long time. She had suggested\nshe was thinking of suicide to me and others\nover the course of the previous couple of\nyears, but it is a hard subject to engage\nwith in conversation. She was in debt and\ntold me she was declared bankrupt soon after\nthe Haltemprice election and had also left\nher job as an Intesive care nurse on mental\nhealth grounds. She had posted this explanation\non her website >>The\nFinal Straw<< in March 2009.\nI drove with RU to Roz's funeral which was\nat 11:00am on Friday the16th of July at Sunderland\nCrematorium. Afterwards we went to the wake\nat her friend Jean's house, where Roz had\nbeen a lodger in her attic. Dennis Warner,\nRoz's brother attended and was very good company.\nHe cycles great distances to remote places.\nThere was also a friendly and eccentric group\nfrom the 2CV owners club.\nSwim down into the darker depths of family\nhistory and you find little remains of those\nwho have gone. Much of the pleasure of being\nin the Loony Party, for me, is the pure and\nlazy narcissim of easy publicity. I hope in\ntwo or three hundred years there may be a\nlittle left to be still found of me embedded\nin the Loony vaults for one of my descendants\nto discover. This might be over optimistic\nas I see that Roz's story seems to be fading\nfast, her website has already vanished and\nthere is no credible archive.\nJean asked Neil Cook to take charge of Roz's\ncomputer and he kindly sent me the security\ndetails for www.omrlp.com which had been given to her by Boney in October\n2008.\n6th May 2010 General Election\nI was interviewed with RU on the\n19th Apr 2010, by German reporter\nAlexei Makartsev from the 'Rheinische\nPost' at The Old Kings Head, Belper.\nA few days later I was interviewed\nwith RU Seerius and Sam 'Thing also\nin the Kings Head, by Radio Derby Link to the audio of the interview\nThe three candidates in\nDerbyshire Sam 'Thing, RU Seerius &\nFlying Brick outside The Old Kings Head,\nBelper before we went to our respective\ncounts\nThe Ashbourne News, which is published\nweekly, ran three pieces around the\nGeneral Election, the first two had\nsubmissions from the candidates:\nAshbourne\nNews' Weds April 21st 2010 I addressed the problem of Ashbourne\nbabies being born at Derby City Hospital\nmaking them all Down'Ards at the Shrovetide\nFootball match.\nAshbourne\nNews' Weds May 5th 2010 I encouraged the Valhalla District\nCouncil to implement the smoking ban\nin the 'Vikings Horn', Eyjafjallajökull,\nwhere Odin was rumoured to have been\npuffing gently on his pipe causing\nsignificant disruption to European\nair traffic.\nAshbourne\nNews' Weds May 12th 2010 Which gave an account of the election\nnight.\nLizzie, Colin Swindell,\nHelen (Labour Candidate), ?, Flying Brick,\nLord Tourettes\n5th Feb 2010 >>Statement of Accounts for 2009<< to the Electoral Commission\n25th Sep 2009 Loony Party Conference\nThe Party Conference at The Raven Hotel,\nFleet had none other than headlining guest Adam Ant with a legendary performance\nof all his classics, an incredible night.\n19th Aug 2009 Bought the domain name\nwww.loonyparty.com\nI bid and bought the domain name www.loonyparty.com in an online auction by NameJet for $261-\n(£164.08) using party funds.\n23rd Jul 2009 Election Agent for Howling\nLaud at the Norwich North By-election\nThe Norwich North by-election was\nat a hectic time for me as I was married\nto Lizzie in Kirk\nIreton Church five days before\non the 18th of July. I drove to Norwich\nfirst thing in the morning on the\n7th of July, arriving at the Elections\noffice in Thorpe St Andrew to pick\nup the nomination papers when they\nwere opening. When you're trying to\ncollect signatures which have to tally\nwith the electoral register it's far\neasier to focus on a small area and\npull out the small parts of the register\nassociated with that area, in this\ninstance I got all my signatures from\nHL2 and HK2 which were drinkers and\ntheir friends from pubs along Yarmouth\nRoad.\nOn the Norwich by-election hustings\nHowling Laud was filmed by author\nDavid Lalé for his, as yet,\nunreleased documentary of the Loony\nParty.\nThe count was held at 9:00am on Friday\nmorning, the day after polling, in\na fabulous beautifully draped tent,\nwith chandeliers. It was at the Royal\nNorfolk Showground and called 'Walstans\nHall'. This was the first time I had\nattended a count in the broad light\nof day, it made a refreshing change,\nas I wasn't tired. During the count\nI wandered outside into the sunshine\nwhere I walked up to and introduced\nmyself to Theresa May who was sitting\non her own, with paperwork, at an\noutside table. She looked a bit concerned\nas I approached her so I mentioned\na mutual acquaintance who I had been\nat college with. After establishing\nthat I wasn't an axe murder and acknowledging\nme she dropped her head down and continued\nwith her work.\nImwyeddon, Howling and I appeared\nas one of the Wall Street Journal's Pictures\nof the day'.\n18th Jul 2009 Marriage to\nLizzie\nI only put my Loony Hat on briefly\nduring speeches on the lawn of The\nBeehive to deliver a poem:\nThere was a Lizzie Flat Five\nThe most beautiful girl alive\nSent me in a spin\nTruby stepped in\nAnd now we're wed, and at the Beehive\nRichard Delves, Matt Connell,\nThe Flying Brick, Lizzie, Robin Delves,\nJanet Delves, Top Hat, Fraggle, ?\n5th Mar 2009 >>Statement of Accounts for 2008<< to the Electoral Commission\n4th Oct 2008 Boney's contining refusal\nto rescind control of www.omrlp.com\nBy October 2008 everyone in the Loony Party\nwere fed up of Boney's continuing control\nof our domain name www.omrlp.com. I had spoken\nto her a couple of times and written emails\nrequesting that she release the access details\nbut she was adamant in her refusal to do so\nand worse had posted this page on the website. Boney's\nantagonistic webpage\nAfter consulting Howling and other Loony notables\nI opted to go for a heavier approach and sent\nher this letter Letter\nto Boney 4th Oct 2008\nIt did the trick and Boney released the username\nand password details to Roz who pointed the\ndomain to our new webspace although she refused\nto give the access details to any of the rest\nof us.\n10th Jul 2008 Election Agent for Mad\nCow Girl at the Haltemprice & Holden By-election\nBy-elections are like buses; you don't get\none for ages then they all arrive at once.\nThe week before I went to support Bananaman\nat Henley I drove north to Hull. I was the\nElection Agent for Mad Cow Girl in the Haltemprice\n& Holden by-election and I spent a few\nhours in the morning and early afternoon collecting\nnomination signatures in Cottingham. This\nwas followed by a dash to the council offices\nin Beverley where I kept an appointment to\nsubmit Mad Cow Girl's nominations and the\nfive hundred pounds in cash.\nRoz surprised all the rest of the Loony Party's\nactive membership by opposing David Davis\nwith a platform of support for the governments\nproposed bill of forty-two day detention.\nThere was a semblance of political debate\nwithin the party, for the only time I can\nremember, which gently concluded with a collective\n'what the hell' and a shrug of the shoulders.\nThere was a record of twenty-six candidates\nstanding so the Loonys along with the other\ncandidates were only allocated two counting\nagents. Roz and I were allowed a partner each\nso Howling came as Roz's partner and I took\nYvonne Elwood who was Lord Sutch's partner.\nThe two counting agents were Bananaman and\nEddie Vee the Yorkshire Elvis.\nThe count was at the Haltemprice Leisure Centre\nso we all met up at 'The Beech Tree', which\nwas conveniently over the road. David Bishop\naka Militant\nElvis, who was also a candidate, met us\nfor a drink and there was tension between\nhim and our Elvis from the start. Eddie Vee\nwas on fire and fully attired as Las Vegas\nElvis in his sequined and flared jumpsuit,\nwhereas Militant Elvis was in black leathers\nand not really enjoying himself.\nAll the photos and televised footage in the\nname of Militant Elvis at the count were of\nour Elvis Eddie Vee who completely usurped\nhim and stole the show.\nLater in the night I cornered David\nIcke in the restaurant upstairs and tried\nto introduce myself but he took one look at\nme and ran away, Howling told me that he probably\nthought I was an alien lizard. This by-election\nwas the last time Roz had any major involvement\nin the Loony Party.\n26th June 2008 Counting Agent at the\nHenley By-election\nThe Loony Party's keenest and most energetic\ncampaigner 'Top Cat' TC Owen threw his large\nbanana shaped hat into the ring for Henley.\nWe stayed at The Black Horse Hotel in Thame.\nThe night of the count was enlivened by the\nFur Play Party who provided several cases\nof wine in the reception area of the Counting\nHall.\n22nd May 2008 Candidate in the Crewe\n& Nantwich By-election\nCrewe & Nantwich was my first\nby-election, I was very pleased when\nHowling agreed to let me stand as\nI was certain about winning this seat\nfor the Loonys. The highlight of my\ncampaign was my interview with Claire\nAshforth where she interviewed me\nand some of the other candidates including Gemma\nGarrett who made the election\nand night of the count wonderfully\nglamorous\nLink to BBC news item 'Parties\nin final by-election push'\nAt the end of the night I obediently\nstood in the position I was directed\nto on stage. I looked across to see\nHowling with a cheeky grin hiding\nbehind the curtain and holding his\nfinger \"shhh\" across his\nmouth. Sure enough the old goat jumped\nonto stage at the declaration to grip\nthe winning candidate's hand, unstoppable,\na master at his game!\nThe Wikipedia\npage dedicated to this by-election states I have legally changed my name\nto 'The Flying Brick', I've never\ndone changed my name by deed poll,\nI'm honoured they are mixing me up\nwith RU Seerius who has.\nI came seventh out of ten beating\nan independent, Cut Tax on Diesel\nand Petrol, and Gemma Garret.\nImwyeddon, Sam Thing, Madam\nPomona, Howling, Flying Brick, Mad Cow Girl\nand Bananaman in 'The Shakespeare'.\n31st Mar 2008 My first submitted Statement of Accounts for 2007 to the Electoral Commission.\nSeptember 2007 Loony Party Conference\nat the Ommaroo Hotel in Jersey\nThere is a large Loony fraternity\nin Jersey led by The Jersey Flyer,\nthey organised the 2007 Loony party\nConference which they advertised as\nthe '2008 Conference' to confuse the\nhistorians. The conference was very\nwell attended with most flying in\nbut some like Boney, Stan, Dave Savage\nand the band coming across on the\nferry. There was an edgy atmosphere\nas Boney was being deliberately rude\nto as many people as possible, which\nleft Stan, and Dave looking isolated\nand uncomfortable.\nBoney's exit from the Loony Party\nwas truly bewildering; she hit the\nlarge red self-destruct button and\nseamlessly went from party matriarch\nto party pariah. I believe she over\ndid it and burnt out.\nThe highlight for me was my first\never cabinet reshuffle. It was held\nat its usual time of Saturday afternoon\non the magnificent Havre de Pas seafront,\nin the photo are Howling and the Jersey\nFlyer and his exceptionally fine cabinet,\nwhich we all shuffled about in.\nThere was a fairly dark mood in the\nevening when Dave and the Savages\nplayed in the large basement room\nof the Ommaroo, it was the last gig\nthey played for the Loony Party.\n19th July 2007 Counting Agent at the\nSedgefield By-election\nWhen Tony Blair stood down to let his old\nchum Gordon Brown have a turn as Prime Minister\nthere was a lot of excitement in Loony circles.\nWe expected the Sedgefield electorate to embrace\nNew Loony with the leaving of New Labour.\nI drove to Sedgefield to help Mad Cow Girl,\nwho was Howling's Election Agent, and Boney\nfind the nominations, which turned out harder\nthan anticipated. Roz and Boney had been great\nfriends for a long time and Roz was finding\nBoney's fallout with Howling and much of the\nrest of the Party depressing.\nA few weeks later the count was a very sombre\naffair with no Labour 'big guns' turning out\non the night and a very heavy police presence.\nI was also horribly sober as the only bar\nwithin walking distance closed as soon as\nI turned up! The only thing notable I remember\nof the night was meeting Norman\nScarth and reading the crazy leaflet he\ngave me Scanned\nLeaflet\n11th July 2007 Appointed Loony Treasurer\nHowling had to fill a lot of vacancies during\n2007. Baron von Thunderclap took the membership\nwith Chinners doing the merchandise and RU\nSeerius became the webmaster.\nThe Electoral Commission requires that the\nTreasurer is their main point of contact.\nHowling originally registered William Buxton\nas Party Treasurer but I got the job when\nWilliam declared he was moving to Russia.\nI was registered as Treasurer on the 11th\nof July 2007.\nBoney Maroney\nIn May 2007 Mel Staniforth resigned as Deputy\nLeader, Party Secretary and Treasurer. This\nwas the last membership letter she sent out >>Membership\nCircular<<\nBoney had increasingly run the Party since\nLord Sutch died. Howling, Boney and Roz (Mad\nCow Girl) fought for, and retained control\nof the Party from Chris Screwy Driver's leadership\nchallenge in 1999. At that time Boney and\nRoz divided the administration between themselves,\nBoney looked after the membership and merchandise\nand Roz was treasurer, party secretary and\nran the website. While she was treasurer Roz\nbought the www.omrlp.com domain name and wrote\nthe constitution, but within a couple of years\nshe suffered from stress and had to resign.\nShe gave control of the domain name and all\nthe treasurer paperwork to Boney driving down\nto Holmfirth from Sunderland in her 2CV in\nJune 2001.\nFor the six years between 2001 and 2007 Boney\nlived and breathed the Loony Party, she kept\nthe membership at record highs, oversaw the\nproduction of the best T-Shirt designs by\nDave Savage, liased with the Electoral Commission\nfilling in expense forms and cajoled Stuart\nEstell 'The Flying Pasty' into creating a\nmodern website. In short she efficiently administered\nand ran the party. Sometime in 2006 she decided\nthat it was time for her to be leader and\nrepeatedly told Howling she expected him to\nstep aside, which he did not feel was necessary.\nI suspect that most, if not all, Loony Party\nmembers are loyal to Howling as leader, as\nhe is friendly, consensual and an excellent\npublic speaker with an uncanny talent for\ndelegation!\nIn the first half of 2007 Boney rang a lot\nof Party members in an unsuccessful attempt\nto instigate a mass defection to Captain Sensible's\nnew Blah!\nParty. In the end the only people that\nwent with her were her husband Stan who is\nthe drummer in The Savages, Dave Savage and\nStuart Estell the webmaster at that time.\n29th June 2006 Counting Agent at the\nGwent By-election\nI was one of Howling's\n'Counting Agents' in his bid for parliament\nin the Gwent By-election, we stayed\nat the Ebbwvale Hotel in Abergavenny.\nWilli Beckett and I did a lot of campaigning\nwhile being driven about by Mad Cow\nGirl in her 2CV \"Boat Voony - The\nDyslexic Manicfesto!\" Willi died\non the 2nd March 2007. At the same time\nJohnny Cartwright aka Kernel Coco Bean\nstood in the Bromley and Chislehurst\nBy-election.\n5th May 2005 Candidate in the West Derbyshire\nGeneral Election\nI have confused feelings about standing\nin the 2005 election for West Derbyshire,\nmy partner Lynne (Lady Constance D'Cavelier)\nhad suffered back-ache over the first\nhalf of the previous year and in the\nautumn of 2004 was diagnosed with\ncancer. The first months of 2005 were\na very emotional time with Lynne going\nin and out of palliative care. Standing\nfor the Loony Party seemed completely\nunimportant but Lynne asked me to\ndo it and it was a distraction.\nI was interviewed at the Medical Centre\non Compton St., Ashbourne by Marsha\nRamroop on Andy Whittakers Radio show\non Radio Derby 18th Apr 2005.

When I told him\nI was in Hartlepool as Howling's 'Election\nAgent' he enthusiastically found me\nall ten nominators, most of whom came\nto the Melbourne Hotel to sign the\nNomination Paper while I was having\nbreakfast!\nWhen I returned to Hartlepool three\nweeks later Howling was conducting\nhis campaign from aloft George's Fire\nEngine closely followed by Mad Cow\nGirl in her yellow 2CV with a medley\nof Sutches campaigning songs blaring\nfrom speakers perched on her bonnet.\nIn early evening most of the Loonys\nmet up in the closest pub to the Counting\nHall where there were also a lot of\nFathers 4 Justice dressed up in super-hero\noutfits.\nAt the end of the count Fathers 4\nJustice candidate Peter Watson made\nthe Liberal candidate Jody Dunn cry\nwhen he threw purple dye over her\nbecause she was a family lawyer.

September\nissue of The Derbyshire Life\n15th Jul 2004 Election Agent for RU Seerius\nat the Leicester South By-election\nI was RU's Election Agent at Leicester South\nand 30th Jun drove to the Council Offices\nin Leicester, collected the 'Register of Electors'\nand set off into the Constituency to find\nsupporters.\nIt was the first time I had looked for a 'Proposer'\na 'Seconder', a further eight signatures of\nregistered voters and a willing local 'Agents\nOffice' address outside my home area and it\nwas a struggle. Naively I started in very\ndown-trodden areas and eventually mid-afternoon\nfound Aylestone, a civilised neighbourhood\nwhere the locals were delighted to nominate\na Loony candidate.\nWhen I submitted the completed forms late\nin the afternoon the Returning Officer Tom\nStephenson found that one of the nominating\nsignatures although on the printed register\nwasn't on the updated computer version and\nhad to be discounted. He kindly advised me,\nquite correctly, to try The Vaults for another\nsupporter. It was a short distance from council\noffices and I was sorry that I had to leave\nthis pub quickly and rush straight back with\nmy completed paperwork.\nRU had an interview with Richard\nScotsman on Central TV and I was invited\nalong to display my shouting skills.\nThis photo on the right\nwas taken in the nearest pub to 'Saffron\nLane Sports Centre' just before we went\nto The count.

He was there encouraging his\n'Respect' candidate a rather wide eyed and\nyouthful asian lady.\nWhen I went to George outside the hall and\nshook his hand he looked at me keenly and\nasked if I \"was a supporter\"? I\nsaid \"no, but they are!\" pointing\nto Sam and Dale who were walking vigourously\ntowards us. They must have looked intimidating\nas he turned and briskly fled.\nSep 2003 Counting Agent at the Brent\nEast By-election\nThe next by-election was at Brent\nEast where I was quite drunk at the count.\nMy previous three experiences of attending\ncounts were that you needed to stock up in\nthe pub as the counts were dry. This was not\nthe case with Brent East. We had a few drinks\nin the pub only to later make the happy discovery\nof a bar at the count! Towards the end of\nthe evening I upset The comedy terrorist.\nWe stayed at Adelphi Hotel where I regaled\nBoney and Stan about my recent accident plummeting\nfrom the South African sky and my bedridden\nrest while my broken pelvis healed. Stan now\nrefers to me as 'Cathiter man' due to one\nof the many indignitys during that seven week\nordeal.\nAug 2003 Bonsal International\nHen Racing\nThis photograph was published in\nThe Matlock Mercury. It catches me\nputting 'Tikka' from Richards' Belper\nLane End racing stable through her\nracing debut at Bonsal International\nHen Racing. Tikka was quick off the\nmark, but sadly lost interest shortly\nbefore the finishing line. Here I\nam supporting my hen while the two\nchildren with competing hens aren't\nshowing a lot of interest. The camera\nangle gives it a funny edge as it\nlooks like I'm leaning and pushing\neveryone else out! I was incorrectly\ncalled Dave Allen in this article\nand hoped to be called O'Mahony in\n2004.\nFeb 2002 Counting Agent at the Ogmore\nBy-Election\nBoney rang asking if I would like\nto go to the Ogmore\nby-election. I had just finished\na building project in Wirksworth converting\n13, St John St, in Wirksworth into\n2 flats and a curry shop so for the\nfirst time in ages I had the time\nand the money to afford a holiday.\nLeslie Edwards aka 'Guitar Fender'\nhad been a school teacher and was\nour candidate in Ogmore, he told RU\n'I wasn't well, but I'm better now'.\nHe was sponsored by 'the man who is\nDel Monte'. Guitar Fender was a wonderful\nchap and I had a great time for a\ncouple of days campaigning with him,\nRU, Boney, Stan and Howling. At the\ncount we met Captain\nBeany\nI must have been influenced with meeting\n'the man who is Del Monte' and Captain\nBeeny as two months later in April\nI was an orange octopuss in 'Ground\nFarce' a Pantomime at Fleet Arts in\nBelper.\nI was now hooked on by-elections!\n2001 Loony Conference at\nYately\nI was very excited about attending the\n2001 Party Conference. There were a number\nof reasons, firstly I had just discreetly\nstood in another election, secondly the\nheadquarters had moved to the home counties\nbut thirdly, and by far the most important,\nI was aware that the Bishop had left the\nParty as he was part of the Kent lot.\nThis meant that I was the 'tallest loony',\nI remember driving down the motorway to\nYately in my Toyota Tercel going \"I'm\ngonna be the tallest loony, I'm gonna be\nthe tallest loony\" and laughing thinking\nfor the the first time in my life I was\ngoing to achieve something.\nI walked into the bar, ordered a late afternoon\ndrink, and met, for the first time, Johnny\nCartwright. I was keen to ask when the 'tallest\nloony' competition was? His answer appeared\ninitially to be cryptic but was brutaly\nto the point. 'Tallest Loony? they don't\nbother with that any more'.\n\"What do you mean? Why-ever not? The\nBishops' gone, here I am tallest Loony,\nI demand a competition.\"\nJohn Cartwright, looked up at me perplexed\n\"Lady Penelope, she's the tallest loony\".\nMy first conversation with John was the\nfirst and only time I've not believed him.\nHowling was very welcoming and told me I\nwas a 'Veteran Loony' as I had now stood\ntwice.\nA few months after the 2001 Conference I gatecrashed Philip Mark's Party on New Years Eve and met Lynne who was dressed as a space cadet. She later found her true identity as Lady Constance D'Cavelier \"but you can call me Bedspread\".\n7th June 2001 Candidate in the West Derbyshire\nGeneral Election\nI was sad when Lord Sutch's died\nin 1999 although I only met him once.\nThe only contact I had with the Party,\nbetween General Elections, was when\nI had been rung by Boney inviting\nme to the funeral in London. I was\ntoo daunted to go. Lord Sutch committed\nsuicide on 16th June, which is Howling's\nbirthday.\nI was only moderately aware of the\nstruggle that followed between Screwy\nDriver leading the Kent lot and Howling,\nBoney and Roz (Mad Cow Girl) for control\nof the Party.\nI have since been told by Roz that\nScrewy Driver used to give a ten percent\ndiscount to customers at his Ironmongers\non the Isle of Sheppey for members\nof the Loony Party. However he rarely,\nif ever, passed on the £10-\nmembership fee to The Golden Lion\nand kept the membership list close\nto his chest. Roz said that a bus\nload of Kent Loony Members stormed\nthe September 1999 conference at The\nGolden Lion in support of Screwy's\nleadership bid, but were successfully\nrepelled.\nI told the Holly Bush that there wasn't\ngoing to be a repeat of the mayhem at the\ncount and so only four of us attended. This\nwas a fortunate decision as there were some\nvery large police at the count who weren't\nto be taking any nonsense. Mr Wheatcroft was\nrelieved with our relitively sober state.\nIronically for me 2001 was by far the lowest\nprofile but highest scoring Election. I polled\n472 votes, which as of 2016, is still my voting\nrecord. This is a photo of me and Patrick\nMcLoughlin taken at the 2001 count.\n1997 Loony Conference at Ashburton and\nthe time I met Lord Sutch\nI rang and apologised to Howling about\nthe events of the count, he told me that\n'The Loonys don't do that' and was clearly\ndisappointed, but he was also insistant\nthat I should attend the conference.\nMonths later on a Friday morning I drove\ndown to The Golden Lion in Ashburton and\nset up my large tent next to the bottle\nbanks in the pub car park. There was a party\natmosphere when I walked in mid-evening\nwearing my cloak and turban, Dave and The\nSavages were playing. I was instantly spotted\nby Howling who grabbed my arm and introduced\nme to everyone including Lord Sutch who\nwas standing at the bar. Unfortunately I\nhave cocktail party hearing and a loud voice\nand was a little surprised and nervous to\nbe talking so suddenly to the Legend. I\nrather randomly told him that I had previously\nmet 'The\nChristchurch Wizard' and now that I'd\nmet him my life was complete, or words to\nthat effect.\nLord Sutch was taken aback and awarded me\nthe Shadow Ministry of Fluorescent Dog Turds\non account of my huge silver turban, which\ndid look like a large fluorescent dog turd.\nThe hat is now back in the Fleet Arts wardrobe..\nA 'Tallest Loony' competition was hastily\narranged and I was lined up in front of\nthe band equipment with Baron Von Thunderclap\nand The Bishop who was clearly the winner.\nThe Bishop had the appearence of an undertaker\ncarrying a briefcase, I was told the next\nday that he kept his life support in that\nbriefcase. At the end of the evening I had\ntoo much to drink and upset an Ashburton\nlocal and was helped back to my tent by\nBoney and Stan, the next morning I found\na badge on my tent awarding me '**** of\nthe month' which I wore to breakfast.\nThe Isle of Sheppey Loony Party members,\nwho two years later were to try and take\nover the party, were all having breakfast\nthat morning, Chris\n\"Screwy\" Driver, his wife,\nThe Admiral and others were quite a presence.\nAt midday a large group of Loonys in regalia\nwent on a tour of Ashburton's pubs led by\nHowling Laud. I was invited along and drank\norange and soda. Before we entered each\npub the Admiral would give a shrill 'Bosun\nCall' on his whistle.\nLater that night I met Dangermouse, who\nwas the Party Treasurer.\n1997 Candidate in the West Derbyshire General Election\nIn early 1997 I rang Howling for the second\ntime expecting and half hoping that there\nwas a Loony candidate standing in West Derbyshire.\nWhen he said there was not, I asked him if\nI could do it and he said 'yes'. The Loony\nvetting procedure was complete.\nI spoke to the Elections Office in Derbyshire\nDales District Council, they were very friendly\nand helpful, I paid the £500 in cash\nas required with nominations and JJ as Election\nAgent.\nI needed something to wear in my new Loony\npersona, so raided the fancy dress rails of\nthe Fleet Arts panto group, I wore a large\nsilver turban and a large braided cloak.\nInitially I had no idea what to say until\ndriving along the A6 by Milford with Nick\nEllis in the passenger seat shouting through\nmy barely working old French megaphone. He\nsaid a lot of nonsense then paused and shouted\n'Abolish Gravity'. Ever since then 'Abolish\nGravity' has been my Shadow Ministry.\nI had drunk for a number of years\nat The Holly Bush, Makeney so it became\n'Mission Control'. Many excellent\npolicies were written there some of\nwhich were printable. Having no comprehension\nof the 'gravitas' of the Election\nCount I invited my friends from the\npub to be 'Counting Agents'. On 5th\nMay everyone met at the Holly Bush\na little bit too early in the evening\nand the night started.\nI now know having been involved in\nnumerous by-elections, that the early\nstart to the night was foolish. In\nfact Howling Laud, who is an expert\nin election night etiquette, always\nstarts the evening fast asleep, having\nbeen in bed since the late afternoon.\nHe rises at nine'ish in the evening\nto meet with his troops at an Indian\nRestaurant. Refreshed, assembled and\nfed we then meander to the Count via\na few hostelries that he has befriended\nduring the hustings.\nLater in the evening our group moved\nfrom The Holly Bush to The Red Lion\non The Green at Matlock, a short walk\nto the counting Hall. Many of us had\nrun out of money when the pub called\ntime but Rob Lowe bought Eighty Pounds\nof further refreshment which was then\nstaggered up the road to the count\nat Sherwood Hall. The authorities\nrefused entry to the alcohol so we\nset up a makeshift bar outside the\nmain entrance. The photo shows us\nshortly later in the evening while\nwe were still behaving. I am wearing\nmy dressing gown for warmth.\nAlison, Debs, Chris, Robbie Do and\nGiles held themselves in a decent\nfashion, and melted away when the\nrest of us started to disintegrate\nafter this photo was taken.\nJJ picked a thimble off the counting table\ncausing a whole ballot box to be recounted;\nthis was almost certainly the last straw\nfor the Returning Officer Mr Wheatcroft.\nI had been mis-behaving by standing on chairs\nin the hall and shouting \"Vote Loony\"\nand Abolish Gravity\". Rob Lowe's unfortunate\nfall down the stairs from the upstairs balcony\ncompleted the mayhem. He was in a Monks\nhabit and jettisoning alcopops and cans\nof beer exploded after him. Rob has since\nwritten his interpretation of the night\nin his book 'A True British Eccentric'. Scanned British Eccentric Page 46 &\n47\nLooking back I am grateful for the lenient\nand measured response from Mr Wheatcroft\nand the doorman, who I believe was the Chief\nSuperintendent of Derbyshire. It's surprising\nwe didn't all get a ride in 'JJ's taxi'\nto bed and breakfast at Chesterfield Police\nStation. JJ amused himself for the night\nby ringing the alarm bell and holding his\nglass eye up to the viewing grill. The Officer\nin charge was quite unsettled and repeatedly\nsearched his cell for the mysterious object.\nJJ's finest trick in the Holly Bush was\nto drop his eye into your beer, causing\nmirth among your fellow drinkers but feelings\nof nausea as you completed your pint.\nThe local papers let me off lightly The\nDerby Telegraph with a small piece Scanned\nPage and Belper News kindly\npublishing my apology, their photo shows\nRob, JJ and me. Rob incorrectly gave his\nname to the photographer as his friend Edward\nTomlinson, who he used to play squash with.\nEdward wasn't too happy about it as he had\na good job with the Council. Scanned\nPage\nThe first time I voted and why I joined\nthe Loony Party\nI think that the first time I voted\nwas in the European Election of 1994.\nI can remember the excitement as I\nwalked to the Polling Station followed\nby the dismay when I looked at the\npolling card and found no Loony candidate\nto vote for. Soon afterwards I went\nto Derby Reference library where a\nkindly librarian found me the Loony\nParty phone number and address.\nHowling picked up the phone, when\nI began to complain about the lack\nof a Loony candidate I was genuinely\nsurprised when he told me that the\nonly way I could vote Loony at the\nnext election was by standing myself.\nI didn't make any decision to do so\nat that time but the seed of political\nactivity was sown.\nI am in this photo at the back in\n'The Lost Slipper Caper' A Fleet Arts\npanto Dec 1994. I painted the backdrop.\nAfter the conversation with Howling I duly\nsent him a letter and cheque for £10-.\nSome considerable time later I received a\nlarge envelope with an entirely disorganised\ncontent including my membership card no. 594.\nYears later I learnt that Howling required\nstaff at the Golden Lion to compile membership\npacks when it was quiet behind the bar. He\nor she would scoop leaflets and loony rubbish\nfrom behind the bar into the pack, writing\na random number on the membership card. Here's\nmy membership\ncard, Draft\nManifesto for General election 1992 and letter\nfrom Howling\nWhere I was in the General Elections\nof 1987 & 1992\nThe next UK General Election was\non the 9th April 1992. I was 27 years\nold, in New Zealand and working at\nVan Der Voort apple orchard in Ettrick.\nI was there a long time and drank\na lot of home made beer, I can't remember\never being aware there was an election\nback home.\nI didn't vote in the General Election\non 11th June 1987, I was 22 years\nold and in my final term at Cheltenham\nArt College. This is a photo of me\ntrying to make up a show, super quick,\non the front lawn of Pitville Campus\njust outside the bar in June 1987.\nIt failed to impress my art tutors\nhowever: They awarded me the academic\npinnacle of a 3rd Class Honours in\nFine Art Painting",

Shortly before her death in 1971 my mother gave\nus an old chocolate box containing some old photographs,\nnewspaper cuttings, a number of In Memorandum''\ncards and a simple family tree going beck to her great-grandparents\nHugh Pigott and Miriam Buxton. A faded sepia photograph\nof their tombstone in Faringdon Cemetery revealed that\nHugh had been born in Faringdon in 1797 and Miriam at\nAppleton in Suffolk three years earlier. Thus it was\nthat our interest in family history was goaded into\nlife and a clear indication given as to the area in\nwhich our Pigott enquiries had to begin.\nBut what about my father's family? I knew that my paternal\ngrand-parents had married in Sweden while serving there\nas 'officers' of the Salvation Army, and my\nfather and his three sisters had all been born there.\nI had also heard that my grandfather, George Henry,\nhad been 'kicked out' by his father because of his\ndetermination to join the Salvation Army, and that great-grandfather\nJohn Henry had been a native of Sheffield but had ended\nhis days in Stoke-on-Trent.\nWe had no supporting documents at all but we did not\nworry unduly as we were confident that my father and\nhis youngest sister would prove a mine of information.\nMother's box of odds and ends included a large photograph\nof John Henry and his family. This we showed to father.\nHe had no hesitation in identifying his grandfather\nand went on\n. . . that's grandma Ellen - can't recall her maiden\nname - and that's aunt Alice who marries Luke Sant.\nThat's uncle Arthur - can't remember much about him.\nAh! that's uncle Sidney who lost the sight of one eye.\nI always liked him best - he was such a gentle man.\nI remember we stayed with our grandparents at their\nshop in Stoke after we came home to England - about\n1905. We must have been an awful trial to them - we could\nhardly speak a word of English then!\nThat was about the sum total of information we obtained.\nWe were amused but unconcerned when father hinted ominously\nthat be were 'certain to find a skeleton in the cupboard'\nbut a trifle apprehensive at his repeated assertion\nthat there had been a change of name somewhere along\nthe line.\nBut no amount of probing, then or later, produced\nany further details apart from the fact that his mother's\nmaiden name had been Eliza Ann Washburn.\nBut before describing our enquiries into the affairs\nof more remote generations it may be sensible to give\nan account of my father's life.\n1959 Three Trees, Felix Drive, West Clandon,Surrey,\nhome to Hetty BRAMHALL, seen here with her daughter\nOlive\n1964 Christmas at Godfrey and Lilly BRAMHALL's house\nStanding top left, David ? | Bunty DAVEY nee BRAMHALL\n| Grandpa William BRAMHALL | Seated at back with\nspecs, Godfrey BRAMHALL | Seated back right Peter\nDAVEY.\nFrom left seated middle row Lily BRAMHALL | In front of\nher wearing a black top Joan FORD nee BRAMHALL\nholding her son Martin FORD | Next to Joan wearing a white\ntop is Rosemary Jean BRAMHALL and in front of her Nicholas\nDAVEY.\nSeated in front of Godfrey in the middle on the\nright wearing a dog collar is Chris WANSEY in front of him\nis Olive WANSEY and front right of her is 'sulky' Margaret.\nIn front of Peter DAVEY on the right is Geoffrey\nDAVEY and on the far middle right is Grandma Henrietta\nBRAMHALL nee PIGOTT\n1956 Geoffrey DAVEY playing the piano at Woodford Rectory\n1956 Richard and Rosemary BRAMHALL in Woodford Rectory\ngarden\n1956 Joan FORD nee BRAMHALL with Geoffrey DAVEY son of Peter & Bunty DAVEY nee BRAMHALL\n1956 June Olive WANSEY nee BRAMHALL with Geoffrey DAVEY\nat his baptism |\nLilley Cottage garden\n1956 June Olive WANSEY nee BRAMHALL with Geoffrey DAVEY\nat his baptism |\nLilley Cottage garden\n1954 John FORD & Joan BRAMHALL Wedding at County\nHall, Cambridge\n28 July 1951\nBunty BRAMHALL & Peter DAVEY Wedding | St Marys Church, Woodford\nBridesmaids,\nJoan BRAMHALL | Margaret WANSEY (Centre) | Anne\nDAVEY, Peter DAVEY's sister\nCirca 1950 Joyce Megan (Bunty) BRAMHALL\n1948 David John & Richard BRAMHALL, Godfrey & Lily BRAMHALL's sons with Margaret WANSEY | At grandma Henrietta\nBRAMHALL's (nee PIGOTT) house Roslyn Gdns, Gidea Park.\nRichard BRAMHALL writes I remember that tree and the bench that encircled it.

For I have\nhad to fix up a meet with a sub editor that day in Westminster\nand as I shall be leading a group discussion in the\nevening must try and hold myself in or I shall be staggering\naround like an old man?!

Our best wishes again to Barbara\n- tell her there is a gleam of hope for her as she is\nmarrying a Yorkshireman.\n* They are the salt of the earth - though of course,\ntheir nature modesty and lack of pride in their county,\ninhibits them badly and they don't recognise it!\nYour Uncle Jack\n* This considered opinion due to my early ministry at\nEastbrook Hall, Bradford\nMy Mum met my Dad 'Dick' skiing in Sauze d'Oulx, Italy in 1963. She was on the way to Cyprus with 'Mad Mave' from St Thomas's. They were to meet with Dorothy her mother in Cyprus. They took the wrong boat from Italy and Dad thinks they ended up in Albania! In Greece Mum met Alberto who owned Orange Groves, Dorothy liked Alberto. Dad used to drive down to Croydon every weekend from his job at Mintex Brake Liners. Mintex had arranged a crammer 'Dictaphone' course in German for Dad in Bradford as they had bought into a German company and wanted Dad to oversee their overseas operations. Dad crashed out of the course. When Dad met up with mum at Newton Solney in a music club they played a record 'Et Maintenant' by Charles Aznavour\nThey married in Addington, Croydon a year later. Dad was very soon put in his place, when he bought a house in Derbyshire at auction.

(was that the name of your neighbours\nso carelessly treated by their children?), let alone the\nClark Gibsons, being left to themselves whilst their family\ngo about their lawful occasions, seem negligible.\nI'm thinking of writing to \"The Times\" about\nit, or even asking The Croydon Corporation to think again\nabout the J.P.s they put in office.

I had walked along to the 'Times' Office to see the coloured photographs of Charles and yourself displayed in the window. Behind me two girls were also looking and I heard one say - 'Doesn't she look young! You could take her for Princess Elizabeth couldn't you. But it's like her isn't it.' Who these people were I don't know, but I felt fully in agreement with their observations.\nMoreover, I had all day been connecting you in my mind with another royal personage - The Duchess of Kent.\nWhen I looked at you, that is who I felt strongly reminded of. And I thought that even the Duchess of Kent at her very best could not have looked smarter. I think you struck a most perfect note, and nothing nicer could have been turned-out by even the like of Norman Hartnell you looked perfectly and truly 'swell'.\nThere were two other women I also admired. One was Mrs Marshall - to whom I would apply the word 'chic'.\nThe other, I don't know who it was, but she was shortish, a little elderly and she was dressed in a soft blue. It was not the clothes, but the very beautiful triple row of pearls she was wearing. They were lovely.\nAltogether Dorothy I thought it was a grand day and very enjoyable. A very tiring one for you both and I expect you were glad when you were quietly back at home. If there is ever any little thing I can do such as minding house or anything at all, please know that I should only be too glad to help, and never hesitate to let me know.\nGood luck, good health and a very happy year to you\nboth. with love, Reg\n1949_Croydon_Advertiser_Ald_GIBSON_21_Jan.pdf\n1949_Letter_Audrey_NESBITT_to_Dorothy_GIBSON_19_Jan.pdf\n1949_Letter_Audrey_NESBITT_to_Dorothy_GIBSON_19_Jan_Typed_Out.pdf\nAug 1948 Bovey Tracey, Devon\nThey went in two cars, so CH could do some independent touring.

Henry GIBSON and his children\nseems correct. I do not know much more except what I heard\nfrom my father. For instance that Henry used to line up\nhis children in the study armed with a tuning fork and\nget them to sing Do, Ray, Me etc. which when all were\npresent, left two spare! He also used to do chemical experiments\nwith them, conduct magic lantern shows with the light\nprovided with gas, in a leather bag on which my grandmother\nwas required to sit in order to keep up the pressure.\nAt one point the whole thing caught fire and Henry bore\nit down the aisle and out of the church without anyone\nbeing much injured.\nOne of my father's earliest memories was at the age of\nabout four sitting under the kitchen table and being almost\novercome with the family excitement when a new parcel\nof books was being unpacked. I think Henry read Darwin,\neven though he probably disagreed with some of it.\n1882_Order_of_Methodist_Services.pdf\n1881_Birth_Certificate_Charles_Herbert_GIBSON.pdf\nRegistration District Tiverton\nBirth in the Sub-district of Tiverton in the County of\nDevon\nNo. 20\nBorn, Twenty Second November 1881, Twyford Place, Tiverton\nU.S.D.\nName, Charles Herbert | Boy\nName of Father, Henry GIBSON\nName of Mother, Eliza Jane GIBSON formerly CLARK\nOccupation of Father, Wesleyan Minister\nInformant, Henry GIBSON, Father, Twyford Place, Tiverton.\nWhen registered, Twenty Seventh December 1881.\nRegistrar, Arthur Cruwys SHARLAND.\n1881 Census\nRG11 | Piece 0885 | Folio 74 | Page 20 |\n3 Medway Terrace, Rochester St Nicholas, Kent.\nHenry J.W.

Some of the shipwrights\nmoved to the Poplar area and continued shipbuilding there.\nOthers stayed in Kent.\nOur common ancestors are John Gibson and Mary in Chatham.\nSadly that's where the records run out. A few years\nago, Jean and I trawled the St. Mary's Chatham records\nfor about six months collecting the Gibsons then we\nsorted them out by marriages and baptisms into families\nI go back through two associated shipbuilding families\nthe Gibsons and the Fielders. The Fielders were from\nBucklers Hard in Hampshire and also drifted to Southampton\nand London to follow their crafts. Nelson's favourite\nship the Agamemnon was built there. During the Peninsula\nWars shipwrights were getting thirty shillings a week\nand agricultural labourers got sixpence a week for weeks\nworked and nothing if they didn't. Those employed in\nRoyal Dockyards were pensionable. Many were able to\nbuy properties and or became publicans and live fairly\ncomfortably in retirement.\nMy paternal grandmother was the child of a Gibson +\na Fielder and she goes back all the way to your John\nand Mary on her Gibson side. Jean's mother was a sister\nof my grandmother. We are second cousins and research\ntogether although we live miles apart. Collecting the\nGibsons was our biggest ordeal. I note that you have\na copy of the marriage of John Gibson and Elizabeth\nCheetham, that will give you some idea of the horrors\nof transcription all done long before anything was online.\nYou also have a copy of a baptism of the first Elizabeth\nGibson daughter of John Gibson and Elizabeth Cheetham\n(bap 30 Aug 1807) she was buried 7 May 1809 and second\nElizabeth was born 8 August 1811 bap 1 September 1811\nSt. Mary's Chatham.",

RICHARD ARMISTEAD. FORMER BINGLEY PUBLIC SERVANT\nThe death took place on Monday at Wells House, Ilkley,\nin his sixty-fifth year, of Mr. Richard Armistead, the\nwell-known civil engineer, of Bradford, and formerly of\nBingley.\nBorn at Long Preston, Mr. Armistead learnt his business\nwith Messrs. Smith & Gotthardt, land agents, surveyors\nand valuers, of Bradford. At the beginning of 1878, when\nquite a young man, he was appointed surveyor to the Bingley\nImprovement Commissioners, and later became clerk also\nto the authority, and he held the position until 1898,\nthe year when Wilsden and the Bingley outer district were\nadded to Bingley.\nThe twenty years he occupied the post were an important\nperiod in the development of Bingley, witnessing, among\nother things, the improvement of the Main Street, the\nprovission of the Technical School, the Cottage Hospital,\nand the new railway station, and the taking over of the\nMechanics' Institute in Main Street and its conversion\nto public uses.\nWhen he retired from the office there was a public presentation\nof silver plate made to him in appreciation of his services\nto the town.\nFor many years before giving up his public office his\nreputation as a surveyor and civil engineer of ability\nhad been increasing and extending, and he subsequently\ncentered his business activities at Bradford, with offices\nin Booth Street. He had considerable practise as an expert\nwitness in arbitration cases, and often appeared in such\ncases in which the Bradford Corporation were concerned.\nMr. Armistead leaves a widow and two sons. There were\nthree sons of the marriage, all of whom have seen service\nin the war. The youngest son, Second Lieutenant Tom Armistead,\nwas reported missing in 1917, and is presumed to have\ndied, no news of him having since been received. The other\ntwo sons have now been demobilised.\nTHE FUNERAL\nThe funeral took place at Undercliffe Cemetary yesterday.\nA service was conducted by the Rev. Dr. F.S. Guy Warman\n(Vicar of Bradford) at the Parish Church, Mr. H. Coates\npresiding at the organ.\nThe principal mourners were Mrs. Armistead (widow),\nMr. R.B. Armistead,and Mr. J.H. Armistead (sons), Mrs\nDelvis (sister), Mr. Delvis (nephew), Miss Delvis (niece),\nand Mrs. W. Armistead (sister-in-law).\nAmong those present were Messrs. F. Robinson, B.D. Fairbank,\nWilliam Illingworth, Wheater Smith, W. Prest, and A.T.\nSmith, Bradford Society of Architects and Surveyors),\nand Messrs. J.H. Hanson (Huddersfield), E.J. Silkcock\n(Leeds), S Shaw (Dewsbury), and J. Young (Bradford),\nYorkshire and North of England Surveyors' Association;\nMr. W. Pickering, Mr. W. Waud (Ilkley), Mr. R.E. Weatherhead,\nMr. J. Dale, and Mr. Sydney Kellett (Ilkley).\nOthers attending were Mr. W.E. Sharp, Mr J.L. Booth,\nMr. J. Greaves, Mr. Charles D. Swale, (representing\nMr Robert Feather), Mr. E.A. Wells, Mr. W.W.

Briggs, Mr. E.\nPriestley, Mr. Charles Platts, Mr. Henry Platts, and\nMiss Amy Platts (Bingley) Brown, Muff & Co., Ltd.,\nwere the undertakers.\n1919_Obituary_Richard_ARMISTEAD_02.pdf\nROUND ABOUT BINGLEY\nA Sad Coincidence\nIt was a sad coincidence, and one which came with a shock to many in Bingley because of its unexpectedness, that his predecessor in the office of clerk to the Council, Mr Richard Armistead, should die three days later. His absence from the funeral of Mr Platts was noted by some, and the reason for it was asked among them, but it was not until the morning following that they learnt of it.\nMr Armistead too had played a notable part in the local government of Bingley, and much was accomplished during the twenty years he held office, first under the Bingley Improvement Commissioners and latterly under the District Council, the successors to the Commissioners. He came to Bingley in 1878 as surveyor, a young man, but one who quickly made good and early displayed the abilities which ultimately brought him to a high position in his profession. At first surveyor only, in a few years he combined with that post the office of clerk to the authority. It was as mentioned, a busy period in the development of Bingley, for it witnessed the improvement of Main Street from Park Road downwards, the negotiations and arrangements which led to the erection of the present railway station, and the taking over of the Mechanics' Institute for public purposes and the establishment there of the free library and the public baths. Many other things were also accomplished - there was the provision of the Cottage Hospital and the building of the Technical School and in all developments Mr. Armistead took his part.\n1919_Death_Certificate_Richard_ARMISTEAD.pdf\nRegistration District, Wharfedale\n1919 Death in the Sub-District of Ilkley in the County of York.\nNo 455 | When and Where Died, Twenty First April, Wells House Hotel, Ilkley, MD\nName; Richard ARMISTEAD | Male | 64 years | Profession, Surveyor and Valuer\nCause of Death, (1) Broncho Pneumonia, (2) Influenza, Certified by Henry VEALE MRCS\nDescription of Informant, JH ARMISTEAD, Son, Present at the death, Wells House Hotel, Ilkley\nWhen Registered, Twenty Third April 1919 | Registrar; Harold KABERRY\nNewspaper Article published in 2014 about the death of Tom ARMISTEAD\n1917_Tom_ARMISTEAD_Newspaper_Article.pdf\n1917_In_Memory_of_TE_ARMISTEAD.pdf\nLieutenant Tom Elsworth ARMISTEAD MC Obituary - Copied\nfrom the 'Lancing College War Memorial' website:\n2/6th Battalion (Prince of Wales Own) West Yorkshire\nRegiment (TF)\nDate of birth: 12th February 1895 | Date of death: 3rd May 1917\nKilled in action aged 22 |\nCommemorated on the Arras Memorial Bay 4\nTom Elsworth Armistead was born at Bingley in Yorkshire\non the 12th of February 1895 the third son of Richard\nArmistead, a civil engineer and surveyor, and Sarah\n'Sally' Ann Eliza Townsend (nee Walker) Armistead\nof Wells House, Ilkley in Yorkshire.\nHe was educated at Ripon Grammar School and at Lancing\nCollege where he was in News House from January 1909\nand Olds House from January 1909 to July 1913.\nHe was a Sergeant in the Officer Training Corps, was\nin the Football XI in 1911/12 and was appointed as a\nHouse Captain in 1912.

During this period the British artillery\nwould cease fire for 27 minutes to enable the two attacking\ngroups to complete their tasks.\nThey informed Brigade that they were in position at\n3.15 am.\nAt 3.30 am the German artillery put down a heavy barrage\nacross No Man's Land which gradually spread down the\nline and at 3.45am the British artillery commenced their\nbombardment of the line to be attacked with the troops\nmoving forward at the same time.\nThe West Yorks advanced in four waves but soon lost\ndirection due to the smoke from the barrage and were\nhampered by the hail of rifle and machine gun bullets\nwhich were sweeping No Man's Land. On the right of the\nattack, A Company attempted to correct their direction\nbut very few of them made the enemy wire and those that\nthat managed to get into the trench were killed or captured\nby a German counterattack.\nB Company suffered a similar fate, most being killed,\nwounded or captured. As a result no link with the Australians\nwas possible. C Company, on the left, were more successful\nand occupied a trench in front of Bullecourt but were\ncounterattacked, ran out of bombs, and were forced to\nwithdraw. D Company managed to get as far as the village\nchurch but as their path of retreat was cut off, little\ninformation is known as to their fate. At the end of\nthe attack the roughly 100 survivors of the battalion\nfell back to their original positions.\nFollowing his death probate was granted at a hearing\nin Wakefield on the 9th of October 1919 and he left\n£1,409 to his mother in his will.\nThe screen which forms the entrance to the war memorial\ncloister at Lancing College was given in his memory\nby his two brothers, Colonel Richard Burnie Armistead\nMC, 6th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment and Captain\nJames Henry Armistead OL (Heads House 1908-1911), 5th\nBattalion West Yorkshire Regiment.\nCirca 1913 The Boat House, Foulbridge, Colne, Lancashire,\nowned by Richard ARMISTEAD.

Eight\nhens survived from the flock of eleven, and the\nnext day the three brothers were lined up in the\nsitting room by policeman and they confessed.\nThey were gated for several weeks.\nFred bought a new chicken shed which was taken\nwith them when they moved to Heathfield in 1951.\nThe new chicken shed was later to be the perfect\nlocation for Dick to propose to B in 1963!\nCirca 1944\nRobin DELVES writes\nThe photo was probably taken in the late war years. They are Mrs SMALLBONES, Mr WADE who was an ex railway man who gardened in the mornings Monday to Friday, and and the taller woman was Mrs HOWARTH.

Phoebe, their mother, had a car but petrol was scarce due to the war. The three young boys were chaperoned to school by a ten year old girl, who escorted them from Denolm railway Station. The children travelled in a railway car pulled by steam train. The journey started through a tunnel and over the Hewenden viaduct near Cullingworth. The remaining distance to school from Keighley railway station had them rushing along two bus rides with a change at. The buses often had open stairs at the back.\nThe boys attended Bradford Grammar prep school at Saltaire for about a year, before going to the main school and after leaving Keighley Girls Grammar School.\nCirca 1940 Kate ELLIS on the moor\nThey lived at Bracken Hill between 1936 - 1951.\nFred & Phoebe did not own Bracken Hill it\nhad previously been Mr Foster's house who was\nthe owner of the Mill. In 1939 Fred bought Ballabooye\nFarm, St. Germains on the Isle of Man, so if the\nGermans invaded they would be able to feed themselves.\nThey had family holidays there during the war\nand saw detainees behind fences. Fred sold the\nfarm in 1964 as none of his sons were interested,\nhe used the money to pay off the mortgage on Heathfield,\nwhich cost about £4,000 in 1964. During\nthe war Fred was Major in the Home Guard and frequently\ndefended The Flappit pub in Denholme. He answered to Colonel DICKSON who made who had made his money in peace time making bobbins for the mills. Colonel DICKSON answered to FW's cousin Bernie ARMISTEAD. The main concern\nof the Denholme Home Guard was that the Germans\nwould invade by parachuting onto the moors.\nDuring the war the Fosters and Fred Delves were\nthe only ones in Denholme with cars.\nhttps://www.forces-war-records.co.uk\nF W Delves | Nationality: British |\nInformation: Lt late E.

The nickname 'Dad's Army' was due to the average age of the The Home Guard volunteers. They were usually ineligible for military service because of their age.

The service was presided over by Mr FW Delves (president of the branch). The 6th Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment band was in attandance, and those taking part in the service were the Rev EAJ Miller (Vicar of Denholme) and the Rev Cannon R Whincup (Bradford).

Within the colllection were thirty two '127' negatives, clearly dating from FWD's war years. FWD must have owned a 'Vest Pocket Kodak' folding camera for at least part of his military service during the 1st World War. Nothing is written on the negatives and I can only speculate about the order in which they were taken. There do not seem to be any photos of his first posting in Selonika. I believe Fred may have bought the camera when he attended a cavalry officers’ training course in Zeitoun near Cairo between 19th Jan – 17th Feb 1918. I imagine that the junior officers would have made good customers to one or two camera shops in the Cairo bazaar!\nSome images are taken at the pyramids of Giza, another looks like it is of the Senusret obelisk and others have palm trees in their backdrops so I have assumed these date from the same weeks that Fred attended the cavalry officers’ training course in Zeitoun near Cairo. I could be wrong as he passed through Egypt on other occasions. Having been to Egypt myself and been blown away by scale and history of the pyramids I wonder if FWD was inspired to buy a camera to record them, so maybe they were the first photos? Some negatives are of British soldiers standing by their circular tents in arid terrain, there is one of two local boys of middle eastern appearence and one of possibly FWD leaning against a destryoyed tank - I have grouped these together in a 'Palastine' section based on little evidence. A four masted barque/schooner could have been taken at any point of his travels and two images taken at sea of ships travelling in convey, the closest of which is painted in 'dazzle' camouflage. I imagine these might have been taken on his way back to Europe and France, but again who is to know?\nCirca 1918\nTwo photos of Fred - maybe these were taken on his return back to the UK?\nCirca 1918 This is possibly Fred's return to Europe from Alexandria to Marseilles onboard the HMT ‘Caledonia’ (P&O Line)\nFred is listed amongst his unit’s officers who embarked 24th May 1918 at Alexandria on troopship HMT ‘Caledonia’ (P&O Line) for service in France.\nThe six other ships in the convoy were: The Canberra, The Indarra, The Kasiar-i-Hind, The Malwa, The Omrah, The Leasowe Castle. One of the ships in the convoy is clearly\npainted in 'dazzle' camouflage.\nHe disembarked at Marseilles on 1st Jun 1918.\nCirca 1918 A four masted schooner in an unknown port?\nWhat looks like a structure carved out of rock? To my eyes like the temples of Lalibela.\nCirca 1918 Man, possibly Fred, next to a destroyed tank - Is it a Mark I or a Mark IV? 1917_Summary_Tanks_in_Palestine.pdf\nCirca 1918 Fellow officers outside their British Army Bell Tents in an arid landscape - I believe these photos may have been taken when Fred returned to Gaza\nCirca 1918 Unknown place and minaret\nA flock of ostriches in an enclosure.\nA group of servicemen with what looks like a railway line in the background\nCirca 1918 Photographs taken by FW DELVES with his Vest Pocket Kodak folding camera. Two images of a market place in either Egypt or possibly Palastine\nCirca 1918 images from an unknown place probably in Egypt or Palastine.\nProbably the Senusret obelisk.\nThe pyramids of Giza\nCould this be FWD's barracks in\nZeitoun near Cairo?\nFamily Memories\nJohn DELVES and his brother Dick DELVES\ntalk about their father FW DELVES:\n'Fred was 19 years old in October 1915 at the start\nof the Selonika campaign. He was sent with his\nhorse. He never said very much about his experience\nin the war, apart from being in charge of five\nhundred mules!'\nAnother story that FWD described to his sons:\nHe been in a cavalry\ncharge, his horse was shot and killed from beneath\nhim, and he was wounded in the leg. He could hear\nthe Turks laughing at them from their positions\non the other side, he assumed this was due to\nthem being poorly equipped for the job. He found\nthis upsetting as he had a very close bond with\nhis horse. He believed this cavalry charge could\nhave been the last ever performed in war. Army\nordnance compounded the insult by replacing his\nlost horse with a bicycle. He 'went with\na horse, and returned with a bicycle.'\nThere was an uncertain memory by his sons that He shot and killed a Turk,\nwhich haunted him as he latterly considered them\nto be gentlemen.\nIt would seem that FWD still had a horse in the photo's he took in Palastine and Egypt, so maybe these events took place during that time and not the earlier period when he was in Selonika?\nRobin DELVES says that as younger children their father FWD would wave his ceremonial sword which was kept in the hall. He would point to a red mark on it and say it was 'the blood of a Turk.' This impressed the three boys very much.\nFW DELVES ceremonial sword dating from the 1st World War owned by Mark DELVES\nEngraved on it: F W DELVES | EAST RIDING YEOMANRY | HENRY WILKINSON | PALL MALL LONDON\nFW DELVES West Yorkshire Regiment badges\nhttps://www.forces-war-records.co.uk\nF.W.

King\nFrederick William Delves was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of the 6th Battalion of the Prince of Wales’s Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) on the 24 June 1915. He had previously been serving as a cadet of the Senior Contingent of the Officer Training Corps at Leeds University. The battalion was headquartered at Belle Vue Barracks in Bradford. It had recently raised the second of its reserve or training units, known as the 3/6th Battalion, and Frederick was posted into this unit to begin his own training and to gain experience of command. The battalion left Bradford 24 July 1915 and marched out to a training camp at Skipton. A few days later, the 'Bradford Weekly Telegraph' carried a group photograph of the battalion’s officers just before they made thier move, and Frederick is featured in it. 1915_Bradford_Weekly_Telegraph_30_Jul.pdf\nThe battalion later moved to Nottinghamshire, spending some time under canvas near Retford before going into huts at the large Clipstone Camp near Mansfield.

The Canadian\nMachine Gun Corps were formed in France in 1917.\nThe hat was a unique 'campaign hat'\nmade by Stetson, issued to the Canadian 19th Alberta\nDragoons and kept by the same regional parts of\nthe Canadian Corps Cavalry Regiment, the style\nof the 4 pointed 'crimp' on the top\nis called the 'Montana crease.'\nJeanne INGRAM from Cedar City, Utah, USA writes:\nGeorge was sworn into military service on 12 Apr\n1915. He was assigned to the Canadian Remount\nUnit from that date until 13 Oct 1916.\nGeorge DELVES service number was R. 561, but was\nlater changed to 49129. He was originally assigned\nto the 2nd Remount Unit (or depot) of the Canadian\nExpeditionary Force with a rank of 'Tpr.',\nI think that might mean 'trooper'.\nHe arrived in England on 31 July 1915 and was\nassigned to the French theater. On 13 Oct 1916,\nfollowing his promotion to Corporal, George was\ntransferred to the No. 3 Canadian Mobile Veterinary\nSection, which was part of the 3rd Canadian Division.\nHe may have been at the Somme at this time as\nthe 3rd M.V.S. did see action in the Battle of\nSomme, which ended 18 Nov 1916. If he was at the\nSomme he would only have been part of that unit\nfor the last month of the battle. The Battle of\nVimy Ridge was 9-12 Apr 1917 and the 3rd M.V.S.\nwas there, so it is likely George was also.\nHe was promoted to Sergeant on 21 July 1917. George\nbecame ill with rheumatic fever in Sep 1917 and\nwas in the hospital for some time before being\nreturned to Canada and was medically discharged\non 26 Jan 1918.\nIn the Discharge Papers of 26 Jan 1918 George DELVES\nwas described as being 6' tall with brown eyes and dark\nhair.\n1915_George_E_DELVES_Canadian_Attestation_Paper\n1915-17_George_E_DELVES_Service_Card\n1915-17_George_E_DELVES_Casualty_Form\n1918_George_E_DELVES_Discharge_Papers_26_Jan.pdf\nDanny DELVES from Jacksonville, Florida writes about\nhis grandfather George Edward DELVES, born 7th Jun 1889,\nLong Preston, Yorkshire.\n1917_Danny_DELVES_writes_about_George_Edward_DELVES.pdf\nGeorge Edward DELVES born 7th Jun 1889, Long Preston,\nwas the son of Thomas Hirst DELVES and Annie WRATHALL.\nMy Aunt Mary told me about five years ago this story which\nGrandmother Charlotte (George Edwards wife) told her many,\nmany years ago.\nAt Lockinvar, Thomas Hirst Delves had horses, I don't\nknow how many, but one was an Arabian that only he rode\nand which was used for breeding as they were quite a commodity.\nGrandfather George Edward had his own horse, but it was\nnot an expensive Arabian. Thomas Hirst prohibited the\nboys from riding his Arabian. It was definitely off limits.\nThomas Hirst Delves was away from home for a time on business.\nWhile he was gone, George Edward rode the Arabian, jumping\nover walls, fences, etc. on his way to a friend's (or\ncousin's?) home. George couldn't get the Arabian to make\none of the jumps and the horse broke a leg. George Edward\n(then between age approx. 19 or 20) had to shoot the horse\nto put him out of his misery.\nWhen Thomas Hirst came home, he saw that his prized horse\nwas gone and he learned what had happened. An extreme\nstate of rage overtook Thomas Hirst, the level of rage\nwas particularly described as a fit that Great-Grandmother\nAnnie Wrathall Delves had never seen.\nThomas Hirst headed up the stairs toward the room where\nthe guns were kept. Great-grandmother Annie knew (or feared)\nthat Thomas Hirst was so angry that he was going to get\na gun to shoot his own son, George Edward. Annie pulled\nher stash of money from a hiding place downstairs, gave\nit to Grandfather Delves, and whisked him out the door\nquickly, telling him to ride as far and as fast as his\nhorse could take him. All of this occurred within a very\nshort span of a few minutes.\nHe rode all the way to Liverpool to board a ship out of\nthe Country, flipped a coin as to which destination: either\nAmerica or Australia. He headed for America and made his\nway to Miles City, Montana where he worked as a rancher/cowboy.\nHe had raised, broken, and trained over 30 horses in the\nfive year span of time that he was in Miles City. He sold\nseveral of those horses to the Canadian Cavalry as WWI\nbegan and England was drawn into the war.\nThere you go cousin! Crazy Delves story fit for a movie\nscript. But very close to verbatim as told to me by Aunt\nMary Delves Prentiss, who is my father's older sister.\nWhen she told me this recently (about 5 years ago), we\n(my brother and sisters) only knew that Grandfather Delves\nleft England due to a disagreement with his father, but\nnever heard the story. I had always wondered. When she\ntold me this, I was shocked and saddened.\nBy the way, you know how people can embellish or add to\na story over the course of years? Well, this one just\nrolled out of Aunt Mary's mouth as if she could still\nhear it being told to her.\nI'd rather believe that it isn't true, or that things\ndidn't happen that way, but I don't believe she was weaving\na tale either.\nCirca 1916\nMarion DELVES (Presuming Marie to be 30 yrs old)\nAnn BANKART nee ROCHE writes about her aunt Marion\nDELVES in her letter to Baroness BOOTHROYD dated\n2005\n2005_Letter_to_Baroness_Boothroyd_about_Marrie_and_Madge.pdf\nI am therefore writing to tell you about my two\nquite remarkable aunts, both nurses and both decorated\nwith The Royal Red Cross Medal.\nI quote from the obituary:\nMiss Marion Delves was born on 28 Mar 1886 and\ndied 28 Nov 1972\nThe death has occurred of Miss Marion Delves,\nMoorgate Cottage, Long Preston. North Yorkshire.\nHeld in high regard, Miss Delves was well known\nin nursing circles, and she served in both World\nWars.\nShe trained as a nurse at Bradford Royal Infirmary,\nand joined the military nursing service.\nFirst stationed on Salisbury Plain she was engaged\nin nursing Maoris who were accommodated in huts,\nthe conditions being so bad that she herself fell\nvictim to pneumonia. When convalesced, she nursed\nat the Millbank Military Hospital in London, and\nfrom there went to Aldershot.\nHer first appointment abroad was at Delhi Military\nHospital from where she moved on to nurse in Tehran.\nShe was stationed also in China, Hong Kong and\nShanghai and in Egypt.\nShe had the rank of Principal Matron, and travelled\naround supervising all military hospitals and\nlecturing to orderlies.\n1912_Death_Certificate_Thomas_Hirst_DELVES.pdf\n1912 Death in the Sub-district of Long Preston in the County of York\nNo 466 | When and where died | Seventh September 1912.

Mr. G.M. Robinson, appeared for the complainant, and Mr. Tilly of Lancaster, for the defendant. The complainant stated that on the day named he and the defendant's father were disputing about a calf, when the defendant came in, and without any warning whatever dealt him three severe blows on the head, as the result of which leeches had to be applied to his eyes. In cross-examination by Mr. Tilly, the complainant admitted that he called the the old Mr. Delves a 'rogue' on account of the calf\n- Robert Mitton, farmer, Rathmell, gave affirmative evidence. Mr. Tilly admitted the assault but contended that complainant’s conduct towards the defendant’s father justified the course the defendant had taken.\n- Henry Morphet, of Wigglesworth, and John Heseltine were called for the defence. The former said that Lumb came across a room to old Mr. Delves but witness pushed him off. He heard Lumb describe the old man by the names 'rogue', 'thief' and 'dishonest' and the son, he said, was no better.\n- The magistrate said he considered there had been extreme provocation and, acting on the suggestion of Mr. Tilly, would inflict a nominal fine of 1s, without costs.\n1885_Death_Certificate_Ethel_Catherine_DELVES.pdf\n1885 Death in the Sub-district of Long Preston in the County of York\nNo 266 |\nWhen and where died | First January 1885, Long Preston\nEthel Catherine DELVES | Female | 3 hours\nOccupation | Daughter of Thomas Hirst DELVES Corn Dealer\nCause of Death, Premature Birth Certified by C W BUCK RCSE\nDescription of Informant Thomas H DELVES, Father, In attendance, Long Preston\nWhen registered, Third January 1885 | Signiture of Registrar, Richard Thomas Wildman\n1884_Will_George_DELVES.pdf\n1884_Will_George_DELVES_Transcript.pdf\n1883 Bend Yate (Presuming Annie WRATHALL to be\n25 yrs, Thomas Hirst DELVES to be 28 yrs, John\nWRATHALL to be 29 yrs, Mary Ann ARMISTEAD to be\n24 yrs.)\nAnnie DELVES nee WRATHALL, Thomas Hirst DELVES,\na WRATHALL sister (one of Annie's three surviving\nyounger sisters), John WRATHALL, Mary Ann ARMISTEAD\nAnnie WRATHELL Born 26 Oct 1858 in Long Preston.\nDied 17 May 1930 in Long Preston.

I do not know if\nspace further back was available to him, they certainly\nhad a field behind the house which the children played\nin, which they called the Croft, perhaps it was only rented\nto him, it is a bit of a mystery. Certainly the house\nwould have benefited from being further back, as it is\nit is right on top of the road and really rather ugly.\nHowever inside it is much nicer than you would imagine.\nIt got its name from my Grandmother who was very fond\nof Walter Scott novels and she opened Ivanhoe at random\nsaw the sentence 'Now young Lochinvar rides out of\nthe West' and so she chose the name! anyway that\nis the story I was told! I had never been in the house\nuntil about 20 years ago when we were visiting the church\nand got in conversation with a lady doing the flowers\nwho said that the house had been converted into flats\nand that her sister lived in the bottom one, this is how\nI got in. I saw the kitchen and the sitting room of the\noriginal house and also a room that Grandfather had used\nas his office. My Mother had told me how her mother had\nhad the staircase walls painted with a strong leaf green\ngloss paint in order to mitigate against children's dirty\nhands. The lady in the flat said that she had had a nightmare\ntrying to get rid of this paint and in fact it was still\nthere in the office now about 100 years old!\nI suppose with the attics there may have been 21 rooms\nbut I never heard anything about Arabian horses they certainly\nhad horses to ride and a pony for the trap. My grandfather\nDelves who, as I understand was a Corn and Cattle Merchant\nwas actually found dead in a barn by my mother, having\nshot himself (I think they tried to claim it was an accident)\nhowever this was at the time of the great depression and\nhis finances were not too healthy indeed the family, including\nmy father his son-in -law, all contributed to keep Grandma\nDelves in Lochinvar until her death, she died not long\nbefore I was born.\n1883_Memorial_Inscription_Agnes_George_DELVES.pdf\nSt Mary the Virgin, Long Preston, Yorkshire\nPlot Number D 96 | In Memoriam | Agnes wife of George DELVES | of Long Preston | died 13th November 1883 | aged 60 years |\nalso of the above George DELVES | who died June 1st 1886 | aged 68 years.\n1883_Death_Certificate_Agnes_DELVES.pdf\nRegistration District, Settle.\n1883 Death in the Sub-district of Long Preston in the\nCounty of York.\nNo 236 | When and where died, 13 Nov 1883, Long Preston\nName, Agnes DELVES | Female | 60 yrs\nOccupation, Wife of George DELVES a Farmer and Corn\nDealer\nCause Of Death, Constipation, Obstruction of the Bowel\nCertified by James W.

PLATTS\n1923\nMy grandmother Dorothy GIBSON nee PERKINS told me verbally in the 1990's about her her father, his death, her education and her family at that time.\nAlfred EA PERKINS was a station master at Addiscombe Station. During WW1 he was moved to Woolwich Arsenal Station. This was dangerous as ordinance was being dispatched to the front in France and there was danger of it exploding. He was sent on private missions with Sir Eustace MISSENDEN. Neither were permitted to join up. Alfred felt bitter about this as all his brothers went and only a few came back. He received white feathers from women because he wasn’t in uniform. Eustace and he had to escort VIP's. During the war he collapsed after a particularly urgent mission and was diagnosed as having had a burst 'quinney' lump in his throat. The doctor said that he would be safe as he had not swallowed it but later he developed a lung infection.\nAfter the war Dorothy was sent to school at ‘a private school' called Highfield in Lower Addiscombe Road, Addiscombe when she was 6-7 years old. She then went to Addiscombe College in Upper Addiscombe Road, but between 10-13 years Dorothy developed scarlet fever and couldn’t go to school.\nIn 1925 her father Alfred was operated on by General Sir Ernest COWELL at at Croydon General Hospital. The surgery went wrong, COWELL either sliced through an artery or punctured a heart valve and Alfred died at the age of 40 years.\nErnest COWELL went on to be given the 'Freedom of the City' with CH GIBSON. Later after CHG died Dorothy often found herself sitting next to him at functions. Ernest COWELL had a son who was the UK's first person to have a sex change [Roberta COWELL]. Ernest went on to make money from this, but his wife wasn't so pleased!\nAfter the death of Alfred her mother Ethel moved the family to 8, Addiscombe Court Road, East Croydon.\nUncle Reg, moved in, he was fifteen years younger than Ethel and worked at the Central Railway Offices and supported her and the three children.

Elizabeth and is in all probability descended from Matthew Ellis of Balkholme 1597\nBased on a compilation by Alfred Shelley Ellis made in 1870\nAlongside his Esparanto interests my great-grandfather John ELLIS also followed; a single name genealogical research group mapping the ELLIS family. The group published books called 'Notices of the Ellises'. These were published by Mitchel and Hughes 140 Wardour Street London. The fourth and last supplement was printed in 1881. My uncle John DELVES gave me the supplements 'three' and 'four' along with a huge hand-written family tree probably drafted by John ELLIS. In the late 1990's I attended the Latter Day Saints family history research centre in West Bridgeford, Nottingham. The facilities were available to non-members and were run by very knowledgeable ladies. One of the ladies there was so enthusiastic about the huge 'Genealogy of the Ellises' that I gave it to her after which she photocopied the half that was applicable to my direct family line. The original is likley to be stored in the Nottingham LDS archives.\n;",

Mr Mc PHAIL was a client of Dick KITCHING a solicitor. Pete WILLIAMS, who was a good friend of Dick KITCHING, was working with Dick DELVES and Pete LEATHLEY at Rolls Royce. KITCHING organised the sale.\nWILLIAMS and LEATHLEY borrowed their share from Dorthy GIBSON and her friend Wyn JONES a jeweller.\nThe company purchase included the building in Little Eaton a staff of ten men and tooling machines. Mr McPHAIL used the money to buy boat and run cruises up the River Dart in Devon. Mr McPHAIL had named the business PEL after buying 'FD Roe' from two brothers.\nDad had only just rejoined Rolls Royce after a break of four years working for Mintex in Yorkshire. He had returned to RR after marrying mother, she had refused to go any further North!\nSoon after buying Purpose Engineers the four partners employed Fred HANSON who enabled them to set up in 'Lost Wax Pattern Dies'. He had learnt the trade from working at H&F Precision Castings on Ascot Drive. The firm had been started by two dentists who used their lost wax skills to make turbine blades for Rolls Royce.\nBusiness boomed for PEL between 1965-71 and Dad employed two designers but they nearly hit the rocks when RR went into liquidation in 1971. They adapted by working for the nuclear part of Rolls Royce and Associates.\nA number of staff advanced on to greater things. Ken EGLETON later became a director of Abro Fab which is still going. Purpose Engineers received a large grant to move the business to Heanor in 1980.\n1981_Newspaper_Death_Madge_DELVES.pdf\nRepton School 1979 - Nick DELVES Count between 22 & 23 from right on back row -

I have been a member since 1972.\nI collected number 388 from Oliver Lee in person. Subsequent,\nhaving realised that the early boats took off the starting\nline slightly more quickly than mine, I bought 'Crimson\nDusk', number 30, from a farmer in Burnham. Hopefully\nshe will sail in Abersoch this summer. I have not yet\nruled out the possibility of sailing in Cowes in August\nat the 50th anniversary championship celebrations.\nThe purpose of this missive is to advise you of the victory\nof Burwain Sailing Club in the Wilson Trophy team race\nchampionship in1970 at West Kirby Wirral. All 3 Helmsmen\nbecame Squib Owners in subsequent years, and Nigel\nHarris won the squib championships at Abersoch in 2000,\nwhilst Roger Harris, had been Firefly National Champion\nin 1970. Roger also won the inland water championship\nin Merlin Rockets. For my part I can not claim any individual\nvictories. Pete Richards, who I note is the Chairman of\nThe Squib Championship Committee, was a member of the\nBurwain team at the Wilson in 1970 ,and he crewed for\nme at that event, in Fireflies, and he crewed regularly\nor me, in a Squib for nigh on 30 years, before he\ndeserted\nme for a younger man, namely David Best. Pete crewed,\nalso, for Roger Harris in A 470 and they were members\nof the RYA Olympic squad in, I think 1976,\nThey were runners up for selection to the Olympics, the\nUK being represented by Phil Crebbin, who, I believe finished\n6th.\n1972 Paul, Matt, Benita JONES, Nick, Susie, Janet,\nRichard DELVES\n1972 Lupin, Matt, Paul Richard, Chris JONES at Henrid Cottage, Sarn Bach, Abersoch\n1972 Nick with Dorothy GIBSON | Silverdale, Lower Road, Mackworth Village, Derby\nSummer 1972 Silverdale |\nThe climbing frame was at the bottom of the back garden\n1972\nNick, Dick, Paul, Matt & B DELVES | Waldringfield, Suffolk\nDick with Lupin a black labrador.

In that period several similar cases emerged in the newspapers of sane persons being incarcerated in lunatic asylums for the convenience or financial gain of their immediate families. The most prominent, other than Louisa Nottidge, was the case of Rosina Bulwer Lytton. This public hysteria was exploited by the writer Wilkie Collins, who published the best-selling novel The Woman in White in 1860. The case of Louisa Nottidge has remained of interest with respect to the rights of psychiatric patients, women's rights, and the conflict between freedom of religion and the legal process\nChildhood\nLouisa Jane Nottidge was born at her grandmother's house, Fulling Mill House, Bocking, Essex, in 1802.Her parents, Josias Nottidge (1762–1844) and Emily Pepys (1775–1863) were wealthy wool clothiers who worked fulling mills in Bradford Street, Bocking and in Wixoe, Suffolk. From 1794 her parents lived at a large house, with an eight-acre estate, called Rose Hill (Floriston Hall) in Wixoe, Suffolk. Louisa reported that from her early youth her reading had been directed mainly towards religious texts. She attended church regularly, with her six sisters and four brothers.\nThe Agapemone\nIn 1843 a revivalist clergyman, Rev. Henry James Prince, preached at the church of Stoke, near Wixoe. On the death of Josias Nottidge in 1844, the five unmarried sisters each inherited the sum of £6,000. Prince persuaded them to contribute to the founding of a religious community in Somerset, to be called the Agapemone, or Abode of Love. In 1845 the sisters travelled to Somerset with a view to residing at the new community; en route Prince persuaded three of the sisters—Harriet, Agnes and Clara—to marry three clergymen from the Agapemone.They were married in Swansea, on the same day, in 1845.\nAbduction\nPrince then encouraged Louisa to join her sisters at the Agapemone. After she had travelled to Somerset, her mother Emily feared the spiritual and financial influence that Prince had established over her daughters. Emily instructed her son Edmund, her nephew Edward Nottidge, and her son-in-law, Frederick Ripley, to travel down to Somerset and to rescue her unmarried daughter Louisa. The three men succeeded in removing Louisa against her will in November 1846, and imprisoned her in Ripley's villa by Regents Park (12 Woburn Place). Following her persistent claims regarding the divinity of Prince, her mother enlisted medical aid and had her certified insane, and then placed her in Moorcroft House Asylum, Hillingdon. Dr. Stilwell, the presiding physician, made notes on her condition and treatment, recorded in The Lancet.\nEscape\nLouisa escaped from the asylum in January 1848, travelling across London to meet Reverend William Cobbe from the Agapemone at a hotel in Cavendish Square. Cobbe was the brother of the campaigner Frances Power Cobbe. However, Louisa was recaptured two days later at Paddington Station. Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848.\nNottidge v Ripley and Another (1849)\nLouisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849); the trial was reported daily in The Times newspaper. Bryan Procter was called as a professional medical witness. The Lord Chief Baron pronounced a famous dictum that: \"You ought to liberate every person who is not dangerous to himself or to others.\" Louisa won the case with damages, proving that she had been illegally detained. Louisa then returned to the Agapemone, transferring her wealth to Prince, and remained there until her death in 1858.\nIn 1850 Charles Dickens reported on the case of Louisa Nottidge and the Agapemone.\nNottidge v Prince (1860)\nIn 1860 Louisa's brother and executor, Ralph Nottidge, sued Prince to recoup the money that she had given him as a result of his undue influence over her, in the case of Nottidge v. Prince (1860), reported daily in The Times newspaper. The Nottidges won the case, with costs. Punch Magazine then launched a campaign to encourage Prince to emigrate to America, to join Brigham Young and his Mormons in the Utah desert.\nHarriet Martineau wrote, in her biography of Bryan Procter, the following:\n'For many years Mr Procter held the lucrative but not very congenial appointment of Commissioner of Lunacy; the responsibility of which was irksome, and occasionally (as in the case of Miss Nottidge, who was carried off from The Agapemone) alarming to a man of sensitive nature, and a hater of conflict.'\nWilkie Collins dedicated his novel The Woman in White to Bryan Procter, poet and Commissioner for Lunacy.\n1844_12_23_Will_Josias_NOTTIDGE_Original\n1844_12_23_Will_Josias_NOTTIDGE_Transcript.pdf\n1841_Census_Ralph_Ann_NOTTIDGE_Family.pdf\nHO107 | Piece 1035 | Folio 13 | Page 18 | White Hall, Old Newton, Suffolk\nRalph NOTTIDGE | 40 yrs | Profession, Farmer | Not\nborn in Suffolk\nAnne NOTTIDGE | 30 | Born, Suffolk\nRalph NOTTIDGE 10 yrs | Born, Suffolk\nEdmund NOTTIDGE | 7 yrs | Born, Suffolk\nFrederick NOTTIDGE | 6 yrs | Born, Suffolk\nEmily NOTTIDGE | 5 yrs | Born, Suffolk\nMaria NOTTIDGE | 3 yrs | Born, Suffolk\nJohn NOTTIDGE | 1 yr | Born, Suffolk\nSamuel HUTTON | 25 yrs | Profession, Male Servant |\nBorn, Suffolk\nAlfred LAMBERT | 13 yrs | Profession, Male Servant |\nBorn, Suffolk\nBetsey SHAVE | 20 yrs | Profession, Female Servant |\nBorn, Suffolk\nCaroline MORPHY | 15 yrs | Profession, Female Servant\n| Born, Suffolk\n1841_Census_WELSMAN_Family.pdf\nHO107 | Piece 266 | Folio 10 | Page 43 | High Street, St Lawrence, Exeter, Devon\nGeorge WELSMAN | Male | 29 yrs\nEmma WELSMAN | Female | 25 yrs\nRobert WELSMAN | Male | 18 yrs\nRosina WELSMAN | Female | 4 yrs | Born, Devon\nEmma WELSMAN | Female | 2 yrs | Born, Devon\nLaura WELSMAN | Female | 1 yrs | Born, Devon\n1840_Birth_Certificate_John_Thomas_NOTTIDGE.pdf\n1840 Birth in the Sub-district of Stowmarket in the County\nof Suffolk.\nNo 116 | When and where, Twenty Ninth of April 1840\nJohn Thomas | Male\nName of father, Ralph Clarke NOTTIDGE | Occupation of father, Farmer\nName of mother, Ann NOTTIDGE formerly TURNER\nDescription of informant, Ralph C NOTTIDGE, Father,\nOld Newton\nWhen registered, Twenty Fifth of May 1840 |\nRegistrar, Spencer FREEMAN\nCirca 1885 (Presuming that Emily NOTTIDGE nee PEPY's grandchildren are still quite young)\nAn unsigned and undated black and white pencil drawing on card mounted on a wooden board.

On January 24th, Mr John Clark of Shorne,\nRidgeway, Rochester, passes to his rest. Shortly before\nhis birth in 1809, his father was converted at an open-air\nservice held at Cobham by Mr Osborn, father of Dr Osborn**.\nFrom that day he suffered for his attachment to Methodism.\nPersecuted, turned out of his small farm, he was obliged\nto take a small cottage, which he at once had licensed\nfor Methodist preaching.\nHere John Clark was born in an atmosphere of self-denial\nfor the Church's sake. His parents became very poor\nin consequence of persistent efforts used to prevent\nhis father obtaining work in the neighbourhood. When\nseven years old he was expelled from the National school\nfor being a little Methodist. Before he was twenty he\nwas truly converted.\nIn 1836 when most of the members at Shorne had joined\nthe Association movement, he bought the ground for the\nchapel, and afterwards he bought the chapel itself:\nand in 1882 he presented it, free of debt, to the Wesleyan\nconference.\nHis life was a constant testimony for God, and its influence\nmust continue.\nAfter his funeral sermon was preached there were many\npenitent seekers after Christ. So the great Head maintains\nhis work.\n(Notice in the Methodist Recorder, March 6th 1890.)\n**A President of Wesleyan Conference.\n1890_Record_Death_Methodist_Times.pdf\n1890_Death_Certificate_John_CLARK.pdf\nRegistration District, Strood.\nDeath in the Sub-district of Northfleet in the County\nof Kent.\nNo 288 | Twenty Fourth January 1890, Ridgeway Shorne Strood R.S.D.\nName, John CLARK | Male | 80 yrs\nOccupation, Proprietor of Houses\nCause of Death, Influenza Epidemic?)

R. Wansey\nbeing engaged in mission work in the coal and copper mining\ndistricts of the Island of Hondo. He went out to Japan\nunder the auspices of the Church Missionary Society;\nbut as the result of becoming personally acquainted with\nsome members of the Society of Friends and the study of\nQuaker literature, he was led to adopt Friends' views\nand to put them into practice in his life and work. He\nfelt that he could not conscientiously remain as a clergyman\nof the Established Church, and consequently resigned his\nposition under the C.M.S., thereby losing the financial\nsupport of that Society.\nIn 1910, after receiving a visit from Henry Clark, a member\nof Darlington Monthly Meeting, who was touring in Japan,\nH. R. Wansey applied to that Monthly Meeting for membership\nand was accepted, the application being strongly supported\nby H. Clark and by other Friends in Japan. From all sources\ngood reports have been recieved with respect to H. R.\nWansey's work, and Darlington Friends, as well as members\nof other Monthly Meetings, have interested themselves\nin his work. Edward Backhouse of White House, Stockton-on-Tees,\nand Ernest O. D.

The land together\nwith all building, plant and machinery had previously\nbeen owned by Stephen Cox (the lease being for\nthe annual rent of £120) was to be auctioned\nin the Commercial Rooms in Corn Street pursuant\nto an order from the Chancery Court. The London\nGazette reports that particulars of the property\ncould be viewed in the offices of Palmer and Wansey\non Corn Street.\nWansey could not have been in practice for very\nlong, being born in 1827 in Warminster. He was\nto move to Clifton, building a house called Sambourne\non the Clifton Downs near to Sea Walls. Wansey\nwas a Non-Conformist, enjoyed hunting and shooting\nand went on regular fly-fishing holidays to Ireland\nand Scotland. He came to the Law at an early age,\npractising from the early 1950s. He first went\ninto partnership with Henry Palmer, who was his\nbrother-in-law, and in 1860 Wansey became Registrar\nof the Tolzey Court (a position that Palmer had\npreviously held) later becoming a Deputy Judge.\n[Henry Andrews PALMER married Margaret WANSEY (Bn 1808 Dd 1839) on the 25th July 1835 att Saint Denys, Warminster. They had one known child, Emily E. PALMER (Bn 22nd Jan 1837)\nEmily E. PALMER married Rev John Meek CLARK in 1865 at Clifton, Gloucestershire. They had three children Margaret, Marian & Basil.]\nIn 1863 A.H. Wanseys office was at 24 Clare Street,\nwhich was also the Tolzey Court Office, while in 1887\nhis office was in St. Stephens Chambers on Baldwin\nStreet. Wanseys son Arthur Edward joined him in\npractice following his passing of the Law examinations,\nbut sadly died in 1892. By 1897 A.H. Wanseys firm\nwas still known under the title of A.H. Wansey and Son,\nalthough his only other surviving son had joined the\nChurch. Following the death of his son, Wansey went\ninto partnership with Edward Meade-King and by 1908\nthe firm was known as Wansey and Meade-King.\nWansey died in October 1902 aged 74 and his obituary\nin the Bristol Mercury described him as a man of commanding\npresence and looks with a genial and kindly nature.\nHe had an 'old time courtesy which impressed itself\non all those who had dealings with
