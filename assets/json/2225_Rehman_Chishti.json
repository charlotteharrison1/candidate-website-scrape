  "https_www_rehmanchishti_com_/http_www_rehmanchishti_com_news_why-we-must-increase-punishment-powers-drink-drivers/content_17.html": "This article originally appeared in the Kent on Sunday (6 July 2013)\nWe should all know the dangers of getting behind the wheel after we’ve had a few drinks – it can make an accident six times more likely to happen.\nBut whilst there has been a significant cultural shift over the past 30 years in our attitudes towards drink driving, there are still a persistent minority of motorists who continue to place their own and other people’s safety at risk.\nFor many years, Kent Police, working with Kent and Medway road safety teams, has run successive and successful campaigns reminding drivers not to drink and drive on our county’s roads.\nBut it is still a prevalent issue. For example, in just one month, over the Christmas period, 221 people were arrested across Kent and Medway for being over the legal limit.\nKent is also one of the top police areas for people caught driving under the influence of alcohol, with a total of 2,157 people arrested in 2012.\nAnd the dangers of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol are clear – a person is killed in a collision on Kent’s roads every week with one in six of these deaths linked to drink driving.\nEven a cursory glance in the local papers show weekly reports of drink driving incidents, with most of the motorists caught being two, three or even five times over the existing drink drive limit of 35mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath.\nAnd they are all too likely to go on and commit the same offence again. It has been reported in Medway that a driver has been caught five times in 11 years but has still escaped a prison sentence.\nIt is clear to me that more should and can be done to reduce drink driving on our roads. This is why this week I have proposed a new Bill in Parliament to introduce tougher penalties for those who persistently drink and drive.\nDid you know that the maximum sentence someone can currently receive for drink driving is six months?\nAnd it’s the same for a first, second or even a fourth offence.\nUnder my proposals those caught drink driving for a third offence could face up to two years in jail.\nThe current penalties are not a powerful enough deterrent for the minority of drivers who continue to flagrantly disregard the law and put the safety of others on the road at risk.\nMore people are in fact killed as a result of drink driving than from knife crime. So why is it the case that the maximum penalty for carrying a knife is four years, but only six months for drink driving?\nMy proposal has been adopted in other countries such as in New Zealand where those caught over the limit for a third, or subsequent offence, face two years imprisonment.\nAnd it’s a system we already have in place for other crimes, such as burglary, where an offender is automatically given a minimum prison sentence for a third offence.\nI believe that it’s a system we need to put in place too for drink driving. In order to reduce drink driving casualties further we need to take a tougher stance and this proposal will send a clear message to those who continue to drink and drive that they will face up to two years in prison.",

  "https_www_rehmanchishti_com_/http_www_rehmanchishti_com_news_we-must-push-reform-pakistan%E2%80%99s-blasphemy-laws/content_36.html": "This article orginally appeared on Conservative Home.\nThis week Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting London. One of the issues that I have urged the Prime Minister, David Cameron, to raise is the reform of Pakistan’s outdated blasphemy laws. These have been used to persecute and prosecute the Christian community and they tarnish Pakistan’s name and reputation.\nThese laws are, as the Minister admitted during my recent debate on this subject in Parliament, “dangerous” and “open to abuse for personal gain”.\nUnder Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, victims can face life imprisonment or even the death sentence. They were expanded during the 1980s by General Zia Ul Haq, who added several clauses including sections that stated anyone who defamed the Prophet had to be killed.\nThey are often used to punish minorities and to settle personal vendettas. The shocking figures demonstrate their wide spread abuse. In the past 15 years, 1274 people have been charged under the laws in comparison with 9 reported cases between 1929 and 1982.\nPakistan now has the largest number of prisoners of belief with at least 14 individuals on death row and 19 more serving life sentences, according to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom.\nSeveral high profile cases show how these laws have been misapplied. For example, Mohammad Asghar, a vulnerable British national with a history of mental illness, was sentenced to death in January. The court failed to take into account his illness and authorities have restricted access to independent medical experts.\nMany readers will know of the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian, who has been languishing in a prison since June 2009 after receiving a death sentence for allegedly blaspheming the Prophet following a dispute with fellow farm workers. Bibi’s case is still awaiting an appeal but has been postponed numerous times.\nBut even the justice system cannot protect these victims. In Pakistan, just an accusation of blasphemy can lead to violence against the innocent. There are too many cases where those acquitted face the injustice of the mob, such as Ghulam Abbas who was pulled from a police station and beaten to death, his body burned.\nIf Asia Bibi is ever released, then her life will be forever in danger. Her family is already in hiding after receiving death threats, and there is a real danger she could be murdered or poisoned in prison.\nRecently, there were reports of rioting when Sawan Masih, another Christian, was sentenced to death for blasphemy. Dozens of Christian homes and two churches were set on fire.\nI know that reform will be difficult in Pakistan. Let us not forget that those who have spoken out, such as the former Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti and politician Salmaan Taseer, have found their own lives sadly cut short. But I do not think that it is impossible.\nChanges are needed to take blasphemy cases away from the lower courts which are susceptible to intimidation and put them in the hands of the higher courts. Specialist prosecutors and judges should be appointed to deal with these cases. Pakistan already has special terrorist courts, there could be specialised courts dealing with blasphemy cases. These are short term changes, whilst in the long term these laws must be abolished.\nProsecutions could also be authorised by a body in the Ministry of Law so that once an allegation has been made to the police all the facts and evidence can be assessed before an individual is charged.\nAs Prime Minister Sharif has said, the UK is one of Pakistan’s closest allies. We can, as an ally, use our influence to urge the country to reform the outdated laws which deprive people of their basic human rights.\nOur foreign policy towards Pakistan should promote respect for human rights, for freedom of religion and for belief. I hope that the Prime Minister will make the case for reform when Sharif is our guest in London.",

  "https_www_rehmanchishti_com_/http_www_rehmanchishti_com_news_increased-use-drones-needs-serious-discussion/content_35.html": "This article originally appeared in The Eastern Eye.\nWe are witnessing a rapid expansion of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, in armed conflicts around the world.\nWhilst drones offer the potential to avoid having to place our armed forces in harm’s way, there use, and the Government’s policy on drones, appears to be clouded in secrecy.\nDo we know if they are being deployed proportionately and whether enough is being done to prevent civilian casualties?\nI believe that a review is needed into how they are currently used and how they may be developed and deployed in the future.\nThe Government appears to see them as having an increasingly greater role in our armed forces. Last year they decided to double the number of drones in Afghanistan and, for the first time, move their operations to the UK. Previously the UK’s drones have been operated by British personnel from Creech air force base in Nevada.\nBut we are so intertwined with the United State’s drone programme that our pilots have flown over 2,000 missions using America’s drones in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. This means it becomes very difficult to determine accountability and responsibility if civilians are killed.\nAmerica’s prolific use of drones, as part of their counter terrorism strategy in countries including Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties.\nAlthough the true number is not know, it has been estimated that in around 360 strikes in Pakistan, more than 3500 people may have been killed including at least 884 civilians.\nThis has fed into an anti-western feeling, with 74% of Pakistanis now seeing the US as an enemy and only 17% supporting their use of unmanned strikes.\nThe distress caused by drone strikes in Pakistan has been detailed in a report from Stanford University and New York University. In it the authors’ describe the strikes effects on cultural, religious and community life, with some families even refusing to send children to school, in case they are attacked.\nAnd so called “double tap” strikes, where the same area is attacked multiple times, has deterred humanitarian assistance.\nAt a time when Pakistan is facing severe poverty and one in four are living on £1 a day or less, it also threatens to undermine the work achieved through international aid. By 2015 Pakistan could become the UK’s largest recipient of aid, reaching £446m a year. Yet this good will is threatened by the West’s military activities.\nOne victim of a drone strike was Daud Khan, a local tribal elder from Dattakhel, who was killed in March 2011 along with forty people whilst attending a Jirga (tribal council meeting).\nHis son, Noor Khan, has launched legal proceedings in the UK alleging that the British Government provided locational intelligence to the CIA about individuals of interest to the United States and that this intelligence is then used to direct drone attacks in Pakistan.\nThe legal statement for this case asserts that if Government officials assisted the CIA to direct armed attacks in Pakistan, they are in principle liable under domestic criminal law.\nSuch allegations damage our relationship with Pakistan, who will draw their own inferences from the Government’s refusal to confirm or deny whether intelligence has been shared with the United States. This fosters anti west sentiments, which could be a danger to our own security.\nWe need to ensure that Afghanistan and Pakistan are safe and secure countries however drone strikes can undermine the important battle of winning over hearts and minds.\nThese issues deserve serious considerations and if drones are to become more widely used, then we must ensure they are deployed so as not to risk civilian deaths, collateral damage, our international relations and do not pose a danger to our own national security. We must ensure that the UK’s policy on drones and sharing intelligence which may be used in drone strikes in fully compliant with relevant national and international law.",

  "https_www_rehmanchishti_com_/http_www_rehmanchishti_com_news_there-are-better-alternatives-thames-estuary-airport/content_28.html": "There are many economic and environmental reasons why the Thames estuary is not a suitable location for a new hub airport.\nThese reasons - from the serious threat of bird strikes to the SS Richard Montgomery, packed full of explosives - have been well-debated.\nGiven this, it is no surprise that the idea has not found favour with the public, the major airlines or MPs. Only recently a survey by Ipsos MORI disclosed that only 16% of MPs support the idea.\nBut let us consider for a moment, what would be the impact of such an airport on Kent and Medway?\nOne of the proposals is for a four runway airport, operating 24 hours a day and handling up to 150 million passengers a year. Such a vast airport, which would be twice as large as Heathrow, would require significant infrastructure and transport links to support it.\nIt is suggested that this could be achieved through linking the airport to the existing high speed rail service. Whilst there may currently be spare capacity on the train line – Eurostar only uses 40% of it – there is interest from several European train operators in running new passenger and freight services in the next few years.\nIn short, new train lines would have to be built, carving up our communities and the countryside. It is more than likely we would also witness a repeat of the challenges seen over the High Speed two route as such lines would pass through parts of Kent and Essex.\nAnd it would require major road access. To avoid congestion the M2 would have to be upgraded or new motorways built to handle such demand.\nAirports also rely heavily on supporting services and industries and Kent could only accommodate them through building vast new industrial estates.\nAn airport of this proportion would require at least 70,000 employees, which is even more than those who are unemployed in Kent and Medway. It would result in an influx of new arrivals and where would all these people live?\nClearly it would require new homes, schools and hospitals, piling pressure on existing services.\nTo put the scale of this into some context, Medway’s annual housing target is 815 dwellings per year up to 2028, far less than the thousands of homes that would be required to support a new airport.\nSuch developments could threaten our existing green areas such as Capstone Valley and the North Downs Way, located in a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nOn top of this is the environmental impact on those living in the areas surrounding the airport who will see increased noise, light and air pollution.\nSupporters of the scheme say that it is worth sacrificing Kent and Medway for the thousands of jobs it would create. But such jobs would be decades away and not the jobs we need to create now and that are being created through our regeneration schemes.\nIf an airport in the Thames estuary was allowed to go ahead it would irrevocably alter Kent and Medway. I do not believe that this is the solution to our aviation needs. There are much better alternatives which will be considered as part of the Government’s review.",
